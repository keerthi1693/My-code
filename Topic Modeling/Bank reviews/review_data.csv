0,Bad Credit Union With Awful Customer Service!!,37557,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,42742,1,Opened an account with Georgia's Own Credit Union for me and my wife as they are local. Never received our debit cards in the mail. After 7 different conversations and 4 months later we finally received our debit cards in the mail. Once I received the debit cards I switched my direct deposit over. Direct deposit it kicked back to my employer because Georgia's Own closed the account right after I finally received the debit cards due to inactivity. Very very poor customer service. My experience was that they do not take care of their members and I have received better service at bigger banks.,2019-06-03
1,Bunch Of Immoral Thieves,35365,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,53766,1,"Stay away from these thieves at all costs. They literally put an 11 day hold on a payroll check. Not a personal check. <br/>They have zero warning that my tent money would be unavailable for this length of time and cost me tongs in late fees. Terror warming on deposit days it might be up to 2 days... Not 11.<br/>Now they are claiming that it takes them that looking to verify that the funds are actually available, on a payroll check from a fortune 300 company written on a major bank check (not a hand written personal check).<br/>These are either thieves, or they are so incompetent that they cannot do simple ach verification with major banks.<br/>Do yourself a favor and run as fast and far from these low life thieves as you can.<br/> They will lie to you and do everything in their power to screw up everything they touch.<br/>Avoid at all costs!",2018-10-20
2,Georgia's Own Credit Union,30419,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,45277,2,I joined Georgia's Own Credit Union about 20 years ago hoping for good interest rates but their rates are about the same as most lending institutions. I also liked the fact that you didn't have to carry a minimum in your checking but they changed that a couple months ago and I never saw a notice about it and only realized it when I logged into my account.,2017-11-19
3,Many years of excellent service!,27846,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,39160,5,"I begin my relationship with Georgia's Own Credit Union back in 1998 when it used to be called Georgia Telco. At that time I was an employee of At&t in Augusta, GA. When I first signed up there was not a branch in the area so it was all done via mail or over the phone. However, even then the customer service was excellent. One example was when I was trying to open a savings account for my oldest daughter. I had to submit the paperwork to prove I was her mother and that she was in fact who she was, this was before verifying identity via the internet. Everyone was so helpful setting that up. Since then I have continued to have my savings account as well as my daughters and there is now a local branch in my area. I have always received great customer service when visiting the bank to add money to the savings accounts or when I was checking the balances. I will continue to have my savings accounts there for years to come.",2017-05-31
4,A great local credit union,27276,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,38108,4,"Georgia's Own Credit Union is a local credit union in Georgia. They offer many different services, as you would expect from a credit union. I initially was turned on to them by an auto salesman when I was purchasing my first vehicle. He let me know that they historically had the lowest rates of the banks and credit unions they work with. I ultimately ended up using them for my auto loan, and I used them for a bank as I was in college. Their rates were always great and the customer service was always satisfying. I will say that they were behind on technology, however. Overall, a great credit union to work with.",2017-04-01
5,This Credit Union Stinks,27155,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,37827,1,"Terrible credit union! I made a deposit in the night deposit box to my business account. Did not credit it to my account over 24 hours later. Called to ask them why, and of course no one answered the phone, and no one called me back. <br/><br/>STAY AWAY FROM HERE!!!!!!",2017-03-14
6,Small Town Feel Big Town Quality,20614,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,22520,5,"I have not done much business directly with my bank, Georgia's Own Credit Union, but the amount that I have done has been very positive. I am mainly reviewing the experience at one branch, but also will go into some minor details about the web and Android mobile app experience. The branch is really well kept and has a great amount of little extras, such as access to a restroom, which most banks I have been in do not have, as well as access to a single serving pod style coffee machine, a little above what most banks have. They recently moved and I have not had a reason to use their teller machine at the new location, so I am not going to review it, as the experience might have improved. The branch is located just out of way enough in town that you need not worry about fighting traffic to get in and out of the branch, but close enough to town that you are not going to be inconvenienced greatly by having to go to the branch location. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>The web site is decently modern, built more for function rather than flash, but that is a good thing. The functionality of the user experience, such as transferring funds from one account to another, actually feels more at ease sometimes than managing an email inbox from a laptop computer. The mobile version of the site is pretty well done too, but feels a little feature stripped compared to the full version, but that is normal. The Android mobile app functions beautifully and is a great counterpart to the full site and makes transferring funds a snap from one account to another. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>One of the best things about Georgia's Own is that they charge no fees for their basic checking account. In this world of high fees being charged by banks, this is a nice change of pace and refreshing breath of air to be able to have a checking account with a widely accepted Visa debit card.",2015-03-23
7,Terrible Service!,19355,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,20924,1,"I started using the credit union because people told me that they are so much better than a bank. People told me that they will help you because it's based on members. THIS IS SO FALSE! In the past everything that I've ever asked of Georgias Own I have been turned down. I have never heard the word ""yes"" from them for anything. This place is so much worse then a regular bank. I would NEVER recommend using them. I regret leaving Bank of America for the credit union. The worst!",2014-12-16
8,Great first experience with a credit union,18779,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,20241,5,"GA's Own Credit Union was my first credit union to ever be a member of. The first thing that drew me to this bank is my Father has banked with them for years and has loved it. Secondly, when I tried to get an auto loan through my old (larger) bank, I was turned down do to not having much credit. Because of my family's history with GA's Own, they approved my loan same day. Their checking accounts are also free and easy to use in person, online, and mobile. Since becoming a member, every company I have worked for has offered direct deposit, so naturally I take advantage of it. There has never been any issues and my paycheck has always arrived within 24 hours unlike some banks where it seems to take up to 48 hours some times. They have a friendly staff, who also went out of their way to explain to me how their merchant services work when I was interested in setting up e-commerce on my web site.",2014-11-04
9,Georgia's Own,18391,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,19754,4,When I went to apply for a bank account I was met with a warm smile and understanding attitude. I opened an account very easily with the bank manager. I was informed of all the fees upfront. I have since had an amazing experience with the bank. My only problem is that the bank is that they are not open at great hours and their location is a bit out of the way. The other benefits greatly out weigh the negatives.,2014-10-14
10,No fees/ Free Checking!,17806,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,18917,4,"I used to do business with a large bank chain, but was getting charged for my checking accounts. A little here and there, but it all adds up. I switched to Georgia's Own Credit Union and have never been charged for anything. The staff are always helpful and friendly when I have to visit a branch. There are multiple branches around town that can be of convenience to everyone. The only downside of it being a credit union is there is a drive through branch that you can go to to withdraw or deposit money after hours. You can only go when they are actually open and you have to go inside to visit one of the tellers. I've never had any problems with my banking. I can call 24/7 with questions or concerns or send a message through the customer website. The company if very efficient in getting back to me in a timely manner.",2014-09-06
11,Loan Application,15256,20042,Georgia's Own Credit Union,14480,1,"I suppose you never know if you have a good bank or not till the time you need them. Applying for a loan online I discovered is not the best way of doing it. Messages appear ""need more info"" on online application and that is it. After several responses from my side to provide ""info"" no response from the institution. At the end my application was denied, not giving me the chance to provide more information. I will not encourage anybody in using the online options. I'm plain disappointed in Georgia's Own.",2013-09-23
12,Bank Of America Online Billpay SUCKS,39424,772,Bank of America,64264,1,"On September 30, an online bill pay was scheduled for my daughter’s preschool. Unfortunately, the payment was sent to the wrong address. I contacted Bank of America, and changed the address & asked them to reissue another check. Sadly, the change was never updated and an additional check was issued to another wrong address. After communicating with the preschool, two weeks later, the checks had still not arrived. Another check was issued, this time with the correct address, but it was expected to arrive a month after the payment due date. I requested another check be mailed using overnight service & a refund of a $50 late fee was issued by the bank, since the preschool was no longer patiently waiting for their payment. The check arrived the following day, so I thought my concerns with Bank of America were resolved. Unfortunately, a week later, my online bill pay account experienced some dramatic failures. I have alerts set up on my account, to be sent to the same email address that has been active on my account since I opened it 15 years ago. The alerts are for when money is transferred into my account & when my account is overdrawn. I did not receive any of those alerts to my email. This is the first time this has ever happened. I was charged $70 for overdrawn items. After contacting Bank of America and speaking with two supervisors, they were only willing to refund one overdrawn fee, despite making false statements about the accuracy of my email address and the accuracy of the alerts set up on the accounts. They claimed that alerts that had been set up on my account for many years were not active, despite receiving one through my mobile app the morning of the dispute. I’m concerned that the overall accuracy of my account has been compromised. There unwillingness to refund the charges, when obviously strange and unaccounted for discrepancies happened, is not only disappointing and upsetting, but the lack of accountability from Bank of America is shameful. I was charged late fees for discrepancies solely related to bank errors. They claim that since the bills were paid in full, with no late fees (this time) that they were not willing to issue any further refunds. I have been a customer for 15 years, never had any issues as dramatic and upsetting as this & the lack of customer support is disgusting. I hope my experience can be used as a learning tool for other customers. TAKE YOUR MONEY TO A DIFFERENT BANK!",2019-11-02
13,"Good Bank, Terrible Interest On Basic Savings",37938,772,Bank of America,60430,4,"I've had my account with them since 2009 with no problems at all. Their basic savings account pays one penny per month in interest, and you have to maintain it at $500 per month, or you get charged a fee. I kept BofA for my basic checking, and switched to Vio for savings. It seems to be a really good fit for me so far.",2019-07-04
14,Bank Of America Worst Bank,37901,772,Bank of America,60343,1,"Why would anyone waste their money opening up a checking account with Bank of America when Capital One is free and even pays you interest. I opened up an account only because of the cashback bonus in which I met all the qualifications and they decided not to pay I spent hours on the phone and in the bank on this issue and it was not resolved correctly, this is a horrible Bank do not waste your time and money.",2019-07-02
15,BANK OF AMERICA CLOSED ACCOUNTS,37858,772,Bank of America,60244,1,"I never like bank of America, but when I went back to work for a old employer I decided to open one up online I then got approved, 5days before I was to receive my 1st check they closed the account and didn't explain why ,when I called to ask if there any way they can re open it and I'll pay the fee just to get my money they said no they couldn't do that now I have to wait 7days and other 10 from my employer to issue a check my Bill's will be late and I'm be late in my rent due to bank of America this is a worse bank to bank with no wonder they are high risk",2019-06-28
16,Wrongful Banking To Elderly People,37400,772,Bank of America,59116,1,"Bank of America shut Joe Woodruff Bank account down after 28 years without any warning.. They close it the day his S. S. I. Came. Bank of America stated that they mailed it on may 5,2019 he still hasn't received it. They sent it to the wrong address and they had the right address. Banks of America also stated that if they stop payment on it it will be 91days before he will receive the new print out check. Bank of America is rude and down right disrespectful to the elderly people. What ever you do don't bank with BANK OF AMERICA AT ALL.",2019-05-23
17,"Restricted Card, Hung Up On Hold",37329,772,Bank of America,59007,1,"So, my chip got damaged as it usually does. I order a new card, and while I wait I’m forced to withdraw cash for things. Well, BoA thinks that’s odd and puts a hold on my card. No worries, a text comes through letting me confirm I am indeed me. Only, the holds still there. So i call, and the first specialist after a fifteen minute wait can’t do anything and transfers me to a department that can. Okay. After another ten minute wait, the phone just hangs up. They hung up on me, on hold, stranded, unable to pay for anything like gas, etc etc. I called back only I’ve lost my spot in the queue.",2019-05-19
18,Hope You Like Fees,36998,772,Bank of America,57962,1,"My account had money in it when I left for deployment. When I got back, they had drained all my money and kept taking until my account was negative $400. Now they are suing me for $500. Thanks.",2019-04-17
19,Awful Check Deposit Policy And Customer Service,36901,772,Bank of America,57621,1,"Bank of America is the worst bank I have ever banked with. Their policy on check Cashing is awful. Every time I have deposited a check it is put on hold for 3+ days. Even if it is from a company that uses Bank of America. You can call them multiple times and they still won’t release the hold saying it’s a system process they can’t do anything about. Then if in those three days a charge comes through they charge you a NSF charge even though they are holding a $3,000+ check. Awful awful awful customer service. And god forbid you use their app to deposit it. They don’t even give you $200 available that they would give you if you go in to the store. When I called they said they can’t trust the account the check was written from has funds... the account is from a corporation that uses their bank and is a million dollar corporation..... Do not bank with them if you ever plan on depositing a check with them. This is just the last of many frustrating situations I have had with them. I am closing this account once they finally release the hold.",2019-04-07
20,HSA Accounts,36323,772,Bank of America,54822,3,"Two years ago I went into my local BA branch to open a HSA account for my wife. They advertised HSA accounts online but I couldn't accomplish a transaction, so I went to the branch a few miles away where I maintained a corporate account. (THAT's a whole other story of abuse I won't recount here.). At the branch, after staff making a phone call, they told me BA had discontinued opening any new HSA accounts earlier that year. I suggested they delete the HSA service from their advertisements and web site. (To no avail since I note in the summary above they still reference HSA accounts.) I ended up setting her HSA up with an on line account using another bank specializing in HSA accounts. So, their advertising on HSA accounts is false. don't waste your time trying to deal with BA on HSA accounts or any banking issues that are out of the normal daily routine. Between their odd banking policies and uninformed staff, they can't offer personalized banking. You get the corporate template of banking services, B of A style.",2019-02-03

22,Hellish Nightmare. The Absolute Worst!,35801,772,Bank of America,54537,1,"First they were eating up my checking account with fees because I went slightly below $1500 and my ATM card took 3 mo to arrive after I opened the account. So I switched to a Savings account which prevents me from being able to use my debit card for anything other than cash withdrawals. Then my teenaged son was going to Columbia alone and I needed a way to transfer him money so he would to be able to get small amounts of cash out while he was there, so foolishly, we got him two accounts. We spent an hour with a lovely person at the bank, explaining the situation, showing her all our documents, my account etc. I get home to find out that I CANNOT transfer money from my account to his at all. I spend 30 min a day for a week trying to get this sorted out before I have to go to Europe where I won’t have phone or wifi. I spend most of that time in voice-jail because there are no options to speak to a human. All my attempts to transfer get put on some bs fraud-alert hold, even when I do them with BofA staff on the line. Now with hours left before my flight and my teen about to have insufficient travel funds during my absence, I am losing my mind spending 2.5 hours on the phone trying to get something sorted instead of packing. During this same time I had sent a $2000 cheque from another bank and waited 4 weeks for it to get posted! Now they have sent a demand to see his Social Security card again and are threatening to suspend his account if he doesnt find some way receive, sign and return some form in the next six days. They do not seem to comprehend there is no Fedex service in the jungle and they are threatening an 18 year old boy with being unable to eat or even get to the airport to return home by cutting off his funds. BofA is famous for being greedy, fee-gobblers and they along with Wells Fargo are both reputed as the worst among US banks but torturing clients with bureacracy and threatening/stressing out this child is a whole new level of evil. SHAME ON the management and policies. The app would be awesome if it allowed me to actually do a transfer. The people at my branch are nice but seem to have no ability to help customers when problems arise.",2018-12-01
23,Awful Bank Due To Horrible Regulations,34598,772,Bank of America,52084,1,"My husband and me just got married this past week-end. We deposited our checks and they are holding a bank check till August 1st when they said we could haev cashed it and had the funds right away vs waiting for the deposit to clear. This was the last straw so we are leaving the bank with our familes...Bank of america lost a lot of money and we have had nothing but troubles with them not keeping track of accounts. We have had several incidents where Money was overdrafted due to processing then fixed and having to fight them for their automated crap. Due to them not giving money on direct deposits from Amazon for a day or so we would wind up missing bills. They would tell us we could do nothing but wait for them to resolve disputed charges where some reason it was rang up twice for food. We would pay a 5 dollar safe checking fee on my account not my husbands to never have to worry about overdrafts and they would still do overdrafts. We called on multiple days, sat with several physical Tellers, managers, and supervisors, and even made them get on a three way merge call with my grandmother's bank for the current check having issues through them which is one of those checks you have to buy with money and is considered cash. It is very dissatisfying that our honeymoon was cut short due to the bank being unjust and not resolving or being able to verify over the phone when they had all these simple solutions they should have been able to do without their clunky software and locks. We did talk to several other banks who said that they can do that since each bank has its own policies but most banks would have had the money resolved since its been technically 4 days now. Due to all these issues we decided to pull our money and go to an alternative bank. Our families are doing the same which means they lost way more money then they anticipated. <br/><br/>Please note if these regulations and computer systems they had in place were not 1s and 0s like black vs white answers then it would be a whole lot better but due to them not having one person be able to resolve issues without having to hold stuff forever or take a week to correct what the bank really has due to processing transactions. I swear they only update on a specific few days a week so your checking account is never accurate.<br/><br/>On a positive note the application process is not bad and I didn't have much issues when i got my gender change with them changing the info and changing account types. They do try to keep you safe and lock accounts for activity that feels different from what they usually see but its all mostly automated. Sucks when you need to wait an hour for it to unlock again due to the fact that it autolocked from buying from a different store, site, or in a different state than it is usually active. Other than that and easy access to an overly placed atm everywhere from being such a huge company It really feels not worth it.",2018-07-25
24,Vampires The Whole Bank. Awful.,34090,772,Bank of America,51157,1,I’ve been with them since 2009. Worst bank ever. They just want to suck you dry with unfair fees and stupid rules that make up for fun. Will never bank with them again and discourage everyone I know to ditch them and not use them.,2018-06-05
25,Horrible Experience Banking,33884,772,Bank of America,50734,1,"Bank of America is the worse , they are liars, deceivers and can careless for their customers. They only look forward to the profit and money they gain. I have gone TWICE to the Bank of America in Brooklyn to retrieve my money from my saving account after closing the account with them. I closed the account because they charged an overdraft fee which I acknowledge. It was not an error, it was taken , I made sure I called them to explain that I had the money in another account but if I would have gotten an alert of the account being in negative at the moment I would have transferred money and the overdraft would not have happened.",2018-05-23
26,One of Many Banks,33788,772,Bank of America,50586,3,"I opened an account with Bank of America when I was 18 and just stayed with them since. Since the start of my account, I opened two credit cards with them and are satisfied with both. Their mobile app is simple to use and a very clean design. I never had a problem with their customer service. Besides Bank of America, I also hold accounts under other financial institutes.

Bank of America has a basic checking account and one that bears a minimal amount of interest.The internet banking offered by bank of america is easy to use. The user interface of the website is good and easy to use.The transfer of money from bank of america to another bank is made easy with it's internet banking .

30,Great Bank,32955,772,Bank of America,49914,4,"I had a great experience setting up a checking account with Bank of America. They have had excellent customer service. I had a lot of questions regarding how to set up an account and the details of the account such as a minimum balance. I also had questions about a minimum opening account amount. I wanted my paycheck to be direct deposited, so I had questions. I had a lot of questions They were able to answer them honestly and answer a few questions that I did not think about. The agent was so patient with me. They were able to set me up with a checking account with very little trouble on my part. They issued me a debit / ATM card. I received this card in the mail in a reasonable time period. I use this account everyday without any problems. I will be banking with them from now on. Thank you",2018-04-27
31,Not the best but not the worst,32912,772,Bank of America,49874,3,"For several years, I had my checking and savings account with Bank of America. It's an okay bank. It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. Customer service is usually fine, it really depends on who you get. Some are great, some are not. I remember one manager telling me that I had to have a ""consular"" ID, when my country does not even have consular ID's. The manager swore they did. Perhaps he was confused with another country. He was super rude to me. That was the last straw for me. I closed my account and went to another bank that has much better service, and ATM's everywhere. <br/>Another thing is that Bank of America has very few ATM's so you will find yourself having to withdraw money at other banks, which will cost you a lot in fees.",2018-04-23
32,"Good ideas, poor customer follow thru",32838,772,Bank of America,49799,3,"When we first started using Bank of America we loved them. Their website was great, very user friendly and easy to navigate. And honestly if we could have used Bank of America without having to use tellers, we might have kept our accounts with them. Every time we went in to make a deposit or withdrawal they would ask us if we wanted to sign up for a credit card or upgrade our account or something else every time! And we would kindly decline every time. And 2 weeks later it was the same story. Can you just put a note in our account that we're not interested??? No, they didn't. Every time we went we were asked over and over again. We liked the rates we had with our savings and checking accounts. We also liked how great it was that they had locations everywhere. We had a branch close to our home and all over the city that we lived close to, so it was always accessible if we needed it. As well as when we would travel to visit other family or go on vacations, but those darn questions every time were enough to drive me crazy. I finally switched banks and I've never been pestered with questions again.",2018-04-14
33,Bank of America is so much better than my old bank,32834,772,Bank of America,49795,4,I switched to Bank of America from a regional bank. The regional bank was really nice but unable to offer the ease of banking that Bank of America can. The website experience of Bank of America is absolutely incredible. It is very smooth and the amount that you can handle just on the mobile app is amazing. Signing up for my checking and savings accounts in a Bank of America branch was very painless. The customer service that I received from the employee was very good. She actually called and checked on what I thought of my banking service a few weeks later. I also really like the number of branches that are seemingly everywhere. I would oftentimes have difficulty banking with my old bank because they weren't located around where I was attending college. Bank of America does not have that problem.,2018-04-14
34,Fine for a big corporate bank,32692,772,Bank of America,49475,3,"Bank of America is just ok. I like that they have ATMs everywhere; I also use BECU and it's harder to find a BECU ATM. Bank of America has charged me outrageous overdraft fees in the past, but now overdraft protection is linked to my credit card, which is a lower fee ($10 compared to $35). I've been banking with them since I was 16 and haven't closed my checking account because of comfort and familiarity I suppose. My main complaint with BOA is that a few years ago, I needed a new debit card for my account that I'd had for more than ten years and was told that I had hit a ""lifetime card replacement maximum"" and would need to close the account and open a new one, which is what I did. Turns out that this was probably a tactic so this teller could reach their new account quota because no one else has ever heard of this lifetime card maximum. I felt used and angry.",2018-04-09
35,Effective Banking,32653,772,Bank of America,49436,4,"I have been a Bank of America customer for over 12 years. I have checking, savings, and a credit card through them. What I like most about them is the convenience. Specifically their website. I pay off my credit card by just transferring money from my checking into my credit card. It is a simple click of the button. I get alerts when my accounts are low, when my card is used, or when a bill is due. It is so very convenient. The downside to Bank of America is the fees. You must know how much money you need to keep in each type of account, or else you will get fees at the end of the month. Another problem is the low interest rates on the savings account. However, the convenience factor more than makes up for this. I hope this review is helpful to anyone considering using Bank of America. Thank you!",2018-04-05
36,Frustrating fees,32449,772,Bank of America,49070,4,"I have been with Bank of America for many years. I first got an account right out of college because they had a promotion for newly graduated students. Since then I have been reasonably happy with this banking institution. The best thing about it is that it is a national bank, so I'm never lacking for a nearby branch. The promotion for my checking account expired a few years after I opened it, and I was switched to a regular checking account. It is fine, though I do have a monthly fee now, which is frustrating. I'm honestly thinking about moving to a credit union in order to bypass this monthly fee, even though it could potentially mean scarcer branch locations. I'm still chewing on that, but I'm sure eventually I'll move on.",2018-03-20
37,Highly Recommend,32443,772,Bank of America,49064,4,"I have banked with Bank of America for over 10 years now. I would highly recommend them to friends and family. I have a regular savings and checking account, and had a money market account until it was switched over. The best thing about Bank of America is the convenience. At any time of day I can transfer funds from one account to another. I can pay bills automatically online and never have to write out checks or pay manually. The interest rates are not great, but the convenience is the most important thing to me.",2018-03-19
38,Not told the right infomation,32441,772,Bank of America,49062,4,"When I first opened my checking account four years ago I was told about the fee, but was given the wrong information. I wouldn't be charged the fee if I was using the online service. The first couple months I wasn't charged the fee because I had over thousand dollars in my account which is one of the thing you have to have not to be charged the $12 monthly fee. I was going to the store to pay diapers for my son and I checked the bank. They had taken the $12 fee for the first time. Because of this I couldn't go right then to buy the diapers because my account was short what I need. I called the bank to figure out what was going on. They explain that I was charged the fee because I didn't meet the monthly requirements not too. I explained that I was told that if I had the online account I would not be charged that fee. I was then told that I was wrong and that they were sorry. I broke into tears telling them that because they took that money I was unable to buy my son diapers. They gave me back the money that time, but informed me that it would come out again next month.",2018-03-19
39,Bank of America,32408,772,Bank of America,48932,3,"Banking at Bank of America has been a pretty good experience for the most part. They were the first banking institution that I opened a checking account with. I was soon offered a credit card within a relatively short period of time. Customer service has always been very nice and helpful. I do believe that for the majority of my time banking with them, their site has been a little difficult to use. The design was a bit cluttered and complicated. I do believe that they've since updated to a more simple and user friendly design. I also had an issue with overdraft fees due to fraudulent transactions made on my account. The issues were later resolved but the fact that such large amounts were consecutively taken from my account when no money was left to use did make me worry.",2018-03-19
40,Amazed at the ATM,32377,772,Bank of America,48901,5,"My Bank of America account continues to impress me. The online banking is really convenient and easy to use. I like that I can deposit checks at home by taking pictures of the check. What really impressed me was depositing cash at an ATM for the first time. I just stuck a stack of money in the slot and the ATM counted the money extremely fast and accurate. I wonder how they got a machine to do that? Bank of America has excellent identity theft measure too that are automatic. If I am out of my usual spending area, they send me a message asking if I am still in possession of my card.",2018-03-16
41,Online banking has been a dream for me!,32357,772,Bank of America,48861,5,"Online banking with Bank of America has been an absolute lifesaver for me! It has saved me so much time and trips to the bank I am unable to even count. I frequently have checks to deposit, and you are now able to do this from online or your mobile device. You can literally just snap a picture of the check image and it will be verified and posted to your account. You also have the option to easily add a company or person to your billpay account and pay electronically or via check. I have not had to physically write a check in over 2 years thanks to this service. I am also able to easily transfer money between my accounts with Bank of America, including my savings! I also am able to easily send money to children. Would highly recommend!",2018-03-15
42,"Bank of America online, is OK",32295,772,Bank of America,48734,3,"For the longest time, I had serious troubles with the mobile version of the app. There are really annoying situations that require changing your password over and over. The account security is redundant. Also, it is really difficult to send money between accounts, especially on the mobile version, making it to where I had to go to the physical bank to pay my credit card bill. Super annoying app, and I don't think they're ever going to fix it.",2018-03-12
43,"Decent enough, lots of branches",32289,772,Bank of America,48728,4,"The best thing about Bank of America is how many locations.

It's possible to get better rates and lower fees at the local credit unions.",2018-03-11
44,Online Banking,32286,772,Bank of America,48725,4,"I've used Bank of America for over 10 years and they have added the online banking feature. I use this to check all my checking and savings. If I never need any help, I can use the online chat, which is very helpful if I'm at a place where I can't chat on the phone. They are usually very responsive and helpful. I've never had an issue with them. For example, if I need to dispute a charge, I can do it online and it gets resolved very quickly.",2018-03-11

46,"Not bad, Not Great",32102,772,Bank of America,48389,3,"I first switched to Bank of America checking when Washington Mutual was bought out by Chase and its free checking was killed off. Bank of America had a free checking in the form of eChecking account. This lasted a while and was functional until Bank of America killed it off only keeping it free and without fees with the usual minimum balance of direct deposit. While I was able to avoid fees, its the principle of the matter so for a time I considered Bank of America good but not its becoming more and more greedy. Its website and general features are fairly functional. Its the only Bank i know of that has a App for Windows 10 devices allowing me to use my laptop and its camera to deposit a check versus a phone.",2018-03-07
47,Good Experience,32023,772,Bank of America,48300,4,"In general, I've had a good experience with this bank. I've had an account here for over 3 years. When opening up a new account, customer service workers were clear, personable and accommodating; the transaction was completed by a representative a matter of a half hour. I also appreciate the convenient online features provided by this bank, such as mobile deposits and electronic money transfers, which have saved me a lot of time (for instance, I pay rent electronically every month directly from my checking account). I've never had a problem with any of these features, which is great. My only complaint is the monthly fee ($12.00, which seems kind of high) and the fees incurred by withdrawals from other banks' ATMs; however, this issue is avoidable most of the time. Overall, the customer service and convenience of mobile/web features has given me a pleasant experience with the institution, despite some of the fees.",2018-02-26
48,Closed Checking Account,31905,772,Bank of America,48123,1,"Without a reason. They gave me a number to call 8772406886. They said I did something suspicious.

49,Online banking with bank of america,31451,772,Bank of America,47508,5,"I have been using this service for years now and I can say that I am still very satisfied. I really enjoy there identity theft protection. Every time in the last few years I will always receive a phone call if there is anything out of the ordinary as far as my shopping habits. Granted, I understand that it could be a little scary that they know my spending habits; however, I would rather them knowing me as a person and how I spend, as opposed to not keeping up with how I manage my funds and the places I shop.",2018-02-03
50,The service has gotten worse.,31386,772,Bank of America,47400,4,I used to love this bank because they had great customer service and you could get a representative on chat. However within the past year you can never get anyone on chat and when you call customer service the hold time is very long .So that makes it very frustrating to get help when you need it . I wish they had better service and then I would be much happier,2018-01-29
51,Terrible Service,31515,772,Bank of America,47617,1,"I have been cashing mine and my boyfriends check for over a year now through BofA without any problems at all, tried to do the same for a friend who needed help and the check cleared half as if everything were normal and then the entire check is taken back out of the account, multiple overdraft charges and an embarrassing encounter trying to buy food and getting declined (and being unable to buy food for two days was another nice ancillary detriment) is leading me to close my account and let everyone and anyone I can know how downright awful this bank is. Do not bank with them.",2018-01-26
52,Love the online capabilities,31331,772,Bank of America,47322,5,"I love the idea of being able to track my expenses, not only on the web page but on my phone. I'm able to create a budget at the same time that I receive different tips and tricks to maximize my savings. Before using this I had to use different apps or link my account to another app. They have always being very kind when I need some help, additionally, getting new products has always been really simple. Considering the products, my savings and checking account are pretty straightforward, not sure if other banks has this but it transfers every week a certain amount of money from checking to savings, making Saving money something really simple. <br/>Oh, I've had some issues with duplicated cards, they've been really helpful. Immediately, without many questions I've gotten my money back.",2018-01-23
53,Banking Experience,31048,772,Bank of America,46698,5,"Bank of America provides a very easy user friendly experience. The ease of access makes it simple to open deposit accounts and/or for business. The customer service department is knowledgeable and ready to help customers with any questions they may have regarding their accounts including, transactions, transfers and other financial aspects of the account/s in question. Bank of America is a proven leader in the banking system most would say. The mobile platform offered by this bank is easy to use and secure. Without many fees and the ability to avoid fees for such things as maintenance, by doing simple tasks during the month which most customers do on a regular basis anyway makes saving on fees seem even more rewarding many may say.",2018-01-12
54,A good bank to bank with,31042,772,Bank of America,46692,4,I have been a loyal customer of Bank of America for over 8years. I have a merchant account associated with bank of america . They proved them self to be a great bank. Whenever i had a missing transaction or any problem i will just call them .There customer support so good and i'm glad that they respond quickly,2018-01-12
55,Bank experience,30934,772,Bank of America,46474,4,Very easy to work with. Reasonable and good interest rates. Their customer service is very good too. Never had to wait for a long period of time while on the phone and got the answers I was looking for right away.,2018-01-02
56,Bank of America,30928,772,Bank of America,46468,5,I've really enjoyed my time as customer of Bank of America. They are a great bank because they provide excellent customer service. They are usually busy but they do their best to see you quickly. They offer a lot of helpful services. They have even offered me a credit card with them. The workers are always friendly and they always greet you with a smile.,2018-01-01
57,Service has gone downhill,30750,772,Bank of America,46088,3,I have been a customer of Bank Of America for over 20 years. In the beginning it was a very good bank but that has changed over the past few years. First they got rid of the drive through windows so you either have to go into the bank or go to the atm machine which is always being worked on. Second they used to have it where if you were having an issue you can go online and speak with a rep but that has also been taken away . I do not know why they did that because it was really convenient. I believe they have let a lot of their staff go because even now when you call you wait at least 30 min to speak to a rep. To me that is very inconvenient and that is why although i have left this account open I now do my majority of banking at a credit union. I was very sad at how they went downhill and did not want to look for a new bank but really was not given any choice in the matter . i need banking i can depend on,2017-12-13
58,Very happy with Bank of America!,30740,772,Bank of America,46078,4,"I have had both savings and checking accounts with Bank of America for almost 20 years. I couldn't be more pleased with their customer service, online banking and user friendly mobile app.<br/> <br/>One of the main features I like about Bank of America is their ""Keep the Change"" way to save money. When you purchase something with your debit card, it automatically rounds up to the nearest dollar and moves that small amount of change into your linked savings account. By doing this, I've noticed my savings account grow and don't even realize I'm making deposits. The amount is so small you don't miss it (hence the name ""Keep the Change"". This is a great feature that Bank of America provides.<br/> <br/>Any time I've had to call for customer service, I have gotten nothing but the best US based representatives. They are helpful, knowledgeable and several times have gone above and beyond what I expect from a bank's customer service department. I'm sticking with Bank Of America, you can bank on that!",2017-12-11
59,Free Mobile Deposit,30634,772,Bank of America,45697,5,"I have had accounts with several different banks and currently Bank of American is my primary account. I am beyond pleased with their online services. Recently, I discovered that customers can do mobile deposits without a fee! That is so convenient for people like me, who rarely go to ATMs or branches, but get random checks sometimes. I have three children ages 1, 2, and 11 so there is no convenient time for me to go to a bank and I don't want to pay a fee to deposit my own money. Another feature that has been super convenient to my life is that overdraft protection. If I overdraw my account, I have until the close of business to make sure there are funds to cover the balance before I accrue any fees. Sometimes, I get paid the same day there are ACH debits so this satisfies both the bank and the person/institution I'm paying!",2017-12-07
60,Great App and Bank,30564,772,Bank of America,45625,5,"Bank of America is such a great bank. I've had many other bank accounts in my past and most of them charge me all these fees for things that are irrelevant. At other banks I ended up losing more money than I was putting in. Bank of America's app is also incredibly convenient, the mobile check deposit function is my favorite. It runs so smoothly and never gives me any issues when depositing my checks. The camera is always working well and I am never worried if I won't be able to deposit my check. The balance adjusts when the check clears so I know exactly how much is in my bank account and I don't need to worry if I have enough to clear my bills. Bank of America also has a great function when I can see the routing number and account number so it's easy to attach the account to some of my online bills whereas other accounts I have to search and search for the account number and routing number making it impossible to attach and link the bank account. This website makes everything work so effortlessly. I am even able to download my bank statements on the computer or using my phone. I really have no complaints with Bank of America's online presence, I feel as though their website is extremely user friendly. If I had a choice I would switch all my bank accounts to this bank because I've never had any problems with them.",2017-11-28
61,Identity Theft By BOA,30659,772,Bank of America,45732,1,"My wife's identity was stolen and my joint checking account emptied on 11/9/17. Worked with Bank of America to setup a new checking account and also have ""safety measures"" in place to protect my money. Last night (11/14/17) my identity was stolen and Bank of America allowed another fraud savings account be setup via their call center and my ""new"" joint account was emptied of what little money I could scrap together to live on until Bank of America decides to return my stolen money! The so called ""safety measures"" in place only applied to MY WIFE so they went after my identity! You would think Bank of America would have advised these ""safety measures"" be setup for both my wife and I!!! Working with Bank of America has been a nightmare - they have allowed fraud savings accounts be set up TWICE in a matter of a few days via their call center! So our nightmare continues at the hands of Bank of America as they will NOT return our money for at least 60 days! How are we to pay bills and enjoy the holidays when BOA has ALL OF OUR MONEY? So Beware - Don't use Bank of America - they do not Protect Your Money or return your stolen money nor do they protect you from creditors and BOA harassing you for payments/late fees.",2017-11-28
62,DO NOT AFFILIATE WITH BOA!,30537,772,Bank of America,45508,1,"I am small business owner and have been a BOA customer for 10 years. For 80% of those years I was happy with the service, if I cashed a check it was available to me the next day. They would even cash checks without the funds being available in my account. Over this past year I have have encountered ""POLICY CHANGES"" They now hold checks up to 10 days even tho I have cashed these before from the same clients. The customer service is horrible, they either have been talking over me or repeating the same thing over and over. Take it from a long time customer, DO NOT USE THIS BANK. . . the policies change at will and they will hold your money to accrue more interest for themselves. Again, DO NOT USE THIS,BANK",2017-11-23
63,I love my bank,30421,772,Bank of America,45279,4,I have banked with Bank Of America for 7 years now. I really do love the bank. I had never had an issue until I recently had been charged an over draft fee on my bank account. I called and they argued with me that it was a fair fee. The woman kept refusing to refund it even though I did not feel the fee was fair. I was transferred to a manager who realized there was a computer error. She fixed my account and refunded me the fee. She also sent me out a prepaid gift card. I think that little reward made up for the poor service but I was still unhappy overall. I think the overall experience is mixed. I have positive and negative.,2017-11-19
64,Good Military Bank,30321,772,Bank of America,44978,5,I signed up for this bank when I was enlisted in the Army. They set me on very fast and setup all the needed precautions in case something happened to me. I was overseas and had no charge for using the ATM and they always waived my overdraft fees if I was traveling and caused an issue with getting my money. I am very happy with them. They always went above and beyond to help me out and watch out for my account. I would get calls if my card was being used in a weird way or even a new place just to make sure it was me. I even got out of paying for some fraudulent charges because they called me and let me know that my card was being used in Nigeria by someone trying to buy stuff online. Very good bank and great staff cant say enough good things about them.,2017-11-12
65,Worst Bank Ever For Fees And Low Rates On Savings!,30287,772,Bank of America,44885,1,"I have banked with BOA for over 20 years and watched fees go up. Now they want $12 a month for basic checking unless I keep $1,500 in it, earning nothing! Too many banks have free checking to put up with this. I have $3600 a month in rent deposits from tenants but they insist I have DIRECT DEPOSIT of $250 from an employer to avoid the monthly fee. That's discrimination against me for being self-employed. Beyond ridiculous. My monthly tenant deposits are 12x this amount! I am moving all my money from BOA. What a sham.",2017-11-04
66,Great Bank,29963,772,Bank of America,44229,5,"Bank of America has always worked with me and made making deposits very simple for me. Even allowed me to overdraft the morning I got paid without charging me fees because I was able to send them a copy of my check before I got to the bank. My bank has stayed late to allow me to get my deposit in and even allowed me to call and make deposits over the phone from my other accounts. I really have had a great experience with this bank. In my business life I deal with lots of other banks and they always seem to cause me problems. However, my bank has always worked to make it so much easier to conduct business.",2017-10-18
67,"The best bank, the second best app",29625,772,Bank of America,43307,5,"Bank of America has a very impressive app, in that it is perfectly functioning in every single one of it's features. Whether it be quickly updating, posting FICO credit score, or receiving and making transactions you can see them all exactly when the app claims. Many companies claim a lot and fail to uphold. So, while this may not be the best mobile banking institution (app or desktop version) as Discover has an amazing site, it is one of the bests and is very intuitive to use. I have paid off credit cards on here, managed multiple accounts well, and received good links, numbers, and suggestions for customer service in one fashion, or another.",2017-09-28
68,Pooor customer service,29548,772,Bank of America,43158,3,I loved this site when you were able to get customer service on their website. However that changed about a year ago. When you call the bank they tell you chat should be working but it never is. Their hold time to get a rep on the phone is extremely long so chat was convenient while they had it . You can put a message on facebook and someone will get back to you however it is not a quick thing so if you need a response right away that is not the avenue to take. If you try to contact them by email they usually take 3 days to respond to you and then just tell you to call to a representative. I am a creature of habit and don't like changing things or I would go look for another bank to help me with my needs,2017-09-23
69,online experience with BOA,29527,772,Bank of America,43117,4,"Generally my on line experience with Bank of America has been very good. The on line format is very easy to use and is good for people who do not have a lot of computer experience. It is not difficult to follow and also the have on line tutorials to guide you. I also like the convenience of using multiple screens to conduct your business faster such as paying bills and transferring money from various accounts. It makes paying bills convenient and easy. I also like the fact that their on line banking is very secure and has redundant security checks. They also provide a credit rating score an report for free so you can secure loans easier. You can also apply for loans on line which is nice to have in a pinch. So basically there system is easy to use for non computer skilled people like myself, very secure and also very affordable and with no physical mail to receive from them which I like a lot because there is no clutter at home with all the mailings. I like the convenience of on line banking also and it is very timely with Bank of America. I am happy with system they provide me and my family.",2017-09-21
70,Bank of America isnt too shabby,29294,772,Bank of America,42498,3,"I have banked with Bank of America for over 10 years only because they were the closest to home. My only CON is when I make deposits, they move all the transactions around so that I end up negative and owe them fees. Reason I stuck with the back is because of the PROS:, cash back deals, user friendly website, banking app where I can deposit checks right from my phone. Unfortunately, the branch closest to me has closed, so I may end up changing banks now.",2017-09-12
71,Very competitive with brick banks,29256,772,Bank of America,42429,5,"Bank of America is a nice place to bank. Their rates are typical of what I find at other banks. They do offer a pretty good checking selection and I've been able to link my checking and savings accounts to make saving a little easier. They have a great online banking system and app for my phone. I really like the app because I'm able to do a lot of my banking without even going to a branch. When I do have to go, the lines aren't very long at the one closest to my work and there are lots of branches so it makes it a little easier. Also, they are connected to an ATM network so I can use ATMs in all sorts of places without having a fee.",2017-09-08
72,Bank of America is a great bank if you dont mind the limits on money markets,29145,772,Bank of America,42255,4,"I have a few accounts with Bank of America and have for many years. I have a money market, savings and a checking account. My checking account I have no complaints with, its very simple to use and the fees are non existent as long as you have a direct deposit tied to it. The savings account works well but the interest rate is so low that its almost pointless. Its basically a tenth of a percent which is unheard of nowadays. The money market has a slightly higher interest rate but there is a limit to transfers from the account, only 5 times a month and then you start incurring a fee. I believe I should be allowed to make a few more transfers but overall im ok with this limit. The app works great for bank of america and I dont have any complaints about it. The ability to deposit checks from the app is amazing and makes me feel like im in the future. Overall Bank of america is a pretty good bank with decent savings and money market accounts, just wish the interest rate was higher.",2017-08-29
73,A trusted bank I've used for many years.,29137,772,Bank of America,42247,4,"I have had a Bank of America account since 1997. I have checking and savings and I must say I am really impressed with their online banking system.<br/>I am constantly ""in"" my app/online banking website, and there are several features I find excellent. I like the ""keep the change"" feature that transfers any cents on a debit card transaction into my savings account. The pennies do add up, and honestly I don't really miss them leaving my checking account.<br/>Another feature I find OUTSTANDING is the online bill pay. I am able to prepay my bills and schedule when I want the money to come out of my account. It doesn't ""pend"" prior to delivery. I made a HUGE mistake in the joint account at Wells Fargo (that I share with my husband) and prepaid some online bills....scheduling them for three days in advance. By doing this I completely bounced the account! I couldn't believe it. That never happens at BOA, I know what is going out and when the money is coming out. It was almost like WF grabbed the money and took it away! I am ready to dump WF. BOA is the way to go for sure.",2017-08-28
74,Bad bank,29119,772,Bank of America,42229,1,"I do not like this bank and it has been a bad experience over the last few years. I got this bank because my family all used Bank of America. It turned out to be a bad idea. I opened an account and I already started getting fees right away. $6 were taken from me every single month and it was money that I needed very much. I went overseas and I was charged every time I used my debit card. The other bank I use now does not do this. Even taking money out at an ATM in Russia was a problem and I had a fee for that. The fee for my account was due to increase to $12 a month. I mean, this bank is good for someone that has a lot of money, but for people starting out, this bank is just a thief that robs you six dollars at a time and has no clue how to handle overseas transactions.",2017-08-26

I finally had to claim bankruptcy to keep the 100K in equity I had in my house. After five years of paying them back the BK was discharged and BofA charged me $50 added to my house payment for reviewing that they had received all of the payments and applied them correctly. Of course the Rules don't allow me to refinance for two years after discharge. But the day the two years are up, I am gone and they will lose my business for life.",2017-08-09

I am a recent enrollee and it was very easy for me to enroll and switch to this bank. Staff at my favorite branch by my school are very friendly and professional. The person I was oriented with explained everything to me and clearly knew what he was talking about, even though he was somewhat similar to me in that he is only a few years out of college. The institution's website and iPhone app are also very straightforward and easy to use. The only thing about those is that I can't always tell what transactions have cleared and which are still pending; this is often confusing for me, in app and online.",2017-08-08
79,Business with Bank of America,28735,772,Bank of America,41292,3,"I've been banking with Bank of America since I was around 17 years old. At this time they offered a student checking along with a student savings. To preface this, I chose Bank of America because this is where my parents were banking. Upon getting my first job, I opened up the student checking and savings. I learned that for these accounts, there were no monthly charges attached. One didn't have to keep a minimum balance in the account, nor did one have to have direct deposit in order to bypass this. Instead it was pretty simple. Fast forward a few months and a few dollars saved, I wanted to take money from my savings, and transfer to my checking. I learned that there was a certain amount of transfers between my accounts per month, or I'd be charged. At this time it wasn't an issue, as it was supposed to be a one time thing. After a few more months, I wasn't making as much, and was needing to transfer money from my accounts. I quickly surpassed my allowed amount, and began to incur monthly charges. I wasn't very fond of this, and eventually moved myself over to TD Bank. Because this isn't about TD Bank, I'll skip the jargon, and simply state that I wasn't happy with them, and moved back to Bank of America. This time I was not a student, and had to open regular type accounts. At first I didn't open a savings, because I knew the limits behind that. After a while, and seeing that I could successfully save, I opened a savings account, and since, have not had any issues with my banking experience.",2017-08-06

In this process, I have been lucky (seriously) to find 2 other quality lenders. Also, during this search process, I have come to realize how good BOA really is when it comes to customer service. I have been a customer for over 35 years, beginning with a local small town bank and several merges to end up with BOA being my bank about 20 years ago. I owe them this review because they really have been exceptional at almost everything I have done with them. Their online and mobile applications are excellent and the ability to talk to a real person is never hard to accomplish. Thanks BOA and please keep up this level of customer service at the top of your priority list always.",2017-07-26
82,Bank of America online banking,28341,772,Bank of America,40188,3,"I must admit, I really did not want an account with Bank of America, but at this point there isn't too much of a choice. I give this bank an overall rating of average at best. Setting up the account was tedious, but I guess they are all the same in that way. My goal is to avoid seeing anyone in a bank and I think that is their goal too. Unfortunately, If you have a problem setting up your account you are left to the internet to figure it out because finding a human is next to impossible. So, customer service is pretty much non existant. Their platform is easy enough to use on your mobile phone or computer, I thought it was good and useful. They have all the necessary personal banking products that one would need. The fees bothered me, there are all sorts of penalties if you do not do things correctly, so be careful with fees and make sure you read the fine print in the contract, because they will find a way to hit you with a charge on any misstep, like an overdraw, wire fees etc.",2017-07-26

Their online banking option and the application option are excellent and very user friendly. It is easy to navigate and achieve what you are trying to achieve.

EDD sends the checks through bank of America and when we went in to cash them we told them about what was going on and they helped us open a new account.

The letter states that there is no recourse, and that no reason for this closure will be given. The folks at the local branch I've dealt with were unable to shed any light on the reasons for this. I've never, ever had any financial problems with my account, which is tied to my 22 year old business with a stellar financial history.

They, also, will send you monthly statements letting you know how much money is in every account you have. The only complaint I have about this bank is that it's monthly fees are kind of high. They take out a monthly fee for every account that you have. Other than that, I've had a great experience with them. If I have any questions or concerns, the customer service team is prompt and attends to the problem right away. I remember one time I had fraudulent activity on my debit card and they cancelled it and notified me right away. The money was also returned to me. Amazing!

87,Never had an issue with BOA,27732,772,Bank of America,38974,4,"I've held my checking and savings account for about 5 years now. Initially, I opened the checking at the bank and the savings online, both of which were extremely simple. In the past I have tried other major institutions, all of which have flaws. Bank of America has given me great customer service, fraud protection at its finest, and great app integration. My only complaint is that in 2016 BOA redesigned their app entirely, though functionality was greatly improved, it was tedious to learn again. Despite this, I am very pleased with my bank, they have had my back on many occasions. A couple years back I was grocery shopping, when I went to check out my card was declined, I was shocked because I had just checked my balance before leaving. I paid with a different card and when I finally sat down I opened my app and saw someone was spending thousands. My balance was hundreds of dollars negative. Bank of America noticed that this is not usual for me and subsequently gave me a call. However, I missed this call and prompted the fraud detection in app. It allowed me to submit every fraudulent transaction and receive my money back quickly. I called the bank back after doing this to find out more information because the scariest part was that I had my card in my hand, it was not stolen from me and I did not lose it. So I asked the woman about the transactions and she told me they were local to me. Scary stuff. Anyway, I appreciate the attention to detail as well. Small things like travel notices, locking your card in case of emergency, ordering a new one with the touch of a button, and most of all the budgeting widget they recently released. I would recommend this bank to anyone reading this.",2017-05-11
88,Be wary of Overdraft services,27730,772,Bank of America,38972,3,I have had an account with Bank of America for about 2 years. I arranged to have one of my utilities deducted automatically from the account. I did not understand fully the overdraft services that Bank of America offers. Several times I have overdrawn due to my funds not being deposited actively til the next day. Every 3 days I found myself getting more into the negative as the overdraft charges occur. The customer service line was not helpful at all in this situation,2017-05-11
89,Bank Of America Steals From Dead Clients,27860,772,Bank of America,37196,1,"It's true--Bank of America steals money from the accounts of deceased clients. It is happening to my father's account right now. He passed away some months ago, with about $7,500 in his Bank of America checking account. In January 2017, I filed all required paperwork (I am his son and the executor of the estate) to have the funds disbursed. Bank of American has never responded. On three occasions, I met with bankers at B of A offices in person. All agreed I had done everything required and the funds should have been disbursed to me long ago. They have always been polite...and they have always made it clear that they will do nothing to help me. It seems they are afraid of repercussions to their jobs and careers if they try to have the funds released. I have heard that this is a Bank of America policy. They know it is not worth the cost to me to sue them for $7,500; besides, they can tie it up in court for years (they have a staff of attorneys, so there is no cost to them). Be warned: If a loved one dies, Bank of America will probably attempt to steal the money in their account, as they are doing to me, and there is nothing you can do about it.",2017-05-06
90,Good customer service and nice checking account offer,27602,772,Bank of America,38742,4,"I decided to get an account with Bank of America because of an advertisement offering free checking. The year was 2012. I was unable to complete the checking account application online, and the application directed me to go to one of the bank locations. Upon arriving, I was told I could indeed get the free checking account with no monthly services fees regardless of the account balance, but that it was conditional. I had to opt into e-statements, with the understanding that if I ever went into the bank to have a teller perform any type of bank service for me, there would be a charge. Since I was having a hard time finding a totally free checking account, and since I like to do many things online anyway, I decided to try it. I was also given access to a free Merrill Lynch brokerage account. I set up the account and have gone in and picked stocks to watch, but have not purchased any. I also tried out a CD account, but soon found out that the interest was so small, it wasn't worth the time. I ended the CD and had to pay a small fee that was larger than the interest earned. That was disappointing, but bad rates on accounts accruing interest were commonplace. It wasn't exactly the banks fault. Overall, I've had a good experience. Once I felt the need to do a chargeback through the bank after a merchant in Shanghai went on Chinese New year after receiving money from me for a purchase. I found out that they were going to be gone for over a month and wouldn't even speak to customers who made orders right before they left. They just left messages. Bank of America reversed the charge in short order. I had plenty of evidence the merchant was ignoring me, and the merchant resolved it on their end and cancelled the order over a month later when they got back, but I am glad Bank of America went ahead and credited the money back to me within 24 hours because it was a large sum. I have had no problems with their customer service.",2017-05-01
91,How I used Bank of America,27277,772,Bank of America,38109,4,"Bank of America is a nice bank to use for everyday banking. I first began using them when I was layed off and my worker's compensation was automatically deposited into a BoA account. I liked them so much that I began to use them for all my banking. They have decent interest rates. There are several branches close to where I live and work, so they are convenient for me. I have had no problems with the people working there. All of them seem nice and helpful. Their website is good enough. Overall, I would recommend them.",2017-04-02
92,Great for online banking and banking on the go!,27129,772,Bank of America,37795,4,"I frequently use Bank of America for banking for my business. Bank of America has been great since we switched over from ""Meta Bank."" The transaction fees are much, much smaller. The online banking system is great and makes life easy on the go. The online sign up is very secure, requiring a password, and often additional security questions. After logging on through a secure system I can easily check my balance, transfer funds, and view statements online without any hassle at all. Bank of America has is a very reputable bank who has high standards for security, yet is very simple and user friendly. Their customer service has been sub-par over the years and the customer service people are not the friendliest. However, if your self reliant and like to check up on your balance and need online control, this is a great bank to use.",2017-03-22

I sat at the bank for almost an hour dealing with this. Sent the form in, called back in 2 days like i was told. They told me they were a 3rd party company that had nothing to do with BofA accounts. I waited another week before calling again for my money. Just to be told something might happen in another 3-5 business days.

One of my bills was saying they didn't receive my payment and thanks to Bank of America I was able to show them exactly how and when they were paid. The customer service person didn't act annoyed that they had to go out of their normal routine to help me either. So many companies will do only what they feel like they absolutely have to do for customers. Sometimes you just feel like a number and a bank balance.

97,Overall good.,26638,772,Bank of America,36665,5,"I like Bank of America's service in overall. They have a relatively fast act on any problems related to fraud and hacking. For instance, I called their customer service after finding out that I lost $500.00 out of blue from my checking account. Their personnel responded me by asking a series of question to identify myself related to my personal information. Then, they figured that the their ATM machine in my town got manipulated by someone who put a card reader on top of the their ATM card reader so that they could scan my card information and was able to create a copy of my debit card. They immediately refunded $500 to my account back and started an investigation on this incident. I was surprised how quick they acted on this type of incident and was happy to be a part of them.",2017-02-16
98,Bank of American Mobile Banking,26124,772,Bank of America,35320,5,"The thing I like about banking with Bank of America is that they have a mobile app available. But this isn't just some crummy app that you don't really use. Instead, I use it for pretty much everything, even making deposits. The app is incredibly easy to navigate which is great because I wouldn't use the app if it weren't. But my favorite thing about it is that I get to deposit my paychecks from pretty much anywhere. I get paper checks from my job, and going to the bank to deposit funds twice a month can be a bit tedious. After all, I don't think anyone enjoys waiting in line at the bank. So when I get a check, I simply log into the app, take a quick photo of each side of the check and choose which account to put it in. The funds are technically added the same business day, though you cannot access them for debit card transactions until the following day. This is especially nice because I have learned that when taking a check into the bank for deposit it takes an extra day for the funds to be added which can be really frustrating. Oh! and did I mention that you can choose to use your fingerprint to login to the account so you don't have to worry about remembering the password? I have at least 50 passwords for various sites so being able to login with the fingerprint is really awesome because it's so easy. I also noticed that earlier this week the app has made it to where you don't have to even login to view your balance. You simply open the app and hit balance. Obviously if you want more information you are going to have to login, but it's nice to be able to access balance information so quickly and easily. I only have a couple small issues with this bank. For one I don't like that every method of depositing money seems to take a different amount of time to post. You depost through the app it posts the same day but isn't available for purchases till the next. You deposit at the atm $300 is available immediately. You deposit with a person at the counter your funds won't post until the following day and won't be available to make purchases until the second day. This can be extremely confusing and it took me at least 6 months before I figured out the various rules. I mean it is my money, so it can get frustrating when you have to wait a day or even two to be able to access that money. My other issue with banking at Bank of America is that the customer service is kind of hit and miss. It seems to be based on who you happen upon. Some customer service reps are great others are awful. In fact when I have had issues with my account I have been known to get one bad customer service rep, hang up and call back, and then get a great customer service rep who is more than happy to help me out. Though even this can be frustrating because once you hang up it take a while of suffering through the automated phone line before you can reach another rep. I will say though, I have had dealing with 3 separate banks and Bank of America is the absolute best.",2017-01-03

It seems these days I don't go into the bank as much as I used to, due to to convenience of mobile banking; however, on the occasion I do go in I am always given quick and friendly service. The real reason I have stayed with Bank of America so long is the online and mobile platforms are easy to use and dependable. I have set up auto billpay for all of our bills and have never had any issues.

I started off with just a savings account, and as time went on that grew into an additional savings account, checking account and mortgage.

101,My Bank of America Experience,25841,772,Bank of America,34691,5,"My review of Bank of America is positive.I would recommend this bank to anyone. First off,banking is simple.If you go inside the branch, sometimes you will see a long line at first,because it is a popular bank. However, the tellers are very fast and friendly,and lines move very fast.The inside lobby is very comfortable with complimentary snacks coffee and such. The mobile banking is easy to follow and understand, not jumbled and confusing. Overall, I like the customer service.

102,Bank of America - Accounts review,25808,772,Bank of America,34606,4,"I have been using Bank of America for over ten years now. I have their savings, checking, and credit card accounts. As for the accounts themselves, as long as you do not overdraft, there are little to no fees associated. Transactions are recorded promptly and can be made easy at ATMs, online, or in person at the bank. Interest earned on savings tends to be low. As in all banks, the major drawback in my opinion is having to deal with automated phone services if there is an issue. Eventually you can talk to an assistant, but it takes some tactful maneuvering to do so. In the case an overdraft does occur, you can sometimes explain the reasoning to a bank worker and they will credit you for it. Also, their fraud protection works well if charges are put on your account from a stolen card. Overall, I would recommend the bank, as it is secure and convenient. Just be responsible in your decisions.",2016-12-11
103,Bank a 'Merica (Go Freedom!),25767,772,Bank of America,34546,3,"I joined Bank of America in 2015. My old bank, Union Bank of California, closed its branch in my town, and the only other option was BOA. I hadn't heard good things about them. Friends reported that they (BOA) were impersonal, over-corporate, and indifferent in their customer service. Most of that has turned out to be untrue. In fact, their customer service has been unusually friendly, considering how awful customer service can be. I had an issue with mobile banking, for example. The woman I spoke to at the BOA service center (phone service) walked me through the problem patiently, even when I didn't have the right language to explain the problem. She explained that a default setting in my account was causing the app feature to not work (it was more complicated than that, but you get the idea), and was able to correct the snafu lickity-split. Then she asked if I was having a nice day and whether I thought the Broncos were going to win the Super Bowl (it was around Super Bowl time). I'm not a big fan of BOA's online banking system. It's fairly bland, and banking options are sometimes difficult to locate in the drop-down menus. I'm also not too keen on how long it takes transfers, especially international transfers, to clear. But I figure you'll get these hitches with any bank you run with, so I don't lose sleep. For a supposedly evil institution, I've been relatively pleased with the service I've received.",2016-12-05

The online banking is wonderful and I can make any necessary transactions within a browser, or their wonderful app, despite me being so far from a branch location. I can deposit checks, transfer money between accounts, and even order a debit card without having to leave my home.

At the time, the customer service was terrible. It look a long time to get through to an actual representative. I remember that I would actually have to hang up and call back a few times. This was due to the automated system being extremely difficult to get through and actually speak to a live person. They also had unreasonable fees. I was charged a $10 fee just to have a checking account. I never received free checks to start out with (like my current bank does) and I would receive overdraft fees all the time. I would receive these fees even when I brought my account to a positive balance the same business day. Of course, customer service would never help in these situations. The only decent thing that I can mention about this bank is their online service. The online website was extremely user friendly and easy to use. However, overall, my experience was terrible.",2016-11-09

I had cash rewards of over $150 on my account and they said once they close the account they keep your rewards money.

110,Ideal Service,24979,772,Bank of America,32864,4,"Every visit to Bank of America starts off with a Specialist greeting. At times I am ushered into the bank with a smile and a welcome. As I fill out my account slip, I do appreciate personnel querying me about any deposits they can make on my behalf so I do not have to wait in line. This bank is the only one I have even received a bottle of water and snacks on a few of my visits. In my recent visit, I loved the novel concept of showing how much the dollar is worth on their flat screen. The bank teller helped me determine how to make my bank needs quickly. I leave this day glad I had visited BOA. I had everything squared away and in a timely manner. Thanks.",2016-09-21
111,Average Banking Experience,24970,772,Bank of America,32852,3,"So I've been with BofA for over 10 years. The main reason being convenience. It's nice that they are all over the country, as I have moved a lot in my life. However, I've seen over the years that fees have gone up for everything. It's annoying that they charge a $35 overdraft fee and are usually unwilling to refund more than one or two a year. They charge fees for not keeping a minimum balance in your account and that has been frustrating. I will say that the online and mobile app are really good and rarely have problems. I'll probably keep using BofA because I'm too lazy to switch, but I would say that it's just an average, money making banking institution.",2016-09-20
112,Monthly Charges are a big issue,24842,772,Bank of America,32521,3,"I had been banking with Bank of America for most of my life.<br/> <br/>For the most part, this has been a positive experience. I would often deposit cheques and money into the account. It would be cleared the same day in 95% of the instances.<br/> <br/>The staff was friendly and courteous. The mobile app was easy to use, and I could access my online banking information.<br/> <br/>Many times I returned from vacation with money left over. I could easily exchange money back into dollars.<br/> <br/>That concludes the positive aspects of the experience.<br/> <br/>The negative aspects began when I received a letter in the mail. It highlighted a change in the banking charges. <br/> <br/>The main change was as follows:<br/> <br/>Currently, I had no month fee's, and I would deposit money periodically. <br/>The new rules stated that I would be charged a minimum fee if I did not meet certain criteria. <br/>The main criteria outlined in the letter was X amount of deposits per month.<br/> <br/>Within the next three months of using the account, I did not meet the minimum deposit amount.<br/> <br/>Resulting in a charge for a change in a rule. <br/> <br/>I was not happy and moved the account to a local credit union. No charges present at the local bank.",2016-09-05
113,Bank of America is My Choice,24735,772,Bank of America,32232,5,"I frequently use Bank of America online and I can honestly say that I am totally satisfied with them overall. The bank recently contacted me to let me know that my bank card may have been compromised and instantly informed me of the situation. They even sent me out a brand new bank card without any hesitation. Also, they have it set up so you can get messages via mobile text or email. You have the choice of how frequent you get these updates and what type of updates you receive. I would definitely recommend this bank to all my family and friends. They truly do show a lot of interest in what the customers want and need.",2016-08-19
114,Too many disadvantages,24040,772,Bank of America,30581,1,"We currently have a banking account with Bank of America. Often I resort to using our our banking accounts and prefer not to deal with BOA as much as possible. Bank of America is great if you need to make transfers between accounts, and for that only. However, if you need any kind of support, help, have any questions, or even need to speak with a customer care rep, this place will have you on your heels of anger. Why do I need to schedule an appointment to walk in this bank, yet not at any other banks? Finally, once you do get to talk to someone they act like they are too busy to handle your needs. Everyone seems like they have more important things to do. If you call for help via phone, they tend to ask too many questions, and refuse to help you without you giving secured information to them over a phone which could easily be open source monitored. Every location I visit, the staff is absolutely rude and over-all they act as if they just don't want my business, hence I try and stay away from here as much as possible.",2016-06-06

I called were the check came from they said that the check is definitely at BOA, so what the hell is going on? Talk with BOA customer service told me to wait until Wednesday between 12am-8am. What??

They have been willing to go above and beyond on multiple occasions. For example, I once made a cash deposit into the wrong account. It was my error but I was able to resolve the issue online in a manner of minutes. The service is truly exceptional. I never am left waiting during online or brick and mortar visits. Overall, I highly recommend this bank. I expect only the best when dealing with my financial security, that is why I choose and stay with Bank of America.

118,Class Action Lawsuit? READ ENTIRE POST/Reply,23911,772,Bank of America,30237,1,"Opened acct w/BOA about 2 yrs ago. Was told with DD NO FEES! No mention of minimum DD. Ok for 1 month shy of 2 yrs. I called to complain about something re another fee. The next month I notice a $12 service fee. I called and was told that there was a fee for any direct deposits under a certain amt. I explained I have NEVER had a fee regardless of DD amount. I was told it's in the ""fine print"" Also, after a conversation with one of the reps, bc I notice transactions posting ""3 days"" after I swiped my card, transactions were coming through. NOW I would check my balance and could see these transactions go through, the same night I swipe (have been going to this convenient store for a couple years - never a problem. When I am down to almost nothing in my account, I use cash until my DD is deposited (like 3 days) I ONLY NOTICE when my acct is that low, the transactions seem to be ""held"" to cause a negative in my account"" SO during that call, the service rep told me how the transactions are put through, I repeated it back to her this way ""so you are telling me that BOA puts through transactions in the ""order"" they see fit""? She said ""YES""!! I also had my DD go in on Fridays, same DD, Friday every other week, nothing changes! It should be there at 12:01 am Friday, OH NO - when ever they want...Well it was 730am Friday, I ran to the convenient store to get a coffee $1.07) (saw my DD was in my account) got home w/coffee to an that I was $1.07 NEGATIVE!!! With this said, you can see they are doing EXACTLY what TD BANK had the Class Action lawsuit against them for! The 2 girls who started the lawsuit WON! If you have experienced this, PL reply back - lets get a lawsuit going and make them STOP THIS!

I ran some tests to see how long it would take to transfer money from my other accounts (at Ally Bank) to BofA.<br/><br/>Initiate transfer at BofA web site: 3 days<br/>Initiate transfer at Ally Bank web site: 2 days<br/>Initiate transfer at Merrill Lynch web site, and then transfer to BofA: 1 day<br/><br/>Note also that BofA charges $3 if you initiate a transfer out of your account from their web site (!!!).<br/><br/>Bottom line: It never makes sense to use BofA's web site to do an ACH transfer. Always use your other bank's site. The fastest way to get money to your account is to use Merrill Lynch's site to transfer from your bank to ML (1 day) and then to transfer from ML to BofA (instantaneous).",2016-03-19

My review here will be limited to online banking for checking and savings accounts and customer service in branch. I find the online banking interface to be intuitive and reliable. I've not ever experienced a problem and can receive assistance there for just about all my banking needs. I do have one issue with the fees which I find a little high. The free checking is only free if you receive a qualifying direct deposit within the calendar month. If not, the fee is $12 which seems a little steep to me. Also if you for any reason need to actually go into the branch for assistance be prepared to wait a while even if you make an appointment. My experience has been that the customer service staff seem put out to help you in person and expressed politely that what I needed assistance with could have been taken care of through online banking. Obviously this was not the case because if it were I would have done it that way. I found that a little troubling. But overall they have been a decent bank to deal with.",2016-02-09
123,Deposit Confusion,23116,772,Bank of America,27950,1,On Saturday at 8:30pm I deposited a check of $200 into my savings account at BOA thru the ATM in my home town. I was told when RE opening my accounts after numerous issues with them from 2012 that $100 clears automatically and the rest would be pending. Fair enough I thought so I made the deposit like my branch teller instructed me to do thru the ATM if it was after business hours. After making the deposit I did a balance in quarry and saw that only $45 was available and the rest was processing. Today (Sunday) I stopped at the ATM to check on what was going on with my account and saw I only had $11.99!! Being the mother of a 9 month old and needing to do shopping I immediately called customer service. At first the women was very confusing and told me 2 diff deposits before she got to the one I had called about and then continued to tell me that of the $200 that $155 was made available to me when it was not. She then had me on hold for over 20 min waiting for a supervisor to give her the ok to credit my account the $$ which I felt was very kind. 10 min later I am told only $50 will be made available and that I would receive the rest on TUESDAY Feb.2nd since they didn't processes checks over the weekend even tho tomorrow is MONDAY and the remaining balance was only $100 if they were crediting my account a measly $50. What the @#$% are they talking about and does any of this sound right???,2016-01-31
124,"Think once, think twice, and think again if you find yourself considering putting your money in here",22544,772,Bank of America,26221,2,"Where to begin... I made one of the worst personal finance decisions of my life when I opened an account here at a wistful 19 years old. Poor young me had no idea what he was in for with this fraudulent, selfish, and irresponsible bank. The experience that caused me to finally leave... after the countless fees and random changes in policy that ended up costing me too much money, was my account being hacked after using an ATM outside of one of the banks own locations. ALL of my funds were stolen in this incident, and it took me over a month for Bank of America to accept responsibility and replace the money in my account. And after they finally got around to that, it took another month, 2 months total, for them to issue me a new debit card. If you like writing $5 checks and being hassled trying to withdraw money in person without an active debit card, I would say go for it. Open an account here. But if you value your money and your sanity, avoid this cursed institution like the plague.",2015-10-22
125,Bank of America Review,22386,772,Bank of America,25793,3,I think Bank of America is an okay bank you certainly could probably find some better alternatives. From my experience they have a decent team of people at any of the branches I've been to with good experience and a good way of helping their customers. They are always quick and friendly to get you back on your way. The fees are kind of bad I get $12 in maintenance fees taken away every month. The app they have and website works well on a variety of platforms and their apps are always getting updates and have gotten easier to use with more intuitive interfaces. Some of the good features that they have is the ability to cash a check through their atm it is a really painless and simple process and now you can also cash checks from your phone. I think they are competitive and provide comparable services to other banks. Savings and checking accounts are easy to manage. Transfers are generally painless although they do take some time. Using their electronic wire transfers works well and I have never had issue with that or setting up direct deposits.,2015-10-03

Problem is I did not receive the offer until day 70. I was encouraged to pursue the bonus even though the deadline had passed. My case was escalated twice before I was denied. Offering a bonus with a 90-day deadline on Day 70 seems rather disingenuous. Colossal waste of my time.,2015-07-14
129,BoA Is Number One,21744,772,Bank of America,24228,4,"Bank of America is my number one bank of choice. I bank with Bank of America for a couple of different reasons. Their customer service is helpful, professional and easy to speak to. Their app is great for when I am on the go and need to check my accounts or make transfers. There is always a Bank of American in any location I travel to. I always recommend Bank of America to friends and family when they ask me who to bank with. When I have a question about banking I can log onto their easy to use website and read through their commonly asked questions forum. Normally, I am able to quickly find my answer and move on to my next task. Their fees are low in comparison to other banks and their website is user friendly.

I have always been able to resolve an issue with the bank within just a few minutes on the phone. I have traveled internationally and never had a problem using my debit card when overseas as long as i informed the bank of my departure before i leave.,2015-07-01
131,A reasonably good experience,21596,772,Bank of America,23974,3,I live in Virginia and this bank is great here. The service is second to none and they have a lot of ATMs. That's why I chose them. BofA is so big that you'll always have an ATM nearby. So that's an added bonus. I really liked the bank.,2015-06-21
132,Better Than I Thought...,21495,772,Bank of America,23837,4,"I have 2 bank accounts. 1 with BofA that I opened when I worked for them in 1999 and last year I opened an account with SunTrust thinking that I may eventually change banks (a real pain in the ass because of BillPay/Automatic BillPay.) and move away from BofA all together. I move money back and forth between the accounts as needed... Mostly to SunTrust since my plan was to eventually make them my only bank. Without fail SunTrust will hold my funds for 3 days before I have full access to them, which has caused me so overdraw a couple of times (at a $35 charge from SunTrust), or had online BillPay refused for insufficient funds, causing me more fees and late fees from those I am trying to pay. Yes, I know that banking laws say that it ""could take up to 3 days"" for funds to move between banks. Using electronic transfer I can push money from BofA to SunTrust or can pull from BofA from SunTrust. It doesn't matter which way I do it, SunTrust doesn't make the funds available for 3 days. HOWEVER, BofA shows the funds as gone the day of the transfer. To get around this I have found that I get faster access to my money (or at least part of it) if I actually write a check to myself from BofA and deposit it into SunTrust. Even with that, SunTrust puts a hold on part of my funds, even though BofA has already sent the funds to SunTrust. How do I know? The electronic image of my check is available online at BofA the very next day. If I do the reverse and move money from SunTrust to BofA, SunTrust does not release the funds for 3 days but BofA (after verifying the funds are there) makes the money available to me same day. What do I pay for this wonderful service? At SunTrust - $7.50/month unless I run 10 transactions through the account. At BofA? $0.00 with no stipulations. Totally FREE checking. <br/><br/>Comparing the Mobile Banking Apps BofA is great at automatically capturing my check images. Good job there!<br/><br/>I used to get really frustrated with BofA but after my experience with SunTrust I will have to say that maybe they are not as bad as I thought. Right now I am going to stick with BofA for the foreseeable future.",2015-06-12

The associate who helped me was amazing and very professional, and she didn't give off the vibe that she just wanted to sell me a credit card.

Both of their standard savings and student checking account are flexible. The fee for withdrawing from the saving account outside the grace period is forgiving. Similar to the overdrawing from a core checking account, they give you a reasonable amount of time before charging the overdrawn fee. Their rates could be a lot more competitive though. Same with the benefits, the cashback rewards are lackluster. However my experience with customer service has been surprisingly positive for all encounters. The representatives are courteous and helpful, cooperate to answer questions and request . Haven't had a bad experience yet.

I first opened it as a college student because of the convenience of having locations both in the city I was currently living in as well as my home state. As a college checking account it offered just about anything you would need as far as services and web/app capabilities. They were also pretty good about waiving the occasional overdraft fee when needed. But since I was converted to a regular checking account it has been near impossible to avoid fee's. $10 ""Overdraft Protection"" fee if my checking runs out and money is need to be pulled from my savings account. Another $3 to transfer money to MY account at another bank. And my interactions with customer service have been less then acceptable, both within branches and over the phone. To be honest the only reason I haven't switched to a local credit union is the mere fact that I am too lazy to change all my auto drafts. I'm guessing that will soon change.",2015-03-29

The time when we went to the bank to open an account, the person who took care of us was very helpfull and nice, to point that we haven't had any need to go back or call for information. Even when we went abroad, and in some store, they charged us three times the same amount, the Bank locked our account, as a measure of security. We liked that. And when we called the Bank, because our card was blocked, they were very helpfull giving us assitance. We like their on line programs too, very easy to access and to use.

The mobile app is amazing to have! you can even deposit your checks on there but in my experience personal checks are a bit harder to get through on there.,2015-03-24
145,Worst Bank Ever,20517,772,Bank of America,22400,1,"This bank is by far the worst big bank I have EVER done business. They are so money hungry they charge you for every little unreasonable thing, and I'm not just talking about OD fees (I opted out of those and use my account wisely). If you are an unhappy customer, they dont care about anything you have to say. They'll just close your account and not even ask why you're unhappy. ONLY ONE EXAMPLE: I had missed two CC payments on ANOTHER CC UNRELATED to BOA (while I made sure to make BOA CC payments on time and more than minimum) and the CC department decided to take the liberty and lower my CC limit based on the two other late payments. WTH??? If I'm current with you and you are getting what is owed to YOU, what difference does it make? When I went in to close both my bank account and my credit card (like I needed the extra ""burden"" of another card) they didn't even bother to ask me why I wanted to close my account to try to keep my business. Maybe had they done so, it would have calmed me down and I would have stayed with them. The fact that they did not do so just goes to show that they have poor customer service and dont care a bit about the customer. My payment history on ALL of my cards, bills and payment schedules are all current, on time and never late, so the ONE time I was having financial problems with ANOTHER institution (nothing to do with BOA) they decided to cut my limit. I have plenty of ""good credit"" cards that I didnt need another one...the only reason I got this one was because it was a promo offer and for a separate business account that I hadn't used for business in awhile anyway, so it's not like it hurt me one bit to close that account. They only stabbed themselves in the foot and now will not see another hard, earned penny of mine go into their institution. <br/><br/>My advice? Shop around.

147,The best big bank I've had business with!,20439,772,Bank of America,22305,4,"I've held accounts with many different banks over the years - Wells Fargo, Chase, Community, Bank of Texas, various credit unions... I've had the best experience with Bank of America so far! I've had an account with Bank of America for about a year now and I am very pleased with their customer service, both in my local branch and also over the phone and chat. The last time I had an issue regarding an overdraft fee a few weeks ago, I promptly spoke to an agent through the online chat. The agent was able to resolve my issue and was able to waive the fee for me! For people saying they have bad customer service experience with BOFA (or banks in general), part of it can be the way you approach the issue with the agent. If you start out rude and angry the agent may not feel like helping you to the best of his or her ability. Just a thought! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>Anyways, I'm happy with BOFA and I will stay a loyal customer.",2015-03-04
148,Mostly satisfied,20305,772,Bank of America,22177,5,"As far as the services themselves, I love Bank of America. Transfers and deposits happen quickly, and Iâ€™m not dissatisfied with the amount of fees when they do happen. I like that their website has a chat function so I donâ€™t have to call or go into a branch every time I need to talk to someone. If I have to go into a bank branch or get an issue resolved that's unusual, I tend to be a little let down. As polite as they are, they tend to speak with confidence about things they don't know about, and others will be somewhat rude and callous when you come in expecting something based on what you've been told. However, they've refunded a good amount of fees and are generally very reasonable.",2015-03-01

For personal things, it's fine. They don't really gouge you with fees, but I would not suggest business banking with them unless you are a larger company. <br/> <br/>If you are a smaller company, or a just starting out, look somewhere else. You'll lose a good bit of money to the fees they charge and if you're bootstrapping, you probably can't afford to do that. It all adds up pretty quick.",2015-02-25

I originally opened up an account with them because I liked the interest rates they had on their savings accounts, but then decided to open checking with a debit card along with those others loans and credit cards. Their customer service is superb. Every time I have had to call to ask a question, I always talk to an American who has a clear view of my account and knows exactly how to solve whatever problem I am having.

My brother's small bank in which only has two offices offers this but BoA, which is one of the largest won't. I can't get this money without it so will be opening a new account in another bank as BoA is too stupid to keep a simple service like this for their customers. I've had this account for 20+ years but this means closing my account. It will take me months to get my direct deposits and new checks, etc (which means months before I can complete the needed paperwork) settled elsewhere when one simple stamp which takes no time at all would have kept them a customer.<br/><br/> Also try and negotiate through BoA website in order to find a way to contact them.

He would not answer my emails regarding what I should list as an account number for the check that Charles Schwab would write to rollover my retirement funds. When I went to him in person he was not helpful either. It felt like he was answering my questions, but really wasn't answering them. However, he did submit the necessary paperwork to Charles Schwab to initiate the transfer. One day I received a call from Charles Schwab that they couldn't accept third party paperwork. So I went to Bank America again to ask for an account number. Luckily, the previous Financial Advisor was moved to a different location. The new advisor was able to answer my questions and give me the information I needed, which was the account number. As a result of the delay in receiving the account number Charles Schwab did a force pay out of my retirement funds without my knowledge and the check was already mailed to me. I only found out about the check because the new Financial Advisor was able to give me the necessary information and I called Charles Schwab to update them. When I received the check taxes were taken out, which was different from the usual direct rollovers. As a result, I had to open an IRA account that reflected this or I would be taxed again. I even had to add back into the Bank of America IRA account the taxes that was taken out of the Charles Schwab retirement funds. With the help of the new Financial Advisor I was able to get this stressful nightmare over with. Even though this process was a nightmare the customer service that was given to me by the second advisor improved my overall view of this bank.",2015-02-02

I was given the student account when I first applied, and it gave me no fees or anything so that was a really nice perk. Once that expired I was given a regular checking account, no problem. I then switched to an online-only account which is far better in my opinion. I do all of my banking online, on my phone app or on my laptop. Depositing checks is incredibly easy. The only downside to this is if I have to, for whatever reason, speak to an actual teller, I will get charged a fee because it wasn't 'online' specific. If someone were to wire me money or something, I'd get a fee for that if it went through an actual person. The fees aren't too high, but I still think that's a bit unreasonable.

They lured me in after graduating from high school and after the barrage of the typical letters in the mail you get from banks you get as a vulnerable high school grad, I decided to go with BoA. Obviously I wanted a cool and trendy bank, and of course Bank of America fits that in all honesty. Everybody has BoA and knows about BoA. However, I did not know that you pretty much had to be a well-off individual to ENJOY Bank of America... You will get fee'd for something as silly as maintaining a small balance on your account and you will continue to get fee'd until you bring your balance up over these made up thresholds. It's incredible. Also, don't even think about overdrafting, you get fee'd daily if your balance is negative. Sure they have an appealing website, mobile app, and locations everywhere. But unless you have a big balance, you will get drowned in these ""convenience"" fees. There's nothing convenient about being fee'd all of the time!",2015-01-27

158,Wonderful BofA Branch Experience,19808,772,Bank of America,21529,4,"I visited a branch of Bank of America in Texas a couple of times to establish new accounts for checking, savings and a credit card. I was extremely pleased with the way they handled my situation and the pleasant attitude of the bank personnel I worked with. Both times I visited the branch without making an appointment to see a banker. While there, I only spent about 10 minutes waiting to be seen. During that time I was was given water and was given updates that it would only be a few minutes more. The first visit to open the accounts took only about 30 minutes and I was given all the information I needed to make a decision easily regarding the specific type of accounts I wanted to open. The banker answered many questions while entering my information. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>The second visit was due to an issue with the email address associated with the accounts which I discovered after registering with the bank's website. The email address needed to be linked to a couple of the new accounts but not to the third. I could not find where this type of change could be made on the bank's website and after calling the bank's support line they directed me to visit the branch once more - so I did. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>This second visit was just as pleasant as the first visit. After I explained the issue to the banker, it was taken care of within just a couple of minutes. The banker explained that since the update was made at the branch, it was immediate whereas an update via the bank's website would take somewhat more time. The banker also provided some examples of how she used online bill pay to avoid using checks and receiving paper statements which I thought was very helpful.",2015-01-24

I have been getting $12 per month fees for checking, and $5+ per month for savings. $17 in fees is ridiculous, and I get more fees thrown on if I transfer too much money or use my debit card too often, and I think I have been charged for using an ATM more than 3 times. What is that about! It is MY money, I should be able to transfer and use my money as often as I please. <br/> <br/>Their mobile and online banking is pretty good- you can deposit checks from your phone by taking a picture of the checks.

I have found the ATMs to be located in shopping malls, airports, random street corners, parking lots and various other places. There are quite a few within walking distance of my workplace as well. Their rates have never really been too competitive. The savings account interest rate is pretty much nonexistent. Recently they added a minimum balance of $1500 for my checking account which is very manageable, but I find it annoying to have to constantly keep my eye on it. The few times I have had to step in a branch to do transactions or get service on my account have been very productive. Their branch employees are well trained and professional.",2015-01-05

170,Lots of fees,18664,772,Bank of America,20083,2,"Bank of America has many ATMs which is convenient and has local branches available throughout the country which allows me to do banking even when I am travelling. Since I tend to travel quite a bit for work as well as pleasure, access becomes a problem with many of the smaller banks. This is generally not a problem for BoA. <br/> <br/>Bank of America charges fees for everything however. If I happen to be somewhere where there is not a local ATM, use of another ATM results in several dollars in fees for each transaction. Credit card fees are high. Overdraft protection is available and you can link a credit card to your checking account to prevent overdraft fees. Unfortunately, if you use the overdraft protection you are charged a significant fee. If there were 2 pending transactions in your account they will transfer money to cover the first and charge a fee then transfer money to cover the second and charge another fee. <br/> <br/>They allow mobile deposit now which is a wonderful convenience, but it takes several banking days for funds to be available. Getting an ""acceptable"" picture of a check can be challenging but otherwise the mobile deposit process is easy. Unfortunately funds are delayed in getting to my account. For my last deposit, that meant funds were not available for 6 calendar days and my account was then ""overdrawn"" when my bills were paid despite the fact that I had deposited over $2000. I was then charged overdraft fees for the account and over draft coverage fees for each transaction. This means that near the end of the month when my mortgage is due, I need to drive to the bank to deposit my check instead of using the mobile deposit feature. This defeats the purpose of mobile deposit. <br/> <br/>The mobile site and website are fairly user friendly but are down often, especially in the evenings when many people are available to bank. Online bill pay was easy to set up and consistently pays my bills on time.",2014-10-29

I cannot count how many times I've gotten charged an overdraft fee for my account overdrafting even if I put money in my account that same day to save my account. According to them one doesn't get charged an overdraft fee until all charges are cleared and not pending anymore but I find that is not the case at all with them. I've put money in my account while charges were still pending and have still been charged fees. I also notice they will charge several overdraft fees back to back for different charges unlike most banks who charge one overdraft fee altogether just for overdrafting period. The only reason I've even been with them so long is because I've grown so used to being with them that I don't want to go through the hassle of switching all of my information over to another bank as far as my direct deposits and bills.",2014-10-29

Secondly, if I want to change my credit card, etc, I will call or set up an appointment. I find this encounter in such POOR TASTE.

What I couldn't understand were the fees for every minute thing, and most of the fees were ambushes; meaning, you weren't warned before hand by the agents whom displayed such awesome customer service. This is a red flag to me. If you're smiling, I assume that you're trustworthy. But in the end it just seems like they're good at creating friendly environments for profit. There was no other bank that took $8 per month out of my account. This was for ""maintenance fees"" as they say, but I wasn't made aware of this. Then, there was a document that I read that said this fee would be removed whenever there wasn't at least 125 in my account. This wasn't made aware to me. After looking through documents of my own free will, and not after being recommended to do so, i discovered this. The bank has set a fee for just about every service that a you could think of, and in most cases wouldn't be a charge at another bank. My suggestion is go elsewhere if you want a bank that will HOLD your money, and not extort you legally, through contracts and misunderstanding. The banks name should be changed, as it gives the country a bad name.",2014-10-16

180,An Average Bank,18370,772,Bank of America,19734,4,"I've had a checking account with this bank for over five years now and I'm reasonably happy with the experience. I have heard of others having negative experiences with BOA, but those had to do with aspects of their business which I have no experience with. Speaking as someone who isn't looking for anything fancy in a bank I have no reason not to recommend them. The only minor thing I can say is that their online system sometimes wouldn't work for me and it was difficult to reset the password, but this was rare.",2014-10-11
181,Not Too Bad,18324,772,Bank of America,19674,4,I've been with Bank of America for about 7 years now. I enjoy their mobile app and especially their keep the change program.

182,Great for what I need,18233,772,Bank of America,19548,4,"Bank of America was my first bank and it is a bank that I have stuck with throughout the years. When I first signed up, it was painless to set up their e-banking account so that I can access my bank account online from anywhere. They consistently release new features, such as a smartphone app that allows you to directly deposit checks using your phone's camera. <br/> <br/>The only bad thing that I could say about Bank of America is that there are some fees that are questionable. For example, I was under the impression that if I had to use a brick-and-mortar sites' services, I would be charged $8.00 or so (I was told this around 2010, I'm not sure if the policy has changed since then). This is a bit limiting, but since I never go the actual site, it is not an issue for me.",2014-10-03

184,reliable but overrated,18226,772,Bank of America,19541,3,"I have been with bank of america for a long time. Although it serves its function as a bank pretty well, there are times when the bank will impose absurd random fees. The good part is that if you call them up, they will waive the fee.

Any time I need to call in, aside from a bit of wait time, they're always courteous and professional. When I have to go into the actual bank, they're always nice as well.

The Bank of America mobile app is easy to use and great. I've deposited money, moved money around in my account, and even applied for different banking needs all from my phone.

Their online banking and mobile applications are one of the best in the industry and very secured. I like the way they secure customer personal information and identity. They are in the industry for ages and they are one of the oldest bank in the USA history. They are very reputed for their excellent customer service. Though their fees are reasonably high I would still go with my back for their excellent customer service and their competitive products. Overall I can give my rating as excellent and I would always recommend my bank to my friends and relatives.,2014-09-14

When I visited the bank for the first time it was not with the intent of opening an account, I had accompanied a friend who was opening an account with the bank. The customer service was so high in quality at the bank that I decided to open an account as well. Since that day, 10 years ago, I have held an open checking account with Bank of America and recommended it to all my friends that were seeking to set up checking or savings accounts. I feel Bank of America has always went above and beyond the necessary requirements to insure any issue I have had with my account was resolved in a manner most beneficial to me, including the waiving of fees in more than one situation.",2014-09-14

I have been a customer since Boatman's bank which turned into Nations Bank finally into Bank of America. They make up the rules now as they go. I made a payment to one of my bills which should take a full day to process and then it will go in the next day. Nope, they charged me 35 bucks with the 24 hour rule. Never had this problem before and the people on the phone who can't speak English tell me...""no it's always been that way""...after explaining to them that I know better. Excuse after excuse and they don't even listen to you. Another time I made a car payment that was suppose to go through the following Monday...after I made the payment on the previous Thursday!

In my experience I have come across a few impolite and rude workers, this could be due to location. <br/> <br/>Bank of America has a great web/mobile site that I trust. I trust its security more than some of the other banks like Farmer's Bank. <br/> <br/>This bank worked with me to get me the best checking and when I was struggling at first to stay in the black they put limits so that I couldn't overdraw. Not all banks do that.",2014-09-08

I closed out an account with Bank of America and withdrew all of the money from the account, however the bank waited to close the account and charged me an insufficient funds fee. I do not think this should be legal, this bank is full of crooks and no one should ever use them, but the government will just keep giving them money so that they can continue to abuse us. When I called customer service to figure out what was going on the person was quite rude and blamed me for their fraudulent actions, its like they are trained to never take responsibility for their actions.",2014-09-05
197,Bank of America - America's Bank,17784,772,Bank of America,18894,4,"I have found Bank of America to be a very convenient bank with the number of locations, and ATMs. Bank of America does have good fraud detection is willing to work through any issues that come up. Recently I had an issue and Bank of America was very helpful in reversing fraudulent charges and not assuming I was part of the problem. The issue with Bank of America is it is a large bank so you will never get the community bank feel. Their products aren't flexible and not really made for the communities they necessarily work within.",2014-09-02
198,A solid bank,17783,772,Bank of America,18893,4,"I have been a customer with BoA for about five years now. They were my first bank and were very kind and knowledgeable when setting up my initial accounts. Since then, I have used their customer services occasionally to deal with any problems or questions; they were always professional, courteous, and extremely helpful. They are not a perfect bank however. They do charge a fee if your account is overdrawn, even if there is more than enough funds in another account. Their credit card 'deals' are not the best and can be hard to decipher the actual package you're signing up for. Finally, their politics are not the most flavorful: they're a large, corporate organization that will do pretty much anything to stay in the black. But what corporation isn't? This is a good starter bank, but I will be switching to a credit union in the near future.",2014-09-02
199,BOA Review,17697,772,Bank of America,18742,3,"Overall, my experiences with BOA have been quite poor. They are good in the fact that they provide many services, but are poor in a lot of aspects. They have many hidden charges that they do not really tell you about nor provide ample warning about. This makes it so you need to put more effort into doing your banking to ensure things are all good.

202,Bank of America falls short on customer service,17451,772,Bank of America,18303,4,"Bank of America can compete with any bank when it comes to technology, products and competitive rates. Their mobile banking is easy to use and they have multiple offices that make banking convenient. That being said they also charge convenience fees for actually using their branch locations too much. When calling their 800 number I encounter long wait times and I'm often give different answers from each customer service rep when asked the same question. From my experience their customer service reps have been less than friendly and I feel more like a bother than a customer. Overall the technology wins my service since I don't require much personal interaction with Bank of America employees.",2014-08-07

Their touch-screen ATM software is awesome, and the machines always read my checks. No matter where I move to in the U.S. there is always a BofA branch/ATM nearby. Their web site is well designed and informative as well. My only complaint are the fees for over-drafts and such, but typically one can resolve their issues with BofA by going in and talking to someone at a branch and explaining the issue.",2014-08-06

I wanted a private local credit union, but I couldn't get accepted until I had lived here at least three months. So I was off for three months with BoA. At first they seemed okay, but I got monthly fees that I did not like, and they took off some fees for god knows what. Their customer service was okay, but the biggest thing I hated was how they took my money and never mentioned it. You won't earn anything being at this bank, all they will do is rob you blind. Go somewhere else, if you have to bank here, make sure it's for a small amount of time or else they will steal everything you have. Be safe about Bank of America.",2014-07-30

There were a few times I mistakenly overdrew my account and I called and they were really nice as a courtesy to remove overdraft charges. That lets me know they go above and beyond the call of duty and truly appreciate my service. The customer service both in the branch and on the phone has always been cordial as well.

I recently lost my job and every dollar counts. The twelve dollar a month ""service charge"" is my food for a week. This rule upsets me very much. Unfortunately there is not much I can do because my new job direct deposits my money into that account. Oh well. I guess will keep banking with them.",2014-07-28

Care About Customers,17266,772,Bank of America,17966,1,"Yes, Bank of America may be one of the largest in the world, but that does not give it the excuse to be terrible to its customers. Matter of fact, if it wants to retain this reputation and position, it should be one of the best in terms of service. This wasn't my experience at all. Not only does Bank of America have terrible rates, it's employees just do not care. For them, just working there is enough; the customer does nothing for them. Even when I decided to cut off my services, the employee's last words to me were, ""You'll be back."" Really? How arrogant.",2014-07-21

There's only one time I can count that ive had an issue with them. Once I had acidentally over drafted my account by $7. A few days later they charged me $39.99. That same week they charged me 2 more $39.99 fees. They did remove 2 of them leaving me with only $47 having to pay them. They were able to fix my account in one phone call. Overall banking with them has been great. My direct deposit from my job is in the bank before most of my co-workers. That in itself is very nice.,2014-06-19

Every other bank that I've been with before has processed one overdraft payment and then put a block on the card, but with this bank I was allowed to run up over $200 in fees, not counting what I owed just for the overdrafts themselves, before I found out that I had no money.",2014-06-19

They have pretty good customer service and have many different products available to every customer. They are located everywhere and usually can offer the same level of service throughout all their locations. They hold my mortgage on my house and they have always been fair with rates and they don't nickel and dime me for little charges on my checking and savings accounts.

220,My First Bank,16789,772,Bank of America,17094,3,"Honestly, you are lucky if you understand banks when you open your first bank account at the age of 16. What I did like was that Bank of America was one of the few banks that let you open it at that age. I ended up learning a lot on how bank works and how you shouldn't just sign up for all their programs. I can't review every single program, but the one I disliked the most was Overdraft protection. It's supposed to help you not overdraft but all it is a program that charges you a fee to cover money checking into saving & also will let you overdraft and charge you two fees instead of one.",2014-06-03
221,Very friendly,16788,772,Bank of America,17093,4,My working relationship with Bank of America has been extremely good! I needed an account to direct deposit my SSI check and they opened it for me when two other banks turned me down. First off I had problems with getting online banking started so I went into the bank and they was very helpful and had the online banking going for me in a short time. Also I keep a low balance because of my fixed income and when they charge their fee for this it will run my account negative. They have never charged an overdraft fee for this! It has just been a wonderful experience in every way with this bank! Customer service is fantastic!! I would recommend them to everyone!,2014-06-03
222,Great Service and Web Experience,16721,772,Bank of America,16987,4,"I was recommended to Bank of America by a friend of mine that banks there also.

223,B of A Review,16638,772,Bank of America,16852,3,"I have been a customer of Bank of America since I got my very first job when I was seven years old. Initially, I signed up for an account at Bank of America because of convenience--it allowed easy transfer of money from my father's own B of A account and there was a location only a couple blocks away from my house. Recently however, I have come to appreciate B of A all the more because of the protections offered from identity theft, something I recently became a victim of. Overall, I am happy with my bank!",2014-05-17
224,BOA,16637,772,Bank of America,16851,4,"I've been using Bank Of America (BOA) since I was about 13 years old, as it's one of the more plentiful banks here in my area. I signed up for a student checking account at that time and had a savings account along with it. A few months into using my account, I had went over the limit on my checking account after buying something at a store. The next day, I found multiple $35 fee charges to my account due to insufficient funds. <br/> <br/>On the bright side, I got my first CC from BOA back in December of 2012 with a $300 limit. I had gotten a secured CC as I lacked a credit history and, a year later, I was given the standard card. After calling customer service, I had the card upgraded to their 3-2-1 rewards card and my CL was increased substantially to 2,000. <br/> <br/>I'd say as long as you have a steady flow of income going into your account, your experience with BOA will be a good one.",2014-05-17
225,Average At Best,15857,772,Bank of America,15481,3,"I was forced to open a checking account by a previous employer. He would not deposit my check directly if I banked elsewhere because he would have to pay a fee. That should have told me there all I needed to know about Bank of America, but I acquiesced for his sake. When I quit him, I decided it was easier to keep the account and bank locally. In that time, I watched my account be charged for balance transfers at an exorbitant rate, charged a service fee when I didn't have two direct deposits made in the month that I was transitioning between jobs and other small fees here and there. Additionally, there was never a sense of friendliness or care on behalf of the employees. The convenience factor of the ATMs was the only reason I continued to keep the account, and in time, I decided to just close it all together. Apparently, others did the same because now B of A is no longer even located in that building and I believe no longer in that city except for an ATM. I will never use them again, and I am sure they could care less, but do yourself a favor and use a local bank where they at least feign care because they truly need your business.",2014-01-02
226,Totally Incompetent,15784,772,Bank of America,15340,1,"First, I have no problem with my local bank, other than that they are severely understaffed. My gripe is with the mortgage department in some invisible place where you can never speak to the same person twice. This started in July when I received a letter asking for verification of homeowner's insurance. If I had none, they would begin charging me about $2400 for coverage (about triple what I actually do pay) I promptly mailed all the information to the designated location. A month later, I received the same letter. After calling them, they said they never got the information. I then FAXED it to them. A month later, another letter! I gave them my agent's name and number for them to call for the info, which he did. A month later, the same letter! Again a call to another person and again a call to the agent. This week I received a letter telling me when they would start charging my account for the insurance. Aaaarggghhhh! This time I brought the insurance info to my local BOA branch and they FAXED it. I am now awaiting confirmation that they received it and the nightmare ends. Oh, until July when the cycle will start again.<br/>At best, they are totally incompetent. At worst, they do whatever they can to collect insurance money at grossly inflated rates.<br/>We have four accounts in the bank and despite all the inconvenience of switching to another institution, we are thisclose to doing so!",2013-12-18

So I decided to put this behind me and I kept calling today, 8-12-2013, to handle it myself.  I had to call 6x to get to a USA call center and I was on hold with Tampa, FL, call center and spoke to a gentleman who said he was a supervisor of customer service and said he would check into it.  He said he could see that it had been mailed out 8-8-2013, but needed to make sure it had been done?????  That the note had just been placed on my account at 2:03pm, EST, if it said it was mailed, why does he need to check to see if it has?????????  He placed me on hold.... I am still on hold... lol He came back, said he was actually talking to someone in Tempe, AZ, to find out they are sending out the additional gift card, it just took almost 4 hours to handle everything... at a certain point, it's the principle of the thing... the Supv. in Tampa, FL... did his job... thank goodness...<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> Sherri<br/><br/>  ",2013-08-12

238,"Greedy Corporate Bank With Poor Customer Service, Focused On Profit Margins Not Their Customers",11574,772,Bank of America,10795,1,"I understand how difficult customer service and banking can be. In my industry, I have lots of experience working with banks and various other service industries. However, I have never, in my life, hung up on any customer service folk. At Bank of America (BofA), I've hung up on 3. Let me summarize my worst 3 experiences with this bank.<br/><br/> 1) In 2010, I went to dinner at a Sushi Restaurant. When putting in my tip, the restaurant accidentally inputted too many numbers into the credit card till, and instead of a $45 transaction, my bill was a $45,908.54 transaction. BofA CLEARED this transaction and then spent over a week to reverse the money. At age 23, I did not have anywhere near this amount of money in my account and so I incurred, without doubt, a number of overdraft fees (this was before I finally realized a $45K+ transaction had cleared). Since it took them over a week to reverse the transaction, I was without money for a week. Furthermore, when I had called Customer Service to disput this transaction, the man on the phone asked me if I was trying to buy the restaurant. This was a serious question. Next, instead of reversing all of my overdraft fees, he only reversed half of them. I am not quite sure what his logic was here.<br/><br/> 2) Recently, I had to write a few post-dated checks for a house rental. The rental company had deposited them all at once -- something they've done for the past few years. Every other bank would hold onto the checks and deposit the check according to the date listed. BofA cashed all checks immediately, and then started ringing in the overdraft fees. I called them again to disput this. The lady on the phone told me that BofA has no policy to cash checks according to the date listed on the check. In fact, if the check was post dated 6 months (or similarly, 3 years old or dateless), BofA would STILL clear the check. This hardly seems like a good security measure for your bank to have. Let alone a bank as big as BofA. In this instance, while the post-dated check clearing annoyed me, what upset me the most was how the customer service rep handled the issue. In summary, she had basically told me that: this wasn't her problem, it wasn't the bank's problem, and it was my problem to figure out. In fact, I believe she asked me the very question ""well, what do you want me to do? There's no way I'm reversing the overdraft fees and there's nothing else to do.""<br/><br/> 3) BofA likes flagging the most random transactions on your account as ""fraud"" and putting a freeze on your account without warning. One or two random freezes without warning, I can understand. The bank is just trying to protect your account and is freezing your card for security measures. However, it gets extremely frustrating and annoying when this happens 4, 5, 6 times... and all, again, without warning. No email or phone call until the next day. By then, you are already aware your account has been freezed, because you were at dinner or out grocery shopping and your card was (embarassingly) declined, and you have no idea why.<br/><br/> For these reasons, as soon as I can, I will be switching banks to one that cares about their customers before their shareholders. A company that puts their shareholders and board members before the core of their business (their customers) will, inevitably, fail, and I hope the rest of America will see this soon.",2012-11-27

They accidently closed one of my 15K credit cards...twice. So they asked me twice to reapply for the card which would ding my credit. All 6 customer service reps were surprising rude considering they were the ones who made the mistake and kept blaming the other for it. No accountabilty but then what did we really expect for BofA?

259,Worst Bank Ever,8808,772,Bank of America,661,1,"I went to Mexico to get some dental work done and ended up being cheated. The dentist, Montano, at BioDental Studio quoted me $130 and charged me $570 for sedation. Then, while I was sedated, he drilled 10 of my teeth without even a consultation with me on a treatment plan. When I complained to B of A, they told me that I had to get an expert opinion, which I did. About a week after filing my dispute, I get a call from B of A stating that they can not ask for money back on quality of work rendered in a foreign country. Why didn't they tell me that before I went to the trouble and expense of getting an expert opinion from another dentist? Instead, I receive a letter telling me that after all, merchants have a right to get paid for services rendered. That's like adding insult to injury, which really made me mad. Never mind, that this bank is not there when you need them, but to have the galls to tell me that I should understand that after all, merchants have a right to get paid for services rendered. Are you crazy, not for purposely bilking the client from $130 quote to $570 and not for drilling my teeth without my permission. The worst part is, the fillings were done so poorly that they trap food between my teeth causing more cavities. I initially went there to get an implant, now I need two more. Four of the fillings that Montano put in have already fallen out leaving huge holes, where I use to only have sensitivity. The first implant was charged to my Chase Freedom card. When I told Chase what happened, Chase went into action. They were extremely supportive and even when I was a few days late gathering all the information from the expert witness, within one week of filing my claim, my money including transaction fee was placed back into my account and when the merchant did not respond after two billing cycles, the case was closed with all the money returned to me.

Two events recently have made me decide to take my accounts elsewhere ... <br/> <br/>The first time was when the bank erroneously charged me a service fee for three months running that caused an NSF (they had, for three months running told me that the fee would be refunded - it hadn't). The NSF was partly my fault - I had missed accounting for one direct debit. However, instead of charging me an NSF fee for the direct debit, they honored the DD, which hit the account after four small transactions, and hit me with NSF fees on the four smaller transactions. When we questioned this, the customer service rep spoke to us as if we were worthless deadbeats (I hadn't had an NSF in the previous 25 years). <br/> <br/>They have just done exactly the same thing again. My bad for the one NSF. Their bad for deliberately turning it into four fees. I've just scheduled all my bills to be paid Monday, and will be closing my account on Tuesday.

264,BOA = Bend Over America,8524,772,Bank of America,7084,1,"BOA is one of the biggest crooks on the planet and any scheme they come up with should be looked at with great scrutiny and a great deal of skepticism. These greedy creeps participated in the biggest mortgage scheme of the century that helped to put us into an economic and housing crisis that will last for at least a decade. Yet, as any of you have ever tried to get a mortgage from them lately know, they now treat their customers and potential customers as if THEY were the crooks! We are trying to get a mortgage and have credit scores of over 800, own a home that is paid off, have solid work histories for over 30 years, pay off our credit card in full each month and only have a car payment each month. We've never filed bankruptcy or had a judgment against us. We collect rent on our paid off home and are in the process of buying another home in Florida. We put down 25% as the down payment and the Loan-to-Value ratio is only 75%. But BOA is treating us like we are trying to rob them of the $135K instead of borrowing it. Each day I awaken to another litany of unreasonable and often silly demands for documentation that proves nothing more than the documentation they already have which includes 3 years of tax returns and letters of explanation for just about every deposit into our checking account that is over $1,000 for the past 3 months. We're supposed to close on our new house in a few days and they still have not given us final approval for the loan. The stress has been incredible. IF THERE IS EVER AN INDUSTRY IN NEED OF REGULATING IT IS THE BANKING INDUSTRY. But we'll never see it in our lifetime and there is very little people in the 99% can do about it. The bank that was too big to fail took taxpayer money to save it, paid out millions in bonuses to their executives and is doing nothing to help get us out of this mess that they helped to create.....unless, of course, it is a plan that benefits them first and foremost.",2012-03-25
265,My Account Was In Overdraft For Months...Yet Somehow My Direct Deposited Check Was Going There Weekly,8410,772,Bank of America,6860,1,"I had a BOA account that i opened when I was 18, everything was fine for a year until I got a job with direct deposit. After having my payeoll check on direct deposit for 5 months I get a letter one day from a creditor saying that I owed BOA $135. I took my lunch break and went to the branch across from my job, the people inside the bank had no idea what the letter was and told me to call the number to customer service. I contacted customers service and after various ""dropped calls"" I finally got a person who was willing to answer my questions, I had never been direspected so bad by a customer service agent in my life. The guy on the phone told me that my account had been in overdraft since November, at this time it was early February, I asked him how that was possible when my check had been on weekely direct deposit since September and on top of that I actively use my ATM card to make purchases. He tells me it just was so i asked him if that was the case why didnt they inform me before they sent the account to a creditor. The guy goes on to tell me how it is not his fault that I am an irresponsible individual and so forth and so on. After I tell him that I am trying to figure out how this overdraft was possible and why they didnt inform me if this had happened he tells me I ""don't have to be a bitch about my bad financial intelligence."" Of course by this time I am beyond mad and late back to lunch. I had been disrespected and I now have this stupid charge on my credit and of course when I asked to transfer to to someone above him the call was ""lost."" Eventually I called back and got a person who would handle he problem well of course that wasnt tue becasue it was still on my credit the next year. I didnt pay it instead I called BOA about it. This happened in 2008 I called them every few months until it was removed. It ws not removed until 2010. I never reccomend BOA to anyone. I won't even use an ATM that has their name on it. Not only did they put that bs on my credit, give bad customer service, have no valid response to why the charge was their, but I was direspected. That has to be the worst.",2012-03-12

279,BOA Just Lost A 20 Year Customer!,7397,772,Bank of America,661,1,"I have been with BOA since 1991--I opened my checking account in college. Over the majority of the years, I've experienced great customer service and highly recommended the bank to others. I have had numerous car loans, equipment loans, as well as unsecured loans. One year, I carried a 20K balance on a BOA credit card. BOA has made tons of money with me as a customer over the years! <br/> <br/>Over the past year or so, the culture has changed from great customer service to ""let me squeeze every last dime I can out of my customer."" My first thoughts were--a sign of the times--all banks are struggling. Most recently, I learned that my automatic credit card payments were set up wrong (by me). When the days fell wrong (weekend/holiday), I was unknowingly paying a late fee those months. Looking back, this added up to almost $100 over the past year. <br/> <br/>Then, this issue was compounded when I allowed my checking account to go into overdraft one month. I never worried about this, because my credit card provided overdraft protection. All of a sudden, I had several hundred dollars in overdraft fees because the credit card protection was apparently null & void when payment is not received by the due date. (Two day differential in this case.) <br/> <br/>I do realize this was all my fault, but BOA of several years ago would have said ""the error was your fault, so we will charge you one instance of overdraft ($30) and credit all the overdraft fees back to you--thank you for being a customer for 20 years."" Now, customer service reps and managers have ZERO AUTHORITY to reverse unreasonable charges (or so I was told). <br/> <br/>To the CEO--Was $200 in fees worth losing a 20 year customer? There were times in my life when BOA made well over $200 per month in interest alone from me as a customer. <br/> <br/>Over the past month, I've switched all my banking to USAA, who seems to actually want my business. USAA's insurance and brokerage business is top notch, as I have been with them 20+ years too. It's sad to see what was once such a great bank go into the toilet. <br/> <br/>Good bye Bank of America!

We were instructed by the lender to immediately reduce the ammount owed on the card, so we did. Immediately after paying down the card boa dropped his credit limit to 700 (12 more than what we had just paid it down to). This destroyed his credit score and pushed back our home buying process. We had never even received a letter telling us they were dropping it nor did we ever miss a payment or pay late. With a drastic pay increase and better credit then when the card was originally issued the dropping of his credit limit can be seen as nothing more than an attack bc they were not going to get all the intrest.

I was unhappy with their many fees, but as I always had a steady job, I didn't have too much trouble with this. Besides, I just thought many fees were the norm. However after learning of their many illegal actions and the many cases both private citizens and the US government held against them, and frustrated with the proposed $5 debit card fee, I closed my account and went to a local credit union. After I had closed my account, I had some difficulty because a paycheck was direct deposited to my old, closed account. When I called Bank of America about this, they told me the funds had not been deposited and that they could not hold them for me when they were received. Instead the funds would be sent back to my employer. Working with my HR department, I found out that the funds had actually been deposited and that the customer service representative had simply not taken the time to look it up and lied to me about it. When I called them again, they were unapologetic, refused to help me, would not send the funds to my new account, and were in general rude and unhelpful.<br/><br/> This was not the first time a Bank of America employee gave me false information.

I was not to bothered about this, mistakes can be made from time to time. But the next day when I checked my account online, I see a 5 dollars charge on my account for debit card replacement. <br/> <br/>So, just to ad insult to the injury, they not only left me with out a card and money , I could not get cash anywhere because it was after 5 when I found out they closed the debit card, and the credit card was also lost, on top of that they took my money for something that I had not requested. And to ad to that, I called the customer service line at 8:01 am, and I could not talk to anyone, and the robot was kept telling me that the hours of operation are from 7 am- some other late time, and i should call at that time.... it was 8 already.... <br/> <br/>I AM CLOSING MY ACCOUNT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2011-11-09

293,Buying A Mortgage Cautioned From Bofa,6474,772,Bank of America,4436,1,"Anyone thinking about starting a mortgage with Bank Of America may want to reconsider. With all the reorganization, lay offs, and government involvement Bank of America is going through, you may find the over worked mortgage specialist at Bank of America making a lot of mistakes and not making deadlines as promised on your closing costing you more money than you expected.. I just completed the loan process with Bank of America and some of the problems I faced were, No communication with me or inability for the loan specialist at Bank Of America to take messages., loan information going to an email address I never provided or used costing valuable time, in other words I never received some very important information, not making the closing date on time, this is one of the most important necessities of a mortgage purchase, this failure on Bank of America’s behalf cost me the seller paid escrow fee of 1500 dollars, the whole process was horrible and this was a little mortgage for under 50K. Bank of America had me down for five and one half percent interest, most lenders are going for four and one half percent or under Its is more involved, what happens after your loan is approved, more than likely there will be more mistakes long term, you may have to deal with, lost payments, Bank of America changing addresses without notification, poor customer communication and many more variables. I pulled out of the loan the same day the documents were ready to sign and close, remember this was after the closing deadline, Bank of America offered me 1000 dollars to change my mine, I explained all the problems I had with this loan and no employee at this branch including the manager seemed to care.. They proved how fast they could work when they were loosing my account by getting the docs in at 9:30pm in order to save the account and make the second deadline. Do yourself a favor, the odds are against you. After all I was a 25 year customer, that doesn’t mean much these days. Remember, you have to live with a mortgage for a very long time so do yourself a favor, shop around for the best, most honest deal you can find.",2011-10-12

According to the branch manager, the ATM that I used is not serviced by that branch, even though it is attached to the side of the bank. After 10 days without a letter or telephone call, I finally call the same dispute phone number to find out what is going on. They proceed to tell me that because I deposited another check for the same amount a few days later that they considered that to be a replacement for the original deposit. So the original ""disputed"" check will not be credited to my account. All of this without calling me or asking me about this. Now it will be an additional 10 business days for the dispute process to work itself out. It's not like the check was for that much ($1700.00), but I have been out this money for almost 1 month now.

I had never received anything from BOA informing us that there was a issue of any type with our accounts.  BOA has my email address and they did send plenty of junk emails, they never sent me an alert via my online banking, they never mailed anything to my home, never gave us a call, nothing, nothing at all, they just closed our accounts without any regard on how this would affect us.  <br/><br/>As the call progressed the more shocked I became.  I explained to them that we had called them in June due to my husbands debit card not working, and we were told at that time it had been reported lost or stolen, which we hadn't done and as it turns out wasn't the case at all.  Never once did they mention there was a problem with our accounts. I have now discovered that BOA had suspended my husbands debit card at that time so we would call to get the SSN issue corrected.  HELLO, does the right hand know what the left hand is doing, nope not at all, they just mailed my husband a new card and sent us on our way. <br/><br/>I spoke with 4 different associates during my two calls on Tuesday, August 2nd and not one of them had any interest in helping me.  My accounts remain closed, but I can open new ones with them, LOL, like thats going to happen, and I sure won't be banking with them EVER again. All 4 of they associates told me there was no way for me to get the money in my accounts as they intended on mailing me a cashiers check today, Friday, 5 days after they closed my account.  Well quess what, I went to a branch and demanded they give me my money, and I will admit the associate at the branch was very nice, and she did get my money for me.  <br/><br/>At this point, I can't get any statements, as I kept them online, I can't get any of my bill pay information.  I am going to have to spend alot of time now trying to contact all my service providers and have them stop either sending my bills to BOA and/or stop taking the automatic payments from that account, what a PITA. <br/><br/> I will do all I can to get this information out to as many people as I can.  BOA had no right to do what they did and then to just flat out not care and have no regard for a long term customer is just shameful.  They get negative stars from me.",2011-08-05

303,Simply The Worst,5424,772,Bank of America,3196,1,"Back when I was in College in the late 1960's, I worked as an investigator in the banking business. Bank of America was just a California Institution then, but they developed the ""Bank on every street corner"" business model, and they got rich. Unfortunately, that was the last good idea they ever had. Even back in the 1960's, they were known as ""The Dumbest Bank in America.""<br/><br/> Unfortunately, they buy up everybody. I find a credit card I like, Bank of America buys it and trashes it. Twice I have left after the merger announcement, but this last time I stuck with them. I'm not sure whether it was a decision, or that I'm older, and it was just inertia. Bad mistake. There have been many problems, alnd I won't waste your time with all of them. I'll keep it to two.<br/><br/> I buy regularly from a website in India. Anyone who can read could look at my sttatements and know this. Yet suddenly BOA security people decided that my latest India charge was fraudulent, so they shut down my card. They neglected to inform me of this little detail, so a number of charges were kicked back, damaging my reputation. One charge that was refused was for the medicine that keeps me alive.<br/><br/> Secondly, this is the text of a message I left on their website feedback page today:<br/><br/> ""Absolutely the worst financial website in the world. It's so cluttered that the site designers can't keep track of the complexities, and links wind up taking you to the wrong places. It takes too many clicks to get down to business. Today another layer has been added that I have to get through to get to my Mastercard account information, AND IT DOESN'T WORK!!! I click on my account, or on the ""account details"" tab, and it takes me to a page topped with ""How do you want to pay?"" along with a bunch of dumb ads. I never was able to find my balance, check the transaction I wanted to check, or redeem my rewards (I should have over 40,000 points, and I want a check). Absolutely pathetic.

A few months after we bought the house we got married. BofA said to change my name to my now married name. It was going to cost almost $20,000 just to change a name...really?!? So, umm no. <br/> <br/> 2. My husband was laid off at work. I called BofA to tell them I couldn't make all the payment, but I could make some. They told me to pay what I could and they were gonna set me up for a ""loan modification"" and it would take 7-10 days to get my ""package"" in the mail. The next month I called about the same thing, and they told me the same thing. When I told the girl I haven't received my ""package"" she said it could take 30-45 days. The next month I called and the lady said that they have never spoken with me about anything! WHAT! Are you freaking kidding me!!! She then told me to STOP paying and wait for my ""package"" to arrive. <br/> <br/> 3. Waited 7 months! to get 7 papers that could have been emailed to me! I gathered up all my info and sent it back the following week. <br/> <br/> 4. 3 months later I was told that I had been denied b/c I had whited out my bank account number. Ok fine...that was my mistake. I didn't feel comfortable sending my bank account number through the mail! My bad. But really, nobody could have called and told me? Or emailed me, or sent me something through the mail? I was calling every other day and nobody told me! <br/> <br/> 5. After that they said I could go through an ""in house modification"" where in 30-45 days I will know if I'm approved or not. 2 weeks later they denied me b/c my husband hadn't had his job for more than a year! Well duh!! That's what got me in this situation in the first place!! <br/> <br/> 6. I found that out on June 1st that on June 6th my house went to auction, but it didn't sell. I am now being forced to move out of my home that I was led to believe for a year that I was going through an in home modification! After I was denied my 2nd time I said I wanted to ""APPEAL IT"". As far as I knew I was in the middle of an appeal, and then I started getting letters from attorneys offices telling me I had to vacate the property and appear in court. <br/> <br/> 7. BofA is the worst bank I've EVER banked with! I will be closing my 2 savings accounts and my credit card through them. <br/> <br/> 8. My mother in Law works for BofA in the loan modification dept, and told me that they are trained to lie to people. She said it's a Q and A. We ask a question, they find the answer on their paper and tell us. She would tell me exactly what they were going to say, and she was always right! I would call day after day, sometimes 3-5 times a day and they would tell me I haven't called in 2 months! Again...are you freaking kidding me?!? <br/> <br/> 9. I'm glad to be done with BofA!

313,Why I Wish I Never Opened A Bank Of America Account,4759,772,Bank of America,2750,1,"It has been a LONG time since I have gotten this upset. I won't go into details but here's how it breaks down. 1. I've been a customer of BOA since 2003. I have never received any nice perks nor have I ever experienced an extraordinary show of customer service. 2. When I was in middle school, I was set up with a checking and savings account. I was told that if my checking account had an overdraft, my savings account would cover it. Nowhere in my paperwork did it state that there would be a $20 fee. I have still to this date not found this fee in any of their terms and agreements. It's such a stereotype but there really are hidden fees. 3. Their online bill pay is not reliable. People choose to pay online because they trust that BOA will do what they are supposed to do. Instead, canceled payments have still gone through; payments have arrived late; and scheduled payments magically disappear. Their excuse is that I need to print confirmations and hold onto them for 60 days but then again, how is that convenient? 4. This branch's manager assured me that she would reverse my late fee which was as a result of their flawed online bill pay system, let me know that I would get a follow-up call in a few days; and would cancel my pending online bill payments. Instead, the late fee was still there, I never got a call, and the canceled bill payment still went through. 5. Branch managers have more authority than the customer service reps at the 1(800) number. This means that for some issues, you have to go into a branch. How convenient. 6. The customer service reps don't have the slightest clue what customer service means. I get interrupted, transferred to machines where I have to re-state my issue MULTIPLE times; talked back to; told NO NO NO; and lied to. Supposedly they document all phone calls but they don't. You cannot count on all of them to follow through or do what they say; some reps have been good but the negative overshadows those few individuals that try and do a good job. 7. Checking, savings, and CD interest rates are a joke. Do yourself a favor and open a Schwab.",2011-05-26
314,Not For A Lay Man Bank,4721,772,Bank of America,2729,3,"Bank of America is huge, huge banking institute that, as expected, does not care much for the masses. Although, it is evident, that they do care about extracting your last single penny out of you in order to run! Students, people with average to low income, please refrain from opening an account here. My review is not about any particular type of account or any branch. It is in general pertaining to BOA and its policies that are adopted all over the country. The interest rates for deposits, savings accounts and similar are low, even lower for smaller deposits or terms and the loan interest rates are high. Credit card rates are super high, the limits pretty low and the charges stupendous. All in all I will ask every ""lay-man"" to go to a smaller local bank or even a credit union that will actually care for you.",2011-05-23

Bank of America offers a ton of different types of bank accounts, credit cards, and investment services. My main problem with Bank of America is their services fees.

I did whatever is legal and necessary to accomplish that end. When I received the paper work (certificate of Name Change) from our company's lawyer and the State government with the new name duly approved, I took the papers to the bank to have them change the title of the account accordingly.  Little did I know what I was getting into. The employee whom I saw was reluctant to do anything and pretended to speak with someone at higher level on the phone who asked  why we were changing the name, then proceeded to ask for all kind of documentation -- which I provided. But they wanted originals, even though there were names of State officials and their phone #s to make any consultation. This employee was. They asked for papers I never heard off. I had been with them for over a year and things were going well, but this little and simple request seemed to get them out of their box.  Long story short, I proceeded to close the account to which they say , that's OK!!  This employee never even tried to keep our business with them -- which, by the way, was not bad at all. I walked out so dissapointed. I was treated so badly that I would not recommend this Bank for anything, they do not seem to care about the needs of the clients. Down BoA!!",2011-04-15

Why would I want to discuss my personal banking business in the middle of a lobby for everyone to hear?<br/><br/> Then they are always asking if I have their debit card when I have already handed them my drivers license. I DO NOT WANT THE DEBIT CARD, but they keep pressuring me to get it. I have never had a bank where I leave angry half the time but, over silly stuff.<br/><br/> If I'm getting cash they loudly count the money, so everyone can hear how much I'm walking out with. They just do not have a clue about bank decorum.<br/><br/> The bottom line is that this bank is very gimmicky. It is constantly bothering me about something, but, does nothing for me to speak of. I expect banks to provide interest on my savings and keep my money safe. That's fairly simple, I think.

Basically BoA can share my personal information with pretty much anyone they want and there is very little I can do to limit this sharing. This likely has a lot to do with the number of telemarketers who phone my home routinely offering some ""service"" that I don't want and don't need, and the amount of junk mail I receive. The realization that I have little privacy with BoA and their new policy of charging three bucks for ""check imaging"" on the monthly statement is enough to make me investigate other banking opportunities, and to visit my local branch and express my distaste.

The small town bank had way different policies and procedures than those of Bank of America. After becoming familiar with their policies, it was easy to get started. The employees at the banking locations are always helpful and kind. On the other hand, if you have to go through the customer service telephone line, those people aren't always as helpful or kind.<br/><br/> Bank of America started allowing customers to deposit money in the form of checks or cash into ATMs, which is a good idea and something I was very excited about. I wanted to call to find out more details before I messed something up. When I talked to the customer service on the phone, the lady informed me it was as simple as inserting the check and the funds would be immediately available. That was NOT the correct information as I latter found out. There is a hold on checks that are over $100.<br/><br/> Overall, I have had a positive experience with Bank of America. I believe their only downfall is that they don't communicate things very well to their customers on their new features and full information regarding the features.",2011-02-22

330,Why Do I Still Bank At Bofa?,3867,772,Bank of America,2102,2,"I joined Bank of America when I was 17 years old, approx 7 years ago. In that time I have been continually disappointed in them. I worked at a credit union for a year and so I understand the processes and procedures of the banking world.<br/><br/> My first negative experience occurred when I had set up an automatic payment from my BOA checking account to my BOA credit card. I had it on auto pay and wanted to change it. So I contaced BOA and they instructed me on how to make the change thru my online banking. I did this. The day of the payment comes and they took it out TWICE, resulting in overdrawing my account. Then for every charge that hit, I incurred another $35 OD fee. I had gotten paid direct deposit that next day at midnight and all my money was absorbed for fees, with no time to work things out. I called the 1-800 number and explained my situation and they COULD NOT care less. They show no customer care. This was THEIR fault and they REFUSED to credit me back my OD fees. I went to my local branch and tried pleading my case with the asst manager who said there had been notes placed on my account not to refund the fees. So I withdrew all my money and closed my credit card.<br/><br/> I also deposited a check at the drive thru one day recently and it was drawn on BOA. This was also $100. This should have been immidiately credited to my account. But it was placed on hold. When I saw the hold, I called the 1-800 number and they LITERALLY could NOT tell me why it was on hold. He said it was at the discretion of the teller who took the check. Now I could POSSIBLY see placing it on hold if my account had been negative or it I maybe had less than $100. But I had $3,000 in my savings there!!!<br/><br/> Bottom line is they are inconsistent with their policies, only care about upselling you to a freakin money market, CD or savings, and they could care less about customer retention. The ONLY reason I still maintain accounts there is because I do like their online & mobile banking. But I have moved most of my money aay from BofA. And I never encourage anyone I know to bank there.. GO TO A CREDIT UNION INSTEAD WHERE THEY ARE FOCUSED ON MEMBER SERVICE AND YOU GETTER BETTER RATES OF RETURNS ON CD'S AND LOWER RATES ON LOANS.",2011-02-21

335,Adequate But Not Great. They Look For Ways To Take Advantage Of You.,3839,772,Bank of America,2066,2,"I've had an account with Bank of America ever since they merged with Nations Bank back in 1998. Convenience is the reason I've stayed with them. When I was in school, they had me on a no-fee student account. When I graduated, I kept the account because they didn't (and still do not) charge fees to people with monthly direct deposits. I currently live in NYC and BoA ATMs are everywhere I need them to be. <br/><br/> When I leave NYC two years from now, I look forward to switching to a local credit union or other bank. Below is a summary of my expierience with them.<br/><br/> Advantages to BoA: <br/> They have a good website, and their Portfolio funciton works really well. It's powered by the same software that powers Mint.com, so you can see all of your accounts in one place. This is really convenient. ATMs everywhere. Partnerships with overseas banks. When I was in France last summer, I was able to avoid foreign transaction fees by using my BoA card at BNP Paribas ATMs.  They sponsor a promotion where people with BoA cards get free admission to numerous museums, zoos, and aquariums. Disadvantages:<br/> Their savings account interest rates and CD rates are lower than elsewhere. I use BoA for day-to-day checking/cash withdrawals, and keep larger amounts in other banks. Many of my friends have had bad experiences with BoA charging unexpected fees. I haven't run into this because I have direct deposit, but the impression I get is that they view the customers as a resource to be exploited, and that it's gotten worse with the passage of credit reform laws. Customer service is not great. When I lost a card, they were quick to answer that. When I've had other, less urgent problems or questions, they put me on hold for lengthy periods of time.",2011-02-19

I am being charged for my savings acct after having it for almost 6 years for free because I have direct deposit going into it, and now since August 2010 I have been charged a fee of $5.00 per month. When I called to get it removed they said they could credit me for $5.00, but not the $30.00 because they sent me a letter 2 months ago that I did not receive stating I would be charged this fee if I didn't have at least $300 in my account at all times. I never received this letter, but have also been paperless since last year. I then asked to speak to a manager and I was transferred to escalations. Not sure if escalations meant to help or escalate me even more. I was then told by her that I received the letter via email back in July, and if I signed into my account I would find it. I did while on the phone and it was not there, and she said she would resend via mail to me now...so did I get the letter via email back in July or like the first rep said mail 2 months ago? Needless to say, I have never received this letter, and when I asked to have the credit she told me she would have her manager call me back in 72 business hours. when I asked who I could send an escalated letter to she started to give me the address and hung up on me.

341,Saga Of The Check Fraud That Was A BOA Error,3631,772,Bank of America,1937,1,"We have a checking and a savings account with BOA. We do our primary banking with another bank; therefore, we use BOA mainly as a savings account. We received a folded postcard from BOA notifying us that $38,000 had been withdrawn from our savings account (there was only $13,000 in the account) the notice stated that we should make a deposit within 5 business days of $25,000 to cover the overdraft and we were being charged a $35 overdraft charge.<br/><br/> What bank would allow anyone to withdraw $38,000 from an account with total holdings of $13,000? We didn't remove anything from our savings, in fact on the day this withdrawal occurred we actually deposited funds into our savings account.<br/><br/> We called BOA Customer Service and were given to the Check Fraud Division where we waited for 5 minutes listening to obnoxious music and while waiting for a rep from the Check Fraud Division. The representative at first said ""this was a banking error"" then she decided it wasn't and would have to be turned over to a fraud analyst.  When we asked when we would have resolution she stated the fraud analyst would call us .  We asked to speak with her manager and were put into a voice mail box and then disconnected.  We called back and got another Check Fraud Dept rep who asked if the  first rep had read us a ""disclosure of our rights"".  The first rep never said that we would be liable for any further withdrawals from the account if we did not freeze the account. We froze the account.<br/><br/> We spent the rest of the night on the phone contacting the other financial institutions that we do business with as well as putting a fraud watch on Equifax.  The next morning we went into the BOA Banking Center Manager who said, after a cursory review of our account activity, ""it didn't happen at this bank"" but upon further investigation she determined that it indeed did happen at the local bank.  She said it was a 'keying error"". Apparently a customer came in after us and asked to have $38,000 removed from his savings and he asked for a counter check.  The bank removed $38,000 from our savings and gave him the check.  <br/><br/> It appears that the  situation has been resolved (we will believe it when we get a statement showing that our funds have been returned to us and the $35 overdraft charge has been removed).  We firmly believe had we not persisted with the local Bank Manager BOA would never have found their error.<br/><br/> When you are afraid that your identity has  been stolen and your accounts compromised it is very frightening indeed. Dealing with BOA Check Fraud Division compounds the fear because it is like falling into a black hole - no customer service, no follow-up, no communication, no help at all. The BOA Check Fraud Division clearly exists to serve BOA not the customer. Needless to say we are closing our accounts with BOA",2011-01-27
342,Poor Treatment By Bank Of America,3577,772,Bank of America,1899,1,"We have been Bank of America customers for over 30 years.  In 30 years I have never had a check returned NSF until now.  We have two business accounts and a personal account.  I wrote a check from my personal account to my business account and deposited it into the ATM at 8:30 in the morning.  This was all between Bank of America accounts.  Later that day I wrote a check out of the business account to a third party.  Little did I know that for the first time ever in my relationship with Bank of America they had put a hold on the deposit at 1 PM that day even though they knew the funds were there because it came from one B of A account to another.  As a result, the check I wrote to the third party was returned (even though the funds were there) and I was charged $35 for the returned check (even though the funds were there).  I went to the local branch and all I was told was that they had the right to do that and the hold would have been noted on the ATM receipt.  I went home and looked at the receipt and it indicated that the funds were deposited that day with no mention of a hold.  I went back to the branch and spoke to someone else who (while the answer was no different) was at least sympathetic and helpful as opposed to the first person who defiantly stood behind the ""bank rules"" and left us helpless.  Ultimately, I did get the $35 refunded and a letter given to the third party's bank explaining that the situation was a result of an internal matter at B of A and in no way reflected on us or the third party.  I have since talked to other B of A employees and no one can believe that a hold Was placed on a deposit between B of A accounts when the funds were there.  Last week my husband made a deposit to his business account of $20000.  We needed the deposit to post so we could pay payroll taxes.  We were told that $5000 was being held until the next banking day and the balance was being held 10 days.  He also deposited $25000 in checks from Kraft Foods Int'l a nationally known company.  He has been depositing these checks in these figures weekly ever since he  opened the account 4 years earlier.  They also said that they would release only $5000 with the balance to be held for 10 days.  This was the first time they had ever done that even though we had NEVER had a check returned since we opened the account.  Since he needed funds to deposit immediately he asked what he could do to get the funds deposited quicker.  He was told he needed to make a cash deposit although they did not advocate this for safety reasons.  Left with no choice, my husband had to go withdraw money from another bank and walk $20000 cash into the bank which was located in a less than stellar neighborhood.  Ny husband went back five days later to see why they still were holding the funds when they should have been cleared by then.  The telephone agent said that the funds still had not been released by either of the other banks ( Citibank and Chase).  If that were truly the case then why did they release $5000 on each deposit?  We feel we are not being told the truth but you can't talk to anybody with any power and customer service savvy.  When Bank of America was a California company and you could speak with managers in person who had power it was a great bank.  Now, all I want to do is move all of my accounts to a smaller bank of credit union that works with you instead of against you.  ",2011-01-22

348,Bank Of America - More Than Bad Banking...Harassment And Lies!,2721,772,Bank of America,1436,1,"   I was very excited to open my new checking and savings accounts through Bank of America. I had just started a job in Tacoma, wa that used B.O.A. as their bank and if I had an account there I could deposit my checks with no fees. For the first few months, I loved B.O.A. I was young and trying to start financially ""building a life"" for myself so I decided to open a credit card through B.O.A. BAD IDEA!!  I was hoping to build up good credit as I had no credit record at this point in my life.  The account's only fee mentioned was that of a single late fee if the payment was not made on time. This seemed reasonable. Over the next few months, I started to notice charges on my account that were incorrect. Each time I found one, I called B.O.A and, after long debate, they usually corrected these errors. After I charged a hospital bill to my card and the balance was closer to the limit, things got ugly. I always made my payments in full and on time. B.O.A, however, began adding more and more fees for various reasons that had NOT been part of the initial contract. Every time I contacted them, I was given an ear full of stories that NEVER gave any real explanation. If I continued to question them about this they would put me on hold for 20 minutes or longer and then disconnect the line. If this had happened once or twice, I would be willing to assume it was an accident but EVERY time??? Come on, now. I also began noticing false charges to my account supposedly made in places I had never even been. After doing the dance with B.O.A several more times over this, I finally became so fed up that I borrowed the money from a family member and paid off the account. I asked that ALL of my accounts be frozen as I knew no more charges or transactions were due to come through and I would most definitely NOT be banking with Bank of America again. I choze to freeze my accounts because a B.O.A. adviser said it would effect my credit negitively if I just closed the account right away. I confirmed this with other agentcies.  The employee I spoke with argued to the best of her ability but finally gave in, accepted the payment and froze my accounts...OR DID SHE?  Four months later, I recieved a statement in the mail. Everything looked as though no transactions had been made to my checking or savings accounts. Now, might I remind you these statements are ALWAYS seperate from the credit card statement. However, on this statement, in very small print at the bottom was a notice stating that a charge had been made to my credit card and that I had failed to make my payment on time. Funny...my card had been cut up, my checks burned...how is this possible?  I called B.O.A once again for our ritual song and dance of complete disrespect...they informed me that this had been a mistake and that they would ""take care of it right away"". WRONG! EVERY YEAR I do a credit check on my self and EVERY YEAR it shows up that B.O.A closed my account for failure to make payments on time. EVERY YEAR we argue, it gets corrected and we continue on until the next credit check. This year, 2010, I checked my credit and once again my dear friends at B.O.A have reported that my account was closed for failure to pay on time. This year's song and dance lasted for close to an hour with multiple holds and transfers to different departments ending with...care to guess?...a transfer to a closed department that disconnected the line. Thank you, Bank Of America, for the never ending nightmare of harassment and complete disrespect. See you in court.",2010-10-10
349,"There Were Great Times, There Were Worst Times",2653,772,Bank of America,1396,2,I have been a long time banker at BOA...very long.<br/><br/> I had some great experiences with the bank. There were times when I would overdraft and they would take my overdraft charge away at request. They made my credit card payment easy to pay by lowering my interest rate and allowing small payments to be taken out of my account each month. It wasn't until recently that we had problems.<br/><br/> I was given a check for $250. I cashed the check and took out $50. Two days later I get a call from BOA and am told without a reason that I am no longer allowed to bank with them. They kicked me out quicker then hobo in the Trump tower. When I called to find out why they said that my the check I had cashed was from a fake account and that I was putting the bank at risk....!!!<br/><br/> So there I was with no source of income since they pretty much told me I would have to wait up to 2 weeks to recieve the money I had in my account. Not to mention it was the end of the month meaning bills had to be paid. After I spoke to about 4 rude customer service reps who told me to just go to another bank and that they were sorry because there was nothing they could do I headed over to Chase. Now I am responsible person and my credit is decent so when I was told that I was not able to join Chase I wanted answers.<br/><br/> Turned out BOA blacklisted me. I was and still am not able to join any bank for up to FIVE YEARS!!! I even showed proof to them that the check had no connection to me and it was given to me for graphic work I had done for a client. I made a lawsuite out of it and that is still pending because the client is no where to be found...and I am stuck with this mess. BOA may seem great in their commercials and may offer perks here and there but when I say they will leave you high and dry...I mean seriously they will leave you without care in the world and ruin you while they are at it so you don't want to bank with anyone but them...,2010-09-30

They approved me for a overdraft line of credit for my checking account which comes in really handy. I haven't had any fees with them. They only charge a percentage for using the overdraft line of credit if you don't have it paid back to positive by the end of the month. Whenever I have to call them, whichever representative I get is really nice and professional. So far the main issue I have had with them is that their app is not always functioning when I need it. I have to re enter into the app which can get pretty annoying. One of my favorite features is the lock debit card feature. If you lose your card temporarily you can lock your car from the app and unlock it just as fast. Another good thing is if you refer a friend (using your special link) and they open a checking or savings (meeting the right conditions) they can get a bonus and you would also get a bonus. It is a cool way for some extra cash if you know someone who is looking. Over these years, I still have the accounts and I plan to stay with them. They have been my favorite so far. I just wish they would get the bugs worked out of their app.",2018-05-31
384,Great bank,33953,20928,Capital One,50860,5,My experience of banking with Capital One 360 has been great. I have no fees. I bank at home never having to walk into a bank. My bank balance is always accurate and my transactions post immediately. I earn interest on anything I put into the bank. I can find my bank account # and routing # in my app which is helpful rather than having to search for a check which I rarely use. When I make a transfer from checking to savings or savings to checking it's immediate.,2018-05-28
385,Capital One versus ING,33946,20928,Capital One,50852,3,"I began my high yield online savings account over 10 years ago with ING Direct. I poured my meager savings into the account, despite my father's opinion that it wouldn't make a difference because I didn't have enough money to make the 4.5% interest rate worth it. In my opinion, it is equally beneficial for people with lots and with little money. I made a good amount of interest over the years that ING was managing the account. The interest rate was high, and comparably very high when compared to brick and mortar banks. I never had an issue that required me to speak to the customer service department. The web access was always easy and allowed me to accomplish what I needed to.<br/>When ING became Capital One 360, I was disappointed with the result. I had no expectations, as I had not heard anything about a switch. This is disappointing to me because as an account holder with ING, I would have hoped to get some sort of notification. And I was an account holder with Capital One as well. Once the takeover was done, the interest rate plumeted and I was asked to change my username and password. It is not the same. It is disappointing.",2018-05-27
386,Convenient banking from anywhere,33895,20928,Capital One,50745,4,"CapitalOne 360 allows you to manage your finances easily and from anywhere. No-fee checking and interest-paying savings make it easy to save for the future and manage your bills now. You can shift money between accounts with the click of a few buttons, from your phone or computer, any time day or night. Deposit checks by taking a picture with your phone. Set up different accounts for different purposes. I've used CapitalOne 360 to start a vacation fund, save for a car, and put money aside for annual expenses such as property tax and insurance payments. I never worry about opening another account for a special purpose because CapitalOne 360 doesn't charge monthly fees for accounts. I can log on any time to check my balance, and it was easy to set up automatic payments for recurring bills. I've only had to contact customer service once in the ten years I've had my accounts, but the person on the other end of the line was super helpful and resolved my problem right away.",2018-05-25
387,Best online bank out there,33786,20928,Capital One,50584,5,I opened a capital one 360 account two years ago and I love it. I use this account for my vacation fund. It's easy to use and the online banking is easy to to work. The app is easy to deposit checks or transfer money. I like that this account pays a decent apy for a checking account. This account also is 100 percent free and there are no fees for not having a certain balance or anything. The best thing was the sign up bonus I received when I opened it. Overall I would definitely recommend capital one 360 to anyone.,2018-05-17
388,Love my bank,33781,20928,Capital One,50579,5,"I have been a capital one member since they were ING Direct. I have a primary checking account as well as several savings accounts. It is so easy to create a new savings account if I want to set money aside for something special. I also set several up for my nieces so I could set money aside for their college expenses. Capitol one also makes it easy to pay bills, pay people, and set up recurring payments and/or money transfers. My paycheck is deposited every two weeks and I automatically move part of that money to savings without thinking about it. I had to contact customer service for assistance with a lost card and they were very helpful and made sure my old card was disabled to prevent fraudulent charges. Best part is I never have any monthly fees and my savings account rate is great!",2018-05-16

It has been a good experience with this online bank. I am able to have several ""sub categories"" of savings account, in order to save for specific goals. The online system in easy to access and use and it is easy to transfer money between accounts. Withdrawals process with in a few days.

Also, deposits and withdraws to and from the account are a breeze - I only set up once the other institution and then chose from drop-down menu. Customer service is by email only but they answer all my questions thoroughly and in timely manner - always within 24 hours! I'd never ever use another bank for my money. I have never done banking on mobile phone but they do provide it. They also have a cafe for each area where customers can go and share experience.",2018-05-12

When first started had issues with customer service (5 years ago)-but now good. Though they customer services hours are not 24 hours, and there is no chat option which is difficult for me.

392,Capital One 360,33046,20928,Capital One,50054,4,"At first, I did not know what to expect from an online only bank. However, I must say Capital One 360 exceeds my expectations. They provide excellent customer service and are easy to deal with and knowledgeable. In addition, this checking account earns interest and does not charge any fees (meaning you do not have to maintain a minimum and will not be charged for not having direct deposit or whatever most bank accounts require). They also have ATM's that are free of fee's so that you can pull out money without being charged. Their website and mobile layout are super clean and easy to use.

394,CAP1 NOW BLOCKING ON-LINE BANKING ACCESS!,33636,20928,Capital One,3011,3,"Along with other banks, Capital 1 asks existing customers logging into the on-line banking site, to update their salary and work status information. They make a point to say they are ""required"" to by ""Federal Regulation"", and it's specifically for the purpose of approving a credit line increase. <br/><br/>I was always able to click ""Accounts"" at the top of the Capital 1 page and bypass the inquiry because A) I didn't want or need a credit line increase and B) if Capital 1 wanted to offer me an increase, well, they ought to ASK me first. If I want it, I'll provide them the info they need to make a determination on ability to pay, which is what those cited Federal Regulations say they have to do.<br/><br/>Until today. Logged in as usual but was redirected to a page with a stupid, cheery message announcing they'd revamped their website..... but before they would show me what it looked like, I had to provide them with salary and work status information. WTF kind of cheeky nonsense is that? Again, ominous federal regulations giving them no choice in the matter, and still, it's for this non-existent credit line increase I don't want, need, haven't asked for and they haven't offered. No way to bypass it now. Comply or You Can't See the new Website, and of course, you can't access your accounts. Any of them. I have 3, only 1 is a credit card account. <br/><br/>Whoever thought this strategy up needs to find another job, perhaps waterboarding blind folded ISIS prisoners. <br/><br/>FYI, I took it to Facebook and Twitter so far to let people know, and hopefully somebody in Capital 1 senior management will tap the brakes on this, or if they knew, put their ego on the shelf and do a sanity check. <br/><br/>Otherwise I am a perfectly happy Capital 1 customer for both banking and credit, until this totally weird, random event today.",2018-04-28

We wanted this to be in a separate account than our regular everyday banking to ensure it would be available in the case of emergency. Also, since it is a large dollar value ($60,000) we were looking to earn better-than-market interest. The Capital One 360 online savings account met our needs with a 1% interest rate at the time. We are now earning 1.5% as rates have increased overtime. It is very easy for us to transfer funds in and out of this account to our day-to-day bank account. Also, we have a Capital One credit card and the login is tied to our bank account, which makes things easy and streamlined with the excellent mobile app. We have been very happy here!",2018-04-27

398,Capital One 360 Savings Account,32914,20928,Capital One,49876,4,"Signing up for this bank account, to start, was very easy. Ever since it has continued to be just as easy in all fronts. The website and mobile app are set up very well and that, combined with the interest rate of 1%, makes this bank very favorable. I love online banking and I have other accounts but this is by far the most high tech and pleasing to the eyes. If you're a fan of aesthetics and a decent interest rate on savings accounts, then you'll love this. If you love the same things, I think you would enjoy banking here. However, I do have some complaints that I do have is that this bank has less than desirable customer service. The workers hardly ever speak good English and, when they do, they have a sense that they are better than you. They'll get your complaint processed (after a few weeks), but it won't be a fun process for you. Additionally, it takes a very long time for transactions to process on this account. My first deposit into the account was pending for over a week and I had to call to get it posted. I think that that is ridiculous especially because the interest is based on day by day. All in all, it's what you would expect of a savings account and I do recommend it for fellow college students and young people in general.",2018-04-23
399,Capital 360 Savings Account,32905,20928,Capital One,49867,4,"I really love my Capital One 360 Savings Account. It allows me to have several savings accounts under different names, so I can budget out where my savings go. This works out well for me because then I don't accidentally use the money intended for something else. So, I can keep my Christmas money separate from my money I am savings for taxes and so forth. It really helps me budget better and have a better idea of where my money is going. I can do all this from my computer or an app on my cell phone. It really comes in handy when I am somewhere and need to transfer money from one account to another in a hurry. I don't have to wait until I can get to my computer, but can just go to the app and transfer the money I need. This is the most convenient savings account I have ever had.",2018-04-22
400,Great concept but needs fine-tuning,32877,20928,Capital One,49839,4,"I enjoy using Capital One 360 checking and savings because there are no monthly fees and no minimum balance. This works for me because I generally keep a low balance and mostly use my debit card for online shopping, bill payment or running errands without the need to carry a lot of cash. The actual Capital One branch is quite far from me so it's a bit of a hassle for me to go there when I want to deposit cash. However with the ability to deposit checks right through the app, it helps a lot. I don't have to go to the bank every time I sell something on eBay and get a small check. You can also turn your debit card on and off using the app for security. And if you have a Capital One credit card, it's a no-hassle set up to pay the bill using the 360 account. Ok so those are the good things about the bank. Here are some of the negatives. For one thing, I have been trying to add my husband as a joint account user online for months, and every time it says there is a security issue and it can't be done. I tried calling customer service and after being on hold for an hour, was told that the issue was that I had changed my phone number recently, and I should wait 2 weeks for the number to update on their back end. I waited more than 2 weeks, still the same problem. It has now been over a month- how long does it take this company to update a phone number? The other thing that is annoying is that the mobile app doesn't have all the features that are on the website. For example, you can't (try to) add a joint user on the mobile app but must do it on a desktop.",2018-04-20

402,My Time With Capital One Free 360 Checking,32864,20928,Capital One,49826,4,"I signed up for and used Capital One's free 360 checking. It is an online only checking account. The reason I signed up for it was because they had an incentive program where I earned $150 promotional bonus for signing up and having a direct deposit into the account. I was very happy with the fees (there were none) and customer service (I never had any problems and only talked to them once when I was ready to close the account.) I really only signed up for the account for the bonus so when I had satisfied all of the requirements I closed the account. I believe I had the account for six months. Had I not had a checking account and savings account already established with a different bank I would consider using the Capital One free checking because there were not a lot of hoops to jump through to get the free checking.

First of all, the account was extremely easy to open and set up, with their helpful customer service representatives just a call away, should they be needed. Since opening my account with them, they have offered very competitive interest rates, along with competitive, and often non-existent, fees. For example, their both their money market and savings accounts offer interest rates consistently higher than their peers. Also, their checking account gives 50 free checks, and has no minimum balance requirements.

I love this bank because it allows me to open as many savings accounts as I want at no cost. I use the envelope method to pay down debt and to save for future expenses and this has been a great way for me to keep track of all of my money. I love this bank because transferring money from account to account is simple and fast. I even do transfers between capital one and my local credit union every week and the transfers always post quickly. When I needed to talk to customer service about a withdrawal from my account that I didn't initiate they dealt with it in a very professional manner and made sure my account was secure. I can not say enough positive things about Capital One.,2018-04-03

The experience has been superb with no hitches to date. No issue with customer service and transfers out usually take place within one to two business days. The online interface, perhaps the most important part of an online banking service, is intuitive and reliable, and the same goes for the mobile version of the website. The interest rates have already seen multiple hikes since I signed up as well, as the bank tries to stay competitive with its competitors. I make more interest in a single month with Capital One's money market account than I did the entirety of last year with U.S. Bank. It feels good to know that my money isn't just sitting there earning nothing and my rates have been increasing so that I don't feel like I constantly need to shop around.

There are Customer Serice Reps available whenever I need them who actual do their work and call you back with results. I ordered checks for my account and they were never received. I was panicked especially since they had all my information and banking accounts information. The customer reps did all the tracking and worked with the outside company they use to buy the checks and actually found THE box of my stuff (was put on the wrong truck!) and expedited the checks to get to my house directly the next day.

They are always up to date, shows up ahead of time what is scheduled to go on. It's easy to go in an cancel a transaction on the rare occasion that we need to. Transferring extra money to the account is easy, transferring money out (which we have had to do so occasionally) is easy although it can take an extra couple days. That's the only down fall we've had transferring money in and out of the account takes a few days. So although we have money scheduled every Friday it's sometimes Tuesday or Wed. before it's available in our account. <br/> <br/>I have recently added a capital 360 checking out.

413,Easiest Banking Ever,32048,20928,Capital One,48326,4,"When I was loking to switch banks, I read reviews online. I decided to go with Capital One 360. It was the easiest banking experience I ever encountered! It took only a few minutes to open a checking account and savings account. I didn't use it immediately, and they do have a requirement that you deposit money within 60 days for it to remain open. (which I did) It's simple to check your balances, order debit cards, and schedule direct deposits. When you deposit money into your account, you can then order your first 50 checks for free. This online bank is convenient because you can open up to 25 savings accounts. It makes it easy to open accounts to save money for both my children and have it all in one place. The only downside is that most of the ATM's around our area have problems. You can still withdraw from any ATM, but you're charged a fee unless you use their particular ATM's. (Which is normal) However, there is no fee on their ATM's. (Also normal)",2018-03-02

I joined it as ING Direct several years ago and have stayed with them through a few name changes. Initially it was the higher interest rates that brought me to them as a customer for my savings account. While interest rates have fallen quite a bit over the past several years, the ease of using my accounts there has kept me as a customer. It is simple to transfer money from my primary bank account to my Capital One360 account whenever I need to. Transferring from one CapitalOne360 account to another is also simple and fast. The one downside is that if I need to transfer from CapitalOne360 to my main bank account, it takes several days for the money to transfer.

I chose to open up this online-only savings account in order to utilize their excellent APR interest rate of over 1.0%. This allows me to stow away excess loan funds and any money I earn from working my part time job, while making some extra money through interest. Most other banks online offer around 0.2% interest. It was very easy to open up an account online for the 360 savings account, and the entire process only took around 15 minutes. I would highly recommend this account to anyone who is interested in a high interest, low cost savings account.",2018-03-01
416,Not the best,32031,20928,Capital One,48308,3,This bank is okay. There isn't anything particularly great. I have had a couple instances where I have had to call about an issue and it didn't seem the agent knew much. My issue went unresolved. They actually told me to call the other bank involved. It takes a day or two for mobile deposits to post to your account and you have to pay $5.00 to order checks. I wouldn't recommend them but I have had that account for quite some time and only use it for a direct deposit. I have also been charged $25 for an overdraft of less then $1.00. I think if they are going to offer mediocre products they should at the very least offer exceptional customer service. It would also be nice to have access to my money sooner instead of everything being placed on a hold and then bouncing checks because my money is on hold.,2018-02-28
417,You Cannot Designate Beneficiaries,32160,20928,Capital One,48492,1,"The rates are competitive but they slow to transfer money. But the real deal breaker is that you cannot designate beneficiaries on the 360 Money Market account. That means that, unlike just about every other bank or financial institution on the planet, if (actually, when) you pass away, your beneficiaries will have to go through probate, which is time consuming and expensive.",2018-02-26

I signed up me and my children and we all got a reward. The bank had changed ownership, but the rules don't mysteriously change for the banking. I don't always make deposits, but no fees are charged to me. My brick and mortar bank just charged 10 dollars per month for not making a deposit in two years. Not this online bank. There are no fees associated with the account, so I don't have to worry about losing my children's life savings. I can easily transfer money any time of day online to this account. I am pleased with the email communications and not having to worry about paper statements flooding my desk. Everything is at the convenience of a computer. The interest rates have been slightly higher than a brick and mortar bank as well. I can access my information 24 hours a day as well.

The rates during ING Direct days were very competitive but since Capital One bought them out it's been going downhill, granted it's the fed rate lowering it's rates. The rate was at 0.75 for many years until recent raised to 1.00 which is still below fed rate, which is currently at 1.5%. The competitors such as Discover and American Express have been steadily moving up with the fed rate so I would recommend them before considering 360. Thought I do like the 360 checking which pays at 0.20, which isn't the best but at least they pay something for that.",2018-02-15

The only problem with banking this way is there are no ATMs to make cash withdrawals without being charged. Other than that, I love mobile banking and not having to go to a physical location to take care of my banking. I can do my banking when it's convenient and from anywhere in the world.",2018-02-13
421,"Compared to other online only banks, probably the best out there.",31744,20928,Capital One,47810,4,I started using this bank to transfer my earnings after spending a few years on American Express.I have to say that it's only been about a year since I switched but I wouldn't go back for anything. Capital One doesn't charge monthly fees and I even earn a small amount of interest on the money that I keep in the account. I haven't had any issues as far as money randomly disappearing from my account or odd emails about the account like other people seem to get from other banks. I haven't had to contact support for anything so I don't know how that end is but all in all I have had nothing but a pleasant experience with Capital One and I would suggest them to anyone.,2018-02-13
422,Capital One 360 Online Savings Acct,31689,20928,Capital One,47715,5,I use Capital One 360 Online Savings account and like it a lot. I originally was looking for a savings account that would give me a higher interest rate than my current bank and when I found it. the 360 savings account offered a higher interest rate and had no minimum balance to keep. The were also no fees at all attached to the account. It was really easy to create an account and link it to your existing banking accounts. You just had to verify the amount of 2 small deposits made into the original account by capital one. After that you are free to transfer money into and out of the account either online or with the mobile app. Both are very easy and to the point to use. They give you a card so you can withdraw from your online savings account from any capital one atms. I would recommend this online savings account to anyone.,2018-02-09
423,Fine Service But Interest Rates Are Lower Now,31822,20928,Capital One,47970,4,"I came to Capital one when they bought ING Direct. They don't offer the same great rates as ING Direct, so I'm moving most funds elsewhere. At present it's Capital one 0.8% on savings vs up to 1.6% elsewhere. I don't much like the super-spare new Capital one website, but had no contact with customer service over the years. I'll keep account open in hopes they'll get competitive rates again.",2018-02-08

425,Capital One 360 Checking Account,31472,20928,Capital One,47571,4,"So far it has been smooth sailing with my capital one 360 account. I really love that it's free to withdraw money from any ATM. A lot of times banks will charge you a fee, but it was a really nice surprise to see that capital one 360 does not charge you this fee. Other than that, I have also set up direct deposit with Capital One 360. In my experience with regular banks, I had a lot of trouble finding my account number. Unless you have checks or paperwork with that account number, it was impossible to find-even if I called the bank!! Capital One 360 shows you your account number and routing number right on their mobile webpage and their app. It made it so convenient for me to set up direct deposit with my job. I really love the easy banking experience.. hopefully I don't have any issues and need to call customer service- but so far I haven't even needed to.",2018-02-03
426,Capital One 360 Summary,31425,20928,Capital One,47480,4,My experience with Capital One 360 has been overall very good. I originally joined the bank when I moved overseas because of the lack of transaction fees when transferring USD to EUR. Additionally it was extremely easy and cheap to transfer money from one Capital One 360 account to another. I could even do this from my phone. The mobile banking app is very easy to use and has no learning curve. I can't say much about customer service because I never needed to contact customer service which is a good thing.,2018-01-31
427,Great way to start saving and start a credit history,31414,20928,Capital One,47470,5,"I started banking with Capital One 360 4 or 5 years ago. The process is extremely easy and they don't require a minimum to start saving and you can have several accounts with them and they offer a great rate. Also, I obtained a credit card with them and they have helped me to build my credit. They have great app features where you can check your own credit and stay on top of things with credit report. i am extremely satisfied with Capital One.",2018-01-29
428,My Experiences with Capital One 360,31389,20928,Capital One,47403,4,"I started online banking with ING Direct, which was purchased by Capital One, when it became Capital One 360. I have both multiple savings and a checking account with them and I have been extremely happy with the experience. It is very easy to initially set up an account. Once a main account is set up, it's quick and easy to set up other accounts. What I find most helpful is the ability to set up multiple savings accounts and set up transfers to and from those accounts for specific savings goals (like an emergency fund). I also use those savings accounts as ""buckets"" to pay my various bills. Transferring money to and from these accounts to other external accounts is straight forward, though, it can take anywhere from 2 - 5 days for the money to arrive, depending on the entity. They also provide a minimal number checks for FREE! The only negatives are the interest rates are fairly low (though, it is nice to get anything on a checking account) and a recent redesign of the main page is not as helpful or clean as the previous layout. Otherwise, I'm completely happy with Capital One 360 and plan on staying with them in the long term.",2018-01-29
429,It's an Online Bank,31387,20928,Capital One,47401,4,"The Capital One Banking app is an easy why to access the services of Capital One. It is easy for me to manage the its funds and move them to other accounts as I need, as well as deposit funds from my phone. I wish their customer service was as easy to work with as the app. The one time I needed to call, to verify a missing mobile deposit, they were rude and treated me like I was trying to pull one over on them. After asking to speak to this person's supervisor, my question was quickly answered, and my deposit was completed.",2018-01-29
430,Capitol One 360,31363,20928,Capital One,47361,4,"I have had a Capitol One 360 checking account for a little over two years now. I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience as a customer. Anytime that I have had a problem, which has always been minor, they have been able to address it very quickly. There are no fees associated with the account and it even draws interest, although in my case very little, which I also like very much. The only complaint that I have about Capitol One is that there are no physical locations anywhere near me. This is pretty expected with an online institution though. I do like that I can do a mobile check deposit with my phone. I just wish there was a way to deposit cash into an ATM since I am a server and generally deal with cash more often than checks. All in all, I am very satistified with them as a bank and plan to stay a customer for a long time.",2018-01-27
431,Capital One 360 Bank,31356,20928,Capital One,47354,2,"My husband and I opened a checking account with them because of the bonus and low fees they were willing to offer. This was our first time using a online banking and It did not last long because unlike a physical bank there was no feeling of community or belonging. To be frank, I think this took way for the actual services provided. My experience with customer service was fine but nothing exceptional. With this bank nothing stood out or compelled us to keep the account open and we also never received any bonus for opening up the bank account to begin with. I would recommend this bank to someone who travels a lot over maybe for someone oversea since finding your bank out of state can sometimes be difficult.",2018-01-26
432,Good bank,31098,20928,Capital One,46753,4,"I joined the bank because they had a promotion to give each person a free credit to his or her account. Each person having an account was given the promotional bonus. The interest rates as well were higher than your typical brick and mortar bank down the street. I joined about 6 years ago and have had no problems. The money is secure in the bank and free to use. There are no hidden charges for my savers accounts and none added in all those years. They don't swamp me with emails of unnecessary products. Any time I had questions, they were easily answered online. I have been able to access all my account deposits and transactions easily online with no hassle. The website is secure and easy to find what I need.",2018-01-18

I was on hold for 2 hours and transferred 5 times. I was asked countless security questions, and answered each one correctly. However, then I was transferred again to another person, and the call was dropped during the transfer. My account balance is $0. I have filed a complaint against the bank with the Federal Reserve. All I want to do is close my account.",2018-01-05
434,Capital One Meets My Needs,30975,20928,Capital One,46611,3,"I signed up with Capital One last year because my old local brick bank was rejecting my electronic deposits. Calling was a waste of time, as they never answered after a very long wait on hold. After visiting my bank and getting bad information I decided to look in to online banks, with the idea of transferring deposits to my old bank. I chose Capital One after a co-worker suggested it. I signed up within minutes and had my first electronic deposit within days. My card also arrived within days and there was no fee for it, and I was told I could also print checks if necessary. All free! I had one problem early on and this issue was resolved within minutes on the phone. It was my own confusion, not a problem with the bank. I am so pleased with this account I have completely stopped using my old brick bank. My old bank charged a fee every month. Capital One does not, so this was a very pleasant feature. In one year I have not had a single problem on their end. I would recommend them to anyone.",2018-01-05
435,Great Bank when it was ING,30927,20928,Capital One,46467,3,"We had an account with ING Direct. It was a really great experience. The bank was very responsive, the CSRs were all native English speakers, the rates were competitive, especially for CDs. In fact, they made it very easy to ladder CDs. So we really enjoyed ING. Then, however, for some reason, they were acquired by Capital One. We still have a bank account with Capital One (in addition to our credit cards), but the service level is just not great. The worst is that it seems to be almost impossible to actually get someone on the phone, and they almost seem to discourage additional banking instruments, like CDs and IRAs. So, they are much more basic. We still have money left there, but we aren't really using the account for anything but basic savings, as a place to keep money before we can properly invest it.",2018-01-01
436,Capital One has way lower fees,30873,20928,Capital One,46412,3,"I have really enjoyed Capital One banking. The fees are reasonable, and they don't crush people with overdraft fees. I have gotten used to not having a branch, and there are plenty of fee-free ATMS. Direct deposit works as well as any other bank. The only suggestion I'd have is to shorten the amount of time it takes for a mobile deposit of a paper check to clear. My last bank did it next day for free with a small fee to deposit immediately. It takes three or four days with Capital One, which could be too long if I needed the money right away. I got checks quickly, and the check card came right away, plus bill pay is free. I would highly recommend using Capital One for cheaper banking. I will stay with them a long time.",2017-12-24
437,Used To Be Great...Not So Much Anymore,30810,20928,Capital One,46260,3,"I have had my checking and saving accounts for over 10 years, back when it used to be ING. The customer service has been top notch. They changed their website recently and really dropped the ball. The online help used to be very robust, now it is almost non existent. Simple functions like canceling a recurring transfer now have to be done by calling customer service which takes forever to answer. I expressed my frustration with the loss of functionality on the website to be told that millennials love the new website. I think that was their way of telling me that I would like the change if I was under 40. It's not the design change, it's the loss of functionality. Do younger people enjoy the loss of functionality??? There is no was to give them feedback on their website. Even though they have a feedback link, it does not work since the link has been disabled.",2017-12-17

I primarily used the Capital One account to save for an engagement ring. I set up an automatic deduction from my Chase account for $100 per week to go into the 360 account. Additionally, I would also transfer money on occasion to help pad the 360 account. I rarely, if ever, used the 360 account for spending, until I actually purchased the engagement ring. I never had any issues or negative experiences with the 360 account, and I really liked the credit monitoring aspect in the app.<br/> <br/>I have since discontinued using the Capital One 360 account, in favor of a joint Ally savings account, which earns us a higher interest rate.

You can do it all online. I like that there are no hidden fees. I don't have to have any minimum balance in my account. Setting up direct deposit is very quick. I can easily speak to customer service online or by making a quick phone call. My only complaint is that when I opened a checking account, they didn't automatically receive a debit card.

443,Capital One Bank experience,30510,20928,Capital One,45440,4,"I was looking for another bank in addition to my primary bank, I wanted to looking something with a much better online presence and something with a decent mobile app. I did some research on several websites comparing online banks such as moneyunder30 and nerdwallet, sources that I have used for other personal finance questions. I ended up with top 3 candidates, Simple Bank, Capital One and Ally Bank. Many of these banks I have seen on advertisements and heard testimonies from other people, so the name recognition from these 3 banks were very familiar to me. I did some research and ended up deciding to go with Capital One Bank because they had good reviews with customer service and a user friendly website and mobile app. They also had the best interest rates for checking accounts and saving accounts. One thing that put Capitial One over the top for me was their referral program and that they added $25 dollars for depositing a certain amount of money into their checking accounts, which ended up being the deciding factor. So far, no problems or issues with the online bank, I even went on their official twitter page asking when do their bank statements become available, and they answered me in the morning of the next day. So far, good rates and no problems, and the website is very easy to use. I greatly enjoyed my experience with online banking and think this is the way things will be done in the future.",2017-11-26
444,Capital One 360 - best savings account ever,30495,20928,Capital One,45425,4,"I created a savings account 10 years ago with an online only bank called INGDirect. That was bought and turned into Capital one 360 but the idea is the same - it's an online only bank so I cannot easily withdraw money or use in person services, but my interest rate is much more competitive compared to brick and mortar banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, etc. I chose to use this institution because of the interest rate provided in my savings account. I had a less then .1% interest rate in my Wells Fargo account, and ING was advertising over 1% interest. This is a substantial number for a savings account and I believe only online banks are really offering these kinds of numbers. My service expectation is low with an online savings account, because I don't need much. For that reason it seems to be a great fit.",2017-11-25

Back in 2014 they merged with Capital One and became Capital One 360. I decided to stay with them and see how things went. I've been extremely pleased with all services that I've received. I manage everything through my app or online. I get set up payment schedules, money transfers and check balances almost instantly. I've never experienced any down at all. I've only ever had to call customer service and that was only because I locked my account after forgetting my password had special characters in it. The person I spoke was super sweet, very knowledgeable and incredibly helpful. I have local atm's where I can go and deposit cash if I need to. They're not specifically capital one atm's, but they do accept their deposits which makes it extremely helpful when I have cash to put in. My only complaint is that automatic transfers from my other bank account take a little longer then I'd like to so show up. Normally transfers take 24hrs, but this takes about 48hrs.

They had a promotion at the time for $500 if you start a new account and deposit $50,000 or more. My money was sitting in a regular bank untouched with practically no interest at Chase so I thought it was worth switching. It was easy to set up the account online and complete all the necessary verification. As promised, the promotion bonus money was deposited to my account after 90 days. The interest rate is in line with what other banks are offering now and there are no monthly fees. This money is my savings that I do not intend to touch until I buy a home so I rarely use their online banking services. But so far my experience with Capital One has been easy and good.",2017-11-20

Right now I am getting 1.3% on my money market and i can do what I please with my money. What has made this really easy is that transfers are free so I every month i plop savings into it. Also free are the mobile check deposit, so i dont need to worry about going to a bank to deposit a check, it just goes right into the account.

Though interest rates are not that great (no bank is), it is better than any brick and mortar establishment. In fact, interest rates continue to increase and not decrease like most banks. Their checking is free and also pays interest. They have lots of 3rd party ATMs, so when I need cash, finding one is not a problem. There is no ATM fee. I like the ability to create multiple accounts to help keep funds separated for different purposes. Checks are available for manually writing payments, or you can use online payment transfers. Money can also be deposited via ACH transfers. When making large check deposits, your money is only held for a few days prior to becoming available.

It is extremely easy to do online transactions, and I don't ever have to go to a brick and mortar bank because of the convenience online. I don't have to wait in any lines which is great when you have children (minus the no lollipop factor).

I enjoy using them for my banking needs. I can deposit all of my checks using there mobile app so not having a local branch is not really an issue for me. The only time I do not like it is when I have cash that I would like to deposit. I would like it a lot more if I could go to an ATM and deposit my cash that way but unfortunately that is not an option. Usually I just hold onto the cash and spend it that way.

I am able to see both my Savings and Checking accounts with there respective transactions over time. I can also select different dates for any report that I might need. At the same time I can see various other products that the bank offers. The one issue I have with using the online banking is that over the weekend it is slow to update. In balances and posted transactions don't clear till Tuesday. This means that purchases Friday evening aren't finalized till Tuesday. Having transactions take half the week to clear can be kind of a pain when there is a large number of transactions. Most do show up in pending status but not always.,2017-11-09

I've never had a single problem with Capital One 360, despite the fact that it's online-only and there are no local branches to which I can go in person if I have a concern. The interest rate I get on my savings account is extremely competitive -- while it's not the very highest out there anymore, it's still miles better than the rates I can get locally. It's also very easy to move money into and out of the account, and to withdraw cash when necessary. I don't have to keep a ridiculous amount of money in my checking account to avoid high fees. The only concern I ever had was when I tried to connect the account to my PayPal account and PayPal refused it. However, that was due to PayPal's unreasonable rules about online banks, so I can't blame Capital One 360 for it.",2017-11-07

I can easily transfer between the two as well as pay bills and transfer to one of my accounts in a brick and mortar bank. One of the features I liked was that for me having a portion of my money ""out of sight"" was a bonus, it forced me to save, much like a Christmas savings account. If money wasn't in my general checking account, then I seemed to be able to ""forget it"" and accrue savings quicker.

They have online chat to help if you run into any problems or have questions, but it was so simple I think anyone could do it as easily as I did. I love that I am able to access all my financial information online. It is simple to see what checks and deposit have cleared. I also get my monthly statement emailed to me, so there is no waiting on it to show up in the mail. Probably the best part of my online checking account is the mobile app. This makes it easy to bank anywhere since I always have my phone with me. I can deposit checks, transfer money, and check balances anywhere. I can also find a local brick and mortar bank or ATM if I need one.

I don't need to call the bank before I use it abroad. Customer service was far better than my old bank, wells fargo, with no fees.

459,Great Online Bank Experience at Capital One 360,30099,20928,Capital One,44470,5,"I have been using Capital One 360 online banking for over ten years (since when it was ING Direct). It has always been a great banking experience. The website is very clear and user friendly. The one or two times I've had questions that I couldn't answer by myself online, I had a great customer service experience over the phone. I've been able to order checks easily, and if I need a canceled check to set up direct deposit for work, I can print one easily. I can also transfer money from my checking to savings account (and vice-versa) with ease. Sending money to friends or family is a breeze. The mobile app also makes depositing checks fast, safe, and simple. I have used other online banking systems, and none have been as user friendly as Capital One 360.",2017-10-30
460,Capital One - once was ING Direct still is great.,30064,20928,Capital One,44390,5,"Capital One 360 - which was once ING Direct - took over and I thought I would hate it. Well, nope. They took over in name alone and everything essentially remains the same. They are still the best bank to deal with. Fees are so very fair and reasonable. They are willing to work with you to resolve issues and they make that process so very easy. My only real complaint is the fact that there are no local ATMs so getting cash means acquiring a fee from the ATM (not Capital one, thankfully). But, that aside, it is a really fine bank to work with. Customer service is great. Everyone who works there is easy going and polite. They definitely seem like the best bank to deal with. I really don't intend on leaving anytime soon.",2017-10-26
461,I love Capital One 360,30018,20928,Capital One,44300,5,"I opened a checking account with Capital One 360 a number of years ago. I have had nothing but great experiences with this institution. They offer very good interest rates for checking and savings accounts. When I needed customer service help about my atm and pin number, I was able to get the issue resolved over the phone. The app works well for depositing checks. I've never had any negative experiences. I also opened a savings account when they had a promotion and earned a nice bonus that way. I would recommend Capital One 360.",2017-10-23
462,A real penny saver,30017,20928,Capital One,44299,4,"Capital one 360 is a online only bank. While there are a lot of online only bank service providers, very few of them are well credited like capital one 360. I also like its app interface, which is colorful and easy to read, and the check-deposit functionality is really neat. And because it is still an online bank, you can use a lot of ATM's with discount on fee. Their online bank(browser version) is very neat, too, with online statement available 24/7. Highly recommended to all who are looking for a good online-only bank.",2017-10-23

Without having a local branch office, I was not tempted to withdraw funds. Unfortunately CapitalOne Bank also saw the value in INGDirect and bought them out. Now, years later, with the product renamed to the confusing CapitalOne 360, I was forced to change from a keypad PIN and image icon to a password. I felt that this was less secure. Also, the interest rates have been abysmal with no chance of growth. INGDirect had higher savings rates because they did not have a lot of overhead. CapitalOne 360 feels like I circled back to square one.",2017-10-23

This account is completely free and doesn't charge any overdraft fees. They offer a line of credit as their overdraft protection which helps me tremendously. I can also make deposits and withdrawals from the ATM which is a huge help to me because I do my banking after hours, on the weekends, and on holidays or Sundays. Capital One even offers free service at some of the other ATMs where I live as well so that I don't have to drive to the main branch here in Paris. Overall, they sold me on there ""100% free checking"" slogan that they use. It really is 100% free. no surprise or hidden fees.",2017-10-08

My local bank closed the branch closest to me and I now had to drive twice as far every week just for deposits alone. I started looking into online banking. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how competitive and easy it is. The customer service was excellent and the convenience was great . The fees are similar and it's very secure. I now have my checking account,savings account,CDs and a college fund for my grandchildren,all with Capital One online banking. I highly recommend Capital One for all banking needs.

The usability and overall experience did not change once the merger occurred. The sign up process and general usability of moving money to and from my other accounts was seamless. <br/> <br/>I generally use this account for long term bills such as insurance premiums and taxes that I may incur at the end of the year. <br/> <br/>The account itself was reliant on the federal government's interest rate, which as we all know fluctuates throughout the year. I think the nicest thing about how the account and interface was setup was showing the monthly compounded interest in a well displayed manner along with my total balances and deposits for any given month.<br/> <br/>I still use this service to this day and have been a customer for the past 10 years.",2017-10-06

It took 2-3 days to arrive. I transferred some money from this account to another bank and it again took 2-3 days to complete. When I asked for some personal checks, they sent me 50 checks free of charge. They did not charge me with anything for any of the processes. Overall, I am happy with this service.",2017-10-06
468,I enjoy using my online bank!,29690,20928,Capital One,43432,4,"I have used an online bank for more than ten years. I use an online bank for a basic savings account and for certificates of deposits, and I have been very happy with it's performance over the years. While I am not happy that there was a merger a few years back, it hasn't decreased the quality of service I have received. I began using it for the higher rates and the sign up bonuses, but it has become a major factor of convenience for me as I do not often have time to make it to the bricks and mortar banks now that I have two kids. I did have a checking account through them, but I did not keep it; since I need a B&M bank anyway, I need to keep a specific balance in that account in order to keep it fee-free which made the checking account pretty useless. One added bonus from using this online bank is that I have not received multiple offers for services that I do not use, which is not exactly an expected side effect, but I appreciate having less junk (paper and email) to sort through.",2017-10-05
469,Long Time Customer Leaving,29853,20928,Capital One,43783,1,"I've been a customer since ING Direct and Capital One 360 is my primary bank and I do all of my banking online. They have recently updated their interface to look more like the app. In doing so they have eliminated functionality (like the ability to deposit checks on the website without having to download the app) and there are serious performance issues. I would say more than 50% of the time over the last month or two I can see what accounts I have and the balances but am unable to click in and see what my transaction actually were. It either ""spins"" indefinitely or I get an actual error. I also realized how tough it is to actually get service when needed. ""Go to a branch"" isn't an option since there are none anywhere near me. Today was the last straw when again I could not access my accounts and would like to pay bills. I have submitted to open accounts at a new bank.",2017-10-02

It is fee free and they will actually pay you $50 after you make a deposit and make three small purchases. If I ever had a problem like when my account was hacked they fixed it right of way. The android app is great and you can deposit checks on there. Also Capital One owns sharbuilder.com and if you make a account with them and buy one single stock at any price they will give $50 for that to. I plan on staying with Capital One forever.,2017-10-01

I was issued free checks, so that is good to have around for just in case times. I appreciate the ease of the online website to find everything that I am looking for and know that there is a chat box that I can get right to someone if the need arises to talk to a person.

At the time, neither of us had the best credit history, and we thought we would try our luck at being accepted for an online bank. At the time, I had only ever dealt with brick-and-mortar banks but we applied for the CaptialOne360 online savings account and were accepted. We were able to do transfers from our credit union checking account every time we were paid at work and it was simple to get the money into the online account. The difficult part was the withdraw process. As the wedding date drew near and we had to pay the various wedding contracts (flowers, caterer, photographer), we had to plan it for the extra 2-3 days to get the money transferred into our account. It was very frustrating when we needed to write a check and could not have access to our money the next business day.<br/> <br/>In the end, we closed the account after our wedding day and never looked back. At the time, it was nice to have a bank give us a chance when we were repairing our credit, but it was not fun waiting 48-72 hours to get our money out of the online savings account. I would not do it again if there were wait-times similar to this still in effect.",2017-09-20

The reason I signed up was because they were offering a free account with no fees. Since then, ING was bought by Capital One bank and now my accounts are under Capital One. This was a great change because now I have access to Capital One ATM's as well as other perks offered by Capital One Bank like their advanced security features. My accounts are still free like they used to be when they were under ING so long as I don't go into the bank and use a teller. I do all my banking through their mobile application which allows me to handle almost all my banking needs (deposits/transfers/bill payments). Doing my banking online is so much better than having to drive down to a bank and stand in a line. I really can't imagine going back to the way I used to handle my banking needs. The only problem I can see people having is when it comes to depositing cash. If you don't live next to your bank's ATM then this might be an issue for some.",2017-09-17

Unfortunately, ING Direct is no longer in operation in this way, and, one day, the online entity simply ""became"" Capital One 360. After the switch from ING Direct to Capital One 360, nothing fundamental changed with any of my savings accounts, and I still continue to save for future financial needs in this way.<br/> <br/>What I like most about Capital One 360 is that I can create/open as many different savings accounts as I think that I will need, and give each one a unique nickname, so I will know exactly how all of my savings funds are allocated.

When I finally got in, I noticed right off the bat that something was very fishy. Website looked totally different from previous one. No dates and not even name of account holder. I printed out all the pages and also screenshot them. As soon as I logged out, I received Email from CPO 360, saying ""The phone number for your Capital One VISA SIGNATURE has been updated"" First of all, we don't have VISA SIGNATURE CARD, and Email was sent to my husband, even though I was the one that logged in using my own password.<br/><br/>We have $50000.00 in CD for 5 years, APY 2.25%, but I take interest out each month, therefore a little less than 2.25%. I set up the way money goes to Savings when CD matures. but this information has been deleted by CPO 360. CPO 360 tried to stop us from taking interest out, but they couldn't. They came up with tricky and illegitimate way to stop us now. Few months ago, 360 in red and round shape of logo on checking account, when I click on it, it says ""This account is the current default checking account for this card"" This card means VISA SIGNATURE Card that CPO created without our permission, on top of this, our Debit Cards have been cancelled.<br/>There is no monetary damage yet, but I'm aware of what may come later. Recently, I purchased decent recorder and I let them know being recorded. Phone was rigging about 5 minutes before someone answered, this is unprecedented too. I even recorded waiting time too. Debit cards will be renewed, and I should receive confirmation letter of CD maturity option I selected. I'll give them only one week before I file a complaint through CFPB.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, if you have an account for simple daily use, not taking money out often, you might be OK. Just be very careful, CPO 360 is the most beguiled bank that I had to deal with so far, even before aforementioned happened. This is my second writing on this bank.",2017-09-08

Capital One has officially gained a loyal customer for caring about my safety. I honestly appreciate that. Anyone else would have probably been annoyed, but it was certainly a reminder for me to focus on the road. Secondly, I love my credit card. It's great for beginners, just be sure to pay more than the minimum amount! Increase your spending limit when you can and always keep your spending below 25%. This helps increase you credit score!

I was drawn to their service because of a very high interest rate on savings accounts (somewhere around 5-6% at the time). Since then, ING was bought out and the interest rate has fallen dramatically, but is still much better than I have seen with traditional brick and mortar banks. I still have automatic deposits scheduled with them, and have been saving with ING/Capitol One for 10 years in a row.

The experience has been good, direct deposits from my employer show up before 7:00AM on pay day, and I've never had any issues that required me to have to contact customer service.<br/> <br/>The mobile check deposit feature in their Android app works great.

The biggest downside is that I have no physical bank to visit. There is no service charge and no minimum balance requirement. It also earns a very small interest rate. It is easy to use this checking account for ordering items online. Usually I use the check card for buying gas or groceries but also have paper checks. As long as I have access to WiFi I can check my account balance any time. I can also print off statements. It is not possible for me to make cash deposits to the account. I have used customer service very little, but it was satisfactory by making a phone call. It may take a couple of days for money to transfer to this account.

They have helped me exponentially grow my financial nest egg and they have also provided me with the knowledge, discipline, and mental strength necessary to save my money in investments when both the market is booming and doing great or when the market is collapsing or correcting. This type of Financial Advisement has allowed me to gain peace of mind, calmness, and feeling secure that my money is in great and responsible hands.

It was the first time I'd ever seen a bank where instead of dinging your account a huge fee when you overdraft, they instead essentially loan you a certain amount of money and you pay a couple pennies at the end of the month. I don't make much, so every now and again that ends up quite literally saving my bacon. Despite this, I'm never treated as lesser by the company - any questions or needs that I have are met in a friendly, open way. I once typo'd a transfer amount, making it something like 100 dollars instead of 10, and called them up. The problem was handled over the course of a 15 minute phone call, and next to none of that time was spent on hold. Capital One 360 is definitely a place I'd recommend, for anybody who needs a bank.

485,Capital One Online Bank,28969,20928,Capital One,41795,4,"Originally, I began banking online with a company called ING Direct in 2006. At the time they offered the highest interest rate for savings and cd accounts. Around 2012, Capital One bought out ING Direct and my account transferred to them. The transition was very smooth and the online site has been easy to use. I am able to still have my checking account at another bank linked to my savings account. I am able to transfer funds between the two easily though not necessarily quickly. It always takes 48 hours to transfer funds. Since the takeover, the interest rates have been o.k. but not as good as they had been with ING Direct. Capital One does offer multiple options for cds and varying interest rates. They also offer checking accounts and money market accounts. I do not have experience with their checking accounts and money market accounts but I have looked into opening those types of accounts. The online checking account does not have any fees associated with it and appears to be easy to setup and use. I have not had a lot of experience in dealing with the customer service department simply because I have never needed to call. I have never had any issues with my online banking experience in the 5 years that I have been with Capital One. The only time I have needed to contact them was to update my last name when I got married and my address when I moved. Capital One has always been quick to respond and gives me the information I need right away. I would definitely recommend banking with them.

I don't yet consider them wholly on par with a brick-and-mortar bank as of yet. There is something comforting about having a building that you can go to, but in general I've been satisfied with the experience.

If I ever had to call them I got someone on the line right away. It is the same way with Capital One. If you call them, they will be right on the line with you and be very pleasant. I have had to deal with BoA on the phone and it was a horrible experience. Captial One is great. Their checking account pay 0.25 percent interest (adjusts as the fed rate adjusts). It isn't much but it's something. Their savings account pays 0.75 percent interest. I do wish that was a bit more now that fed rates are rising. SOmething like 1 or 1.25 percent would really make it stand out. It is very easy to deposit checks via mobile phone pictures. I do it all the time.

I have checking, savings and an IRA account and am happy with all three. <br/>I originally got the account as a way to pay bills on time when I was traveling for work a lot. In recent years I travel less often, but I have moved cities several times and it is a joy just to avoid having to get a new bank every time I move. It is hard for anyone who's never done it to imagine the inconvenience of having to close one checking account down while waiting for everything to clear and hope that you never write a check on the wrong account!<br/>I love the bill paying application with this account. I not only get monthly statements for most vendors right in my checking account, I can easily see recent and pending transactions and set up reminders.  <br/>The savings account is also great. I can set up subfolders for specific savings goals which lets me keep my 'emergency fund' separate from money I'm squirreling away for a vacation or other goal.<br/>Transfers between savings and checking happen immediately, so I never have to worry about bouncing a check.<br/>I'm even able to attach an external account so I can easily transfer money to a local account where I do keep a small amount of funds in case I need cash fast. (The one drawback to my online account compared to brick and mortar is that there are only a few nearby ATMs and they are not on the most widely used network. So to avoid ATM fees or being stuck if one is out of service, I keep a local checking account. This also comes in handy if I run across someone who is uncomfortable taking a check from an online bank. It's only happened once, but it can happen.)<br/> <br/>My work does not offer direct deposit. It's so nice on payday to complete my deposit in 2 minutes with my phone. My coworkers spend half their lunch hour driving to the bank, waiting in line to deposit their checks. I never stand in line and I've yet to have a check take more than 48 hours to clear and become available.<br/> <br/>I really love this way of banking. I was worried about losing some quality in customer service or value each time the bank changed hands, but I have to say I have not seen a problem.",2017-08-10
492,CapOne 360: Good for what it is,28762,20928,Capital One,41328,3,"I have both a Capital One 360 checking and savings account. It is an online-only bank and I have these accounts as a compliment to my main Barclays account. I like having the back-up account option and it is also a good place to squirrel away money when you're looking to save and almost want to forget about it - hence I autodraft out of my Barclays into my Capital One savings account. <br/> <br/>Overall, the account is helpful. Their website is pretty good, although not spectacular and their customer service is pretty standard. This is not an account that will blow you away or anything, but it is still a reliable and easy option. I would definitely recommend this service to anyone looking to start up a side account or maybe a young person who just needs a starter account. No complaints here.",2017-08-08
493,My review,28731,20928,Capital One,41288,4,Capital One has allowed me to bank with higher interest rates on my savings accounts and with lower banking fees. It is easy to check my balances and transfer funds online. I am also able to transfer money into the account from other bank accounts with ease. I enjoy that there are no fees or minimum balance requirements such as those from other banking institutions. I believe since they use only online banking; that they can offer higher interest rates because of less capital required to pay for employees in traditional banking branches. I would recommend considering this online bank for your banking needs if you do not require a traditional banking branch office location. They offer free ATM services at certain network linked ATM machines.,2017-08-06
494,Capital One 360- Easy to Use,28728,20928,Capital One,41285,4,"I originally opened a Capital One 360 savings account because I got an offer in the mail for a monetary bonus if I opened the account with $10,000 in it. I wanted the free money so I figured I'd give it a try. I didn't have high expectations because the bank is completely online and I wasn't sure how deposits and such would work. That was about 6 years ago and the account is still open and active. In addition to standard interest, the account earns quarterly bonuses as well as an annual bonus depending on the amount of money in the account. It's not a lot of money but it's better than what the local banks offer. The money is easy to access- it takes about 3 days to transfer it into my local account. This is good because it prevents me from mindlessly spending my savings (since there's no debit card or anything) but it's liquid for when I need it, like when I needed a down for buying my car. I have a credit card with Capital One as well and I like that I can log into the 360 account but see my credit card balance as well. Overall, easy to use and I would recommend to others.",2017-08-06

I knew that they would protect me if I ever had a problem. I get direct deposit for my salary check every two weeks so it is easy to pay any bills I have.<br/>I have used the Master card sparingly over the years because I didn't want to add to my debt ratio. But a few months ago I made a larger purchase. The transaction went through fine, but they did call me to make sure it was me doing the purchase. I thought that was very helpful, because it that wasn't me they could have stopped fraud right away, which I like.",2017-08-05

The security team they have is garbage complete garbage for the one you cant even speak to someone directly they have to give you a call back when its convenient for them. Also, they froze my account not letting anything go out, but whats funny is stuff can still go in lol. That right there just shows how money hungry they are if there really was an issue with my account why are you letting deposits go in??? Its because the longer they hold my money, and don't send me a check for whats in my bank account the more money they make off the interest in the accounts.

497,Cash Accessibility and Online Banking,28392,20928,Capital One,40271,3,"After too many fees with a large, corner-store style chain bank, I decided to try online only banking with Capital One. I opened 3 checking accounts so that I could keep my money separated for budgeting purposes. All was well and good as long as all transactions were completed online, which the majority are for me. However, one incident arose where I needed fast access to a large amount of cash. I had the cash in my account already, so I just needed to withdraw it. Seeing as an online bank does not have physical locations, I was forced to use the services of another bank. I looked up the ATMs that did not have fees with this account. I went to one of them, tried to use it, and was informed via phone call that I could not withdraw that much money from an ATM. The caller then told me about the process of going in to a physical bank and withdrawing cash from my account with a debit card. I was told this would work since I had my ID to show to the bank. Well, you guessed, it did not work. It turns out that Capital One had put a 24 hour non-removable hold on my account for trying to access cash (even though they called and confirmed my identity). After that, I stopped using online only banking and now use credit unions. While my need to access cash is rare, I feel I should have access to my cash at any point I need it, to be determined by me, not by the bank.",2017-07-31
498,Good online banking experience,28329,20928,Capital One,40175,5,Approximately a year ago I decided to open a Capital One 360 online account. I have nothing but praise to give about the experience. I have been able to easily attach different accounts and I also have a debit card that I have used. The account charges absolutely NO fees and provides interest if you can believe that. I have been able to use the account to pay bills as well. Very well worth the move. I would highly recommend this service to anyone who likes the banking remotely mode. Sometimes you experience more privacy when your bank is not located where people know who you are. That does not mean I have anything to hide.,2017-07-24
499,Good Online Banking for Frequent Travelers,28322,20928,Capital One,40168,4,"I am very pleased with my online banking experience with my Capital One 360 checking/savings account. I originally signed up for this online bank account because I needed a reliable and easy way to access my money when I was traveling overseas for 3 months. The Capital One 360 account doesn't charge any international fees, which was one of the main reasons why I chose to bank with them. It was easy to log into my online account to keep updated with the status of my account and how much money I had left. I found the website itself easy to use with a good interface. They also do not charge a monthly fee, though there is an overdraft fee if you overdraw (something that I make sure never to do). I liked that I could also easily transfer money to my online account from other sources.",2017-07-20
500,Nice experience,28305,20928,Capital One,40151,4,"Banking with Capital One 360 has been an exercise in patience and a joy. So concerned with security are they that often your online purchases will be blocked despite disabling that feature. Even if you have called and informed them of your pending trip out of the state. However to benefit of banking with Capital one 360 is the lack of fees. I am a former employee of Wells Fargo and I have seen the ugliness of overdraft fees. The bank will not honor or charge you should something try to enter your account- and that makes life way easier. Customers with decent credit can choose to have an overdraw credit and pay interest alone on it, which is remarkably low. So this bank will not attempt to take away money you don't have. Overall I have found the normal daily banking to be exceptional with a few hitches at times with security and communication.",2017-07-16
501,Online Banking For The Busy Person,28275,20928,Capital One,40066,4,"Capital One 360 (Formerly ING) is a solid online bank. I have a checking, savings, money market account, and a CD through Capital One 360. (I was pleasantly surprised that opening a CD did not cost a lot of money and every 6 months, I can roll it over with interest into another CD. There are so many options - it is a PLUS). <br/>However, I was skeptical when they merged with ING, but I have been pleasantly surprised! I am able to navigate my backing options easily and transfer money as needed. The platform/website is easy to navigate and I have been able to contact customer service when I needed to. I even opened an IRA and it was very easy and painless. The great thing about Capital One 360 is that I can make mobile deposits - it is super easy and very convenient. If you are a busy person like I am and don't have time to go to the bank - Capital One is a great bank to have. From the customer care representative who helped me when I had a merchant over charge me to the ease of navigating the website and controlling my money, Capital One is a great way to bank and also to save.",2017-07-14

Well it just happens to be that that month was finally up and I still had not been credited that bonus so I called customer service and they mentioned that unless I received a letter in the mail inviting me to open the account that the bonus didn't really count. I asked why they were promoting false advertisement online and they mentioned that In the smallest fine print it read that the bonus only applied to people who received the invitation by mail. My question is WHY ARE YOU ADVERTISING THIS ONLINE IF IT ONLY APPLIES BY MAIL AND INVITATION. This is one of the biggest scams I've ever been involved in by a credit company.",2017-07-09

I first opened an account with capital one as a way to cut down on fees that my traditional brick and mortar bank was charging me. Due to the efficiency of online systems, CapitalOne has some of the lowest rates available for opening a checking and savings account. My card arrived within days of setting up my account and all of my banking can be accomplished easily online through my browser. They also have great functionality through mobile app usage. The app I use on my iphone was simple to install and is very user friendly. Making deposits, transferring money and checking my balances can all be accomplished within minutes. I have also been very pleased with the customer service offered. I have only had to contact my bank once for assistance, and the staff on the phone were very friendly and handled my issue promptly and left me satisfied with the experience.",2017-07-06

I have yet to have a bad experience with this bank in my time with them. I moved from a regular bank to an online bank initially because it offered higher interest rates on savings accounts than traditional banks. I have found that beyond the interest rates, there are other conveniences to online banking. I can deposit checks without leaving my house using my mobile phone app. It is easy to go online any time and move money between accounts. I have created multiple savings accounts, each having different purposes, making it easier to manage my finances. There are also convenient ATM's that I can use (without being charged an ATM fee) if I need to withdraw money.<br/> <br/>I have had no issues with Capital One since opening the account. The only challenge that I have not yet been able to work around is depositing cash. The ATM's I have access to have not allowed me to deposit cash directly into that account. I still have an account with a traditional account for depositing cash that can then be transferred to my online account. This is my only frustration to this point.",2017-07-05

The latter also includes the ability to deposit checks via your phone which, as a small business owner, is something that I find incredibly useful especially at trade shows.<br/> <br/>The online interface retains many of the old ING features including a section for estatements and tax forms along with new features like tracking your credit score and your savings goals.

We shared a joint checking that we used for misc items that we share together. We both have our main bank accounts linked to our Capital one 360 account so we can transfer money in and out of the joint account to pay for things shared. The things I liked about 360 was the user friendly interface. We both had the app on our phones and can easily transfer money in and out. One of the downfalls I found was that transferring money to/from an outside bank, it took about 2-3 days. If you transfer intra-bank, the money is there instantly. I did not mind not having a physical bank as we never needed to withdraw physical money from the bank, we both used our debit cards to pay for shared purchases. One thing I did not like is that the app never saved your login information. In addition, CapitalOne 360 required you to have a special pin to login, along with username and password. I like apps that save this information as I can never remember it. We never had customer service issues.",2017-06-27

I was able to open up myself and my two children bank accounts with the bonuses. It was a great deal but it was making a deposit into the account at the time was inconvenient. I had great plans of using the accounts for savings for my kids but it became too much of a hassle. The accounts are still there and I really need start using them again. I am sure it is much easier making a deposit now and accessing our funds.,2017-06-15

The best part is that there are no fees! Not only that, but there's no minimum needed to get started and I'm earning interest. The customer service is great as well.

The charge was quickly removed from my account and I was sent a new card in the mail very quickly. The customer service was very responsive and seemed to put my needs above anything else.

The customer service at capital one has been the best I have ever experienced.

I also like the Creditwise function which lets me monitor my credit score, factors affecting my score, and my open accounts. I almost exclusively use the smartphone app which lets me view all my accounts, transfer funds, make P2P payments, make check deposits, and view Creditwise. On the website, you can set up savings plans with a saving account and view your progress to specific goals. I also love that their checking and saving accounts are fee-free.

Cap One 360 has a easy to use online interface and an app. I am not charged any fees for anything unless I use a an ATM out of their list of providers, even then Cap One does not charge me a fee, I only pay a fee the other provider charges. My checking and savings accounts both earn interest each month and I pay no fees for that. I have an overdraft line that charges me interest on any overdrafts that occur, but no other fees are charged for over drafting. I can seamlessly transfer money between various savings and checking accounts as well as my wife's accounts with Capital One 360. I have also set up a retirement IRA account and a capital one credit card that is linked to my Capital One 360 accounts and make for easy transactions and all my information (banking, retirement, credit) can be viewed on a single page. I use bill pay services and online checks frequently. They are incredibly easy and efficient. I do have a physical checkbook when needed. I have also had nothing but great customer service if I have run into any issues. My debit card was recently compromised. I was able to go online and immediately deactivate the card. I was able to quickly get through to customer service to report the situation, and once the fraudulent charge had cleared, i was able to go online and easily submit a claim.

I haven't had the account for very long, so I can only guess at the level of customer service, but based on my experience with them as my credit card carrier, I would imagine in to be about average.

You cannot beat that anywhere. The online BillPay is free, whether you are using the BillPay online or sending a check in the mail. You can transfer between other banks if need be. Example, I have another account with Capital One, and I am able to do transfers free with Capital One 360.

If my account is overdrawn, they charge interest on the past-due amount only, but there is an instant email notification so that funds can be transferred to avoid any interest fees at all. There is no minimum balance needed in order to earn 0.75% interest. Setting up multiple savings accounts for budgeting is as easy as several clicks. I have about 10 savings accounts with a nickname so I can put money into each fund as I save for a future expense. CapitalOne 360 is customer-oriented and has a quality of service that is matched by none.",2017-04-14
527,Great bank!,27455,20928,Capital One,38467,4,"When I moved to the city in which I currently live, I was in need of a bank but wanted to try an online one for a change. I decided on Capital 360 because I had heard from several friends that they were a good place to start. The application process was really simple and painless. I just needed a checking account, so I only had to fill out a single form. I heard back within minutes and was able to use it that day. I have only needed to contact them once to reset my password. The gentleman on the phone was really nice and rest my account within a few minutes. I would imagine I would open up a savings account with them in the future.",2017-04-12
528,Deposit convenience,27447,20928,Capital One,38459,4,"CapitalOne 360 is the online banking branch of Capital One -- formerly ING Direct. I have been a customer of theirs since the ING days. I like the convenience of online banking. I especially like being able to make mobile deposits. When Capital One took over ING I initially found their mobile deposit app clunky. I often had to take pictures of my checks multiple times in order to deposit them. Recent updates (and perhaps also due to the fact that I have a new phone with a better camera) have made the mobile deposit app much easier to use. Now I simply focus the phone's camera on my check, the program focuses in and snaps the picture, I turn the check over and repeat. To make the deposit, I enter the amount and slide my finger across the app. Instant deposit. It's fast and much more secure than sending a signed check through the mail -- the old way of making deposits before the advent of the mobile app. My only annoyance with this app is that even though I ask it to remember my password, it often doesn't -- or it does, but asks me to confirm my identity by entering a security code that they email to me. So I have to wait for the email (Or text --that's another option) enter the code and then proceed to my deposit. I'm usually in a hurry -- sometimes getting ready to walk out the door -- and waiting for this extra step is a big annoyance. I do wish they would fix this. Other than that annoyance, however, I'm very happy with CapitalOne 360. I can go online (or on my phone) and check my balances any time, and it's very easy to transfer money between my accounts or to non-CapitalOne accounts. I can have as many accounts as I want -- separate accounts for things like savings for a car or vacation. There's no extra charge for multiple accounts, and the accounts earn interest (admittedly a very tiny amount of interest, but still, it's something.)",2017-04-10
529,Capital One 360 - Effective for what it is.,27385,20928,Capital One,38332,3,"I'll start being blunt: I'm not in love with Capital One 360's product but it serves its need. My main bank will not allow me to transfer from the Venmo app, so I started Cap One 360 as a secondary account and I do like it. The website and app are easy to use and user-friendly, no real burdensome fees either. I got my bank card quickly and setting it up with customer service was easy. However, I would say that some of the transfer times to other banking institutions are a bit slow and the sign-up process is a bit burdensome, having to transfer money back and forth between their bank and your primary bank. I'd recommend it if you need it for specific reasons.",2017-04-04

I became a client two decades ago since at the time the interest rate on their savings was higher than any other bank I had seen. I worked at a bank at the time and a customer recommended the website to me. They are strictly online and I never had any issues with doing a name change, or transferring money. Any question I had were answered on a timely manner via their messaging platform. Opening up additional accounts was extremely easy. Closing one of my accounts was also just as easy. I only held savings accounts with them. I started with one, and then opened up two more. I had to close out one of my accounts when I reached my savings goal for that account. I liked how I was able to nickname my accounts so I knew exactly what the money was for. I loved that everything was done online, which is the best way for me to save.",2017-04-04

I finally decided to try online banking and because I've dealt with Capital One before,I decided to try them. I moved my personal checking account over to Capital Ones online banking and I could not be happier. The ease of my online banking is a big hit with me. I can do everything online as well or better than a traditional bank. They offer very competitive rates and the fees are reasonable and inline with traditional banks. They also,offer CDs,savings,iras and college accounts as well as several others. I've already looked into a personal savings account as well as college savings accounts for my grandchildren. I couldn't be happier with the customer service department and the very professional help I've received. I,highly recommend online banking for anyone thinking about it.",2017-04-03
532,Great no hassle checking,27294,20928,Capital One,38145,5,I open my account over a year ago and I love it. It's free to use there is no monthly fees. The APY on the checking account is 0.2% which is more than my local bank savings. The app is great you can transfer money easy between banks and also deposit checks. Deposit clear next business day to. There are also plenty of free ATM in my city. Overall I'm extremely happy with my account,2017-04-03
533,Online only checking,27275,20928,Capital One,38107,3,"I had banked with Capital One 360 checking because I liked the fact that you could take your checking account and divvy it up into different categories. We are following the Dave Ramsey plan, and and assigning a specific sub category for all of our money was especially helpful. The biggest drawback was that it took so long for money to transfer in order to pay bills. The customer service wasn't great either when I called to try to resolve the issues. In the end we just went back to a basic checking account and did subcategories on paper on our own. It was too difficult to get cash out since there were no ATMs or local branches. We had also tried another online banking called PerkStreet that had awesome returns, but they closed unexpectedly and when I called to withdraw my funds it took weeks to get them to send me a check overall, we prefer brick-and-mortar building so that we can go on and talk to actual bankers and set of having to call customer service all the time. We bank now with a rather large bank instead of smaller banks that are just starting out.",2017-04-01
534,Online banking that is dependable,27267,20928,Capital One,38099,4,"Overall, I would say that my experience thus far with capital one 360 online banking has been incredibly convenient. I have never had a issue with payments and all transactions go through in about a day's time. The site is simple to use and everything is laid out very simply. I primarily use the mobile app and everything I need is easily located on my dashboard. When making a payment, such as for my credit card, it is easy to simply click on my account on the dashboard and see the details of each transaction that has been made. I also have a savings account with the bank and it is easy to set up a scheduled deposit time. I have it set up as a weekly deposit and it really does reduce the worry of how much I need to deposit each week. With the fast transaction time, convenience of use and lack of any fees, it is a wonderful online banking experience.",2017-03-31

At first, I was very hesitant because it's solely an online bank and I wasn't sure if I felt compfortable with that. However, after using it consistently, I have been very pleased with their service, both online and on the phone. I have honestly had no issues with them at all! Being someone who has had to switch banking institutions many times, this is nothing but helpful! They've answered phone calls, helped me with any questions I've had. I use the institution for more than ten accounts these days.",2017-03-29
536,Smooth banking experience,27233,20928,Capital One,38034,4,"I first signed up for a Capital One checking and savings account years ago because they offered a $50 bonus. Since then, I have continued to use those accounts for online purchases and for savings. Their savings rates are much better than my brick-and-mortar bank. When I have had questions about my account, they have always been happy to answer them. I never have to wait for a long time on hold to talk to someone. They actually have cafes in my city, so I can get half-price drinks if I pay with my Capital One debit card. I can also talk to someone in person, but I rarely do. My accounts have been so easy to manage that I mostly just login. The only thing I don't like it is that it takes a long time to transfer money -- 5 to 7 business days. I'm not sure if that is because it's an online bank or that is the industry standard, though.",2017-03-29

We live a in rural area and do not get to town often. I do most of my bill paying online and I run a small business from my home. I needed a secure, convenient way to do my banking whenever I needed to. I opened my account and could not be happier. I can deposit checks through my smartphone. I can pay bill online. I can transfer monies through my paypal account and other payment accounts directly to my Capitol One account. If I need to deposit cash, there is a ATM nearby where I can do this. My only reservation is not being able to go into a branch office if needed. So far, that hasn't been a problem. Once I needed to talk with someone and I called their customer service and they were prompt and very helpful. They have overdraft options and in one of them they don't charge an overdraft fee, which is something I have never seen before. The account is completely free. This is the best option for someone like me.",2017-03-28

I don't actually remember being asked or gave permission for my money to stay with the new company but my account seemed to stay the same, five dollars set aside each week with a small amount of interest accrued. Ever since the change, I get credit card offers at least twice a month from Capital One. I had my password stored in my old computer and when I could not reset it online, I had to call customer service. They would not give me a password reset sent to my email, they told me they had to send it in the mail. I did not understand why since they use my email for notifications, that they had to send the new password via snail mail. Once I got the password though, account worked fine.",2017-03-27
539,I Love the Auto-transfer Feature,27132,20928,Capital One,37798,5,"I signed up for an online savings account to fund a yearly vacation. I initially signed up due to easy access and friendly online appearance. I set up a weekly auto transfer from my primary bank checking account. The auto save program has been better than the savings account connected to my bank, as I don't see the balance every time I check my balances. Since I see the account less often, I tend not to withdraw money as often. It really has been ""out of sight, out of mind"" money, and I have been pleased with the ease of deposits and access. When I gave needed money from the account, I simply transfer the funds directly to my primary bank checking account. I have never had an issue that required I call customer service, but I suspect they would be helpful and professional.",2017-03-23
540,Fantastic online-only bank,27118,20928,Capital One,37784,5,"I originally signed up with Capital One 360 back when it was owned by ING. They offer a savings rate that is exponentially higher than what you would receive from a traditional bank. Usually when I check savings rates, only Ally Bank's is higher. However, I stick with Capital One 360 because they have an excellent website interface. The also offer a mobile app that is very easy to use. It allows me to make transfers between bank accounts while I'm on the go and it only takes a few seconds. I receive email notifications for any activity made through my account, so I feel safer knowing that this would alert me to any fraudulent activity immediately. I also have several CDs with Capital One 360 and the process of opening them and maintaining them is so simple that it makes me want to create as many as possible. Overall I have had a great experience with Capital One 360 and would reccomend it to anyone.",2017-03-20
541,High Interest Savings Account,27068,20928,Capital One,37703,3,"I opened this account a few years ago when they were advertising a great savings interest rate. It was very easy to open the account and link an external bank for transfers. I also opened a checking account so I could immediately transfer funds from my 360 Savings to my 360 Checking and use the debit card ASAP in case I needed access to funds. They shipped my debit cars and checks in a very timely manner. The entire process was very straightforward and in the years that I've had the accounts I have no had any problems. <br/> <br/>The one issue I see is that I don't get much feedback from the company about new technology such as issuance of chip cards and security concerns. They have also lowered their advertised APR which has driven me to open an account with a local credit union with a higher interest rate. If Capital One 360 decides to once again offer competitive interest rates, I would not hesitate to put the majority of my savings and/or CD investments with the bank.",2017-03-15

I was worried when the bank was initially aquired by Capital One but service has greatly improved in that time. I called recently to get my name updated after getting married. I had tried to do this with the previous bank (ING) and it was a complicated process and I decided not to pursue it further. With one simple, easy 5 minute phone call I was able to get the name change completed. I love that I have no fees and receive interest even on my checking account. I appreciate being able to easily open multiple savings accounts. I wish it was possible to have more than one checking account with them though. The one drawback that I have found is that I also have to maintain an external banking account to be able to deposit larger checks or cash.

I switched my personal checking and personal savings accounts to capital one. I love its convenience and its customer service is outstanding.

544,No store front,26938,20928,Capital One,37383,5,"I have been banking with ING Direct (now Capital One Bank) since 2007. I am not very good at managing my money when I was younger, and never really learned how to keep track/balance a ledger so I would go overdraft a lot. I would incur these ridiculous fees for minor purchases that would put me below a zero balance. I would always joke with my friends that my $2 purchase at Taco Bell cost me $37. I was involved in a vicious cycle with the storefront banks, and somehow discovered ING no fee banking. They promoted saving, and if I went over by a couple of dollars here and there I was allowed to with a small line of credit attached to the account. I have never been happier, and I am not wasting money on fees. My only issue with them is there is no place to deposit cash. It hasn't been an issue in the last ten years, but I was working independently for a while and accepted a lot of cash payments. I looked and looked for a place I would be able to go to deposit my cash so I could pay my bills online, to no avail.

Capital One Bank is an online only, saving/checking debit account with no minimum upfront deposit fee, no annual charges and earns a small amount of interest every month. The card can be used pretty much anywhere Mastercard is accepted and is used internationally as well. Every transaction is easily recorded online and can be accessed through their site.

You see, I do not require a smile or a thank you, I merely require the service that is promised. Capital One meets that requirement. I have opened a second account, a savings that I auto-deposit to each paycheck to cover my periodic large payments on auto and house insurance, plus real estate taxes.

549,Formerly ING Direct,26763,20928,Capital One,36960,4,"I first got this bank account about ten years ago, under the business name ING Direct. It was a simple savings account that was difficult for me to withdraw from; it takes several days to transfer to another bank account, as it cannot be accessed or withdrawn directly. There are no fees for the account, which I enjoy, and setting up my direct deposit from work to submit a mere portion of my check was rather simple. Capitalone bought out ING several years ago, and after they did, I had trouble logging in, and had to call support. You can't simply email and request info, you must speak with a person. The guy I spoke with was nice, and solved my problem pretty easy, and also figured out why I wasn't able to log in - I was using the wrong username. The mobile app is pretty nice, simple, and easy to use. <br/> <br/>I only have a savings account with them, as I did not qualify for the checking account when the bank was ING.

The first impressive part about the company was how they managed the transition from one company to the other. It was seamless and very little was needed in terms of communication initiated by me because I knew what was happening and why and when. <br/> <br/>In terms of the products, Capital One institutes a couple of no brainer services that make so much sense for anyone who would open an internet only account. First, there is an access code you can generate if you want to use services like Mint or Personal capital. This way you don't have to share your account log ins. Also I feel like the fee structure (which is basically non-existent) is pretty straight forward. In this day in age, not many people believe in paying for a checking account to cover a bunch of features that they aren't going to use, so removing those fees and investing in the things like not charging an ATM fee ever is much more beneficial to the consumers.",2017-02-12

I typically find these in any 7-11, or the ATMs that Citibank deploys in places like Target. But the best part yet: I was posted to China for a year, and found that I could withdraw RMB from my USD Capital One Account, and there was no fee associated.

563,Okay if you direct deposit,26192,20928,Capital One,35496,4,"I signed up for this bank after being tired of the well known brick-and-mortar bank I have been using for the last couple of years. I wanted a bank that would not charge me so much in overdraft fees or service fees. As far as fees go this bank is one of the best. They do not charge a monthly service fee and their overdraft fees are one of the lowest. The customer service is excellent, I did not have to talk to an automated voice for very long and did not have any hold time. The one drawback is that if you deposit money into the account that is not direct deposit, there is a hold of five days. This hold time was too long for me and I didn't use the account for very long before closing it.",2017-01-05
564,Capital One360 is a great online bank,26133,20928,Capital One,35334,4,"I have used CapitalOne360 checking since it was ING. It is definitely a different kind of experience and geared towards the younger, millennial crowd. ING was a little different, funny in their approach and customer service, similar to how Southwest airlines is a little different. They maintained this style and brand even after being acquired by Capital One. You do not feel like you are dealing with a large faceless corporate bank. They are always quick to respond and very helpful. The fee structure is extremely reasonable and they offer cash back rewards for large dollar deposits. I'm able to now link my CapitalOne360 with my investment accounts (also formerly ING) and Capital One Credit cards making it very easy to use and transfer between accounts. They offer bill pay and mobile deposit. They offer check-writing and a debit card. While not having access to a physical branch can pose a problem sometimes, and the deposit hold times seem a little long, I would highly recommend CapitalOne360 if you're looking for an online checking account.",2017-01-04
565,I Am Very Unhappy About Account Registration.,26152,20928,Capital One,507,2,"I have two accounts. a checking account about 5 years old and a CD about one year old. The checking is registered in my trust. The bank will not register my CD in a trust. After complaining for about one year about the CD a manager told me not only I can't register my CD in my trust but there is no way to add a beneficiary or PAY on DEATH because the bank has no way of doing it and the employees have no idea if and when the bank will be able to register the account in any of the three choices(trust, beneficiary, or POD beneficiary).",2016-12-30
566,Not Happy,26093,20928,Capital One,35258,3,"Overall, I am not happy about my Capital One 360 bank anymore. When the bank was ING Direct I used to have a big interest rate. That was the only reason I moved my savings there. Now, since the rates are low, there are almost no benefits of keeping my money there. In fact, it's more of an inconvenience to move money in and out of this bank. It takes days to transfer to my local branch, and even when I have to take cash out, I have to move it to another internal Capital one account to get my money. Some transactions don't even complete, so I end up paying penalties.",2016-12-30
567,Mobile Check Deposit,26108,20928,Capital One,35290,2,Never use this to deposit checks. It takes a week. They process it but hold your money. That is wrong. If you need to make a deposit cash it then make a deposit. Still waiting.,2016-12-28
568,Capital 360 blunder,26050,20928,Capital One,35161,3,"I opened a Capital One 360 savings account. This was my first experience with internet/online banking. I've always used a brick and mortar bank, but Capital One offers much better interest rates than any of my local banks do so I thought it would be a good move. I tried to transfer $1000 from my local bank to this savings account. Capital One said they had to verify my account before I could transfer money. They would make two small deposits and I was supposed to report how much those deposits were. This would take 2-7 days. They deposited the money, I reported how much the deposits were, but the $1000 wasn't transferred right away. So I got the brilliant idea that maybe they needed a check to transfer the money from my local bank to Capital One. So I wrote myself a $1000 check. As most of you probably can guess, this resulted in $2000 being shown as a deposit. Except I only had $1000 in my bank account. So I called Capital One, and they said not to worry. I called my local bank and they said the check would be rejected, and there would be a charge for that, but otherwise it would be okay. So it worked out with only a $25 stupid tax, but I've learned how to deposit money and now I'm a 360 fan.",2016-12-28

570,Just what I needed.,25998,20928,Capital One,35011,4,"My experience with Capital One 360 has been exactly what I've been looking for. It's difficult to nearly impossible to live nowadays without some form of digital payment. Whether you're buying something on Amazon, or need to pay your bills in a pinch, having a checking account is a must. Unfortunately, many banks charge fees. Sure, they can be waived when you meet certain requirements, but not everyone has that option. For someone without direct deposit, nor the luxury of having a minimum amount of money set aside to keep in the account, online banking is a great option. Capital One 360 was my first choice, and likely the only one I'll ever need. I can check my balance whenever I need to, the checks I deposit with my mobile phone go through relatively quickly, and best of all, no fees!",2016-12-24
571,Just what I needed,25986,20928,Capital One,34997,4,"I never knew what 360 was when it came to Capital One. When I learned what it was, it ended up being just what I needed. I don't have any branches of my normal bank close to me now so this was a life saver. Before I moved in, I knew I would have to find a bank there that had a branch close to where I was moving. That ended up being hard and, luckily, I found 360. They make it very easy to deposit checks and money orders when it comes to their app. They even have a limit on the amount you can deposit each month that is way more than I will ever use, but is is nice to know that limits and other things on the app and site are easy to read and understand. Even though I do miss going to a branch sometimes, this company just makes it more stress free and easier to handle my banking needs in one spot.",2016-12-22
572,Great online experience,25883,20928,Capital One,34754,4,I was able to open multiple savings accounts for free with this online banking system. My children were able to start saving using an online account. We were given bonuses for opening each account for my family members. The bank did not ever charge any fees nor have an hidden costs. I have been very pleased with the bank. It is very easy to access 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Transactions have been smooth and I have no complaints. I receive paperless options which is great for the environment. Each year it is very easy to access my bank account in order to prepare my taxes. Statements are very clearly provided and easy to access as well. No minimum balance has ever been required as well. The bank is FDIC insured which guarantees I don't lose my money. The bank has been a great online option for me and my family.,2016-12-16

At that time, the bank was known as ING Direct. My experience with this bank has mainly been on the positive side. I have had no major issues with them and the customer care associates are very friendly when speaking to them. The only issue I have is there are not enough ATMs available in my area that allow customers to make a deposit. I always use a money order to make deposits by mailing them directly to the banking center. It is very inconvenient having to do this. Overall, a great experience.",2016-12-16
574,360 Accounts Offer Excellent No Fee Services!,25779,20928,Capital One,34559,4,"Capital One 360 is an online-only bank that does not have any physical branches. Since the bank only functions online, it saves money on overhead and passes those savings on to you. I proudly have a savings account and a checking account with them and am very pleased with the service. I pay absolutely no fees and the interest rate for the savings account is rather good. I use this account as my primary account to transfer money to and from various sources like PayPal and my gym membership and am very pleased with the speed of the transfers. In addition, I have used their debit card all over the country from Arizona to Hawaii and have never encountered any problems. <br/> <br/>The one issue that I have with this bank is that it cuts back too much with its customer service and forces you to call them up and wait for a considerable amount of time to get your questions clarified. It would also be nice if they partnered up with other institutions like credit unions or convenience stores so that I could make cash deposits. <br/> <br/>Other than the slight lack of customer service, it is a fee free bank that lets you relax knowing that your money is safe.",2016-12-06

It is incredibly easy to use, and signing up took less than a half hour. It was very simple to set up automatic monthly deposits from an existing checking account. The interest rate is amazing for a savings account, and I love that there are no fees. The website is very user friendly, and makes setting up transfers (both within and outside of the bank) or deposits a breeze. Mobile check deposits are also very simple, and again, don't have a fee attached (different than my traditional brick and mortar bank).<br/> <br/>I have only had to speak with customer service once, and when I did they were friendly and helpful.

If you go to an approved ATM there's also no fees there. I live in a fairly rural area and there's one in town that's very accessible inside Target.

The easiest thing for us was opening the account and then every payday, deposit funds directly into the savings account. The best part of the account for us was the ability to transfer the money into our personal checking right from our living room. This was great because it takes a few days to hit your account without making an impulse buy if you want access the money right away.<br/>We also had a very nice experience with their customer service department when there was a possible unauthorized attempt to login from a foreign computer. CapitalOne360 noticed that something was suspicious of the attempted login and immediately notified us as the threat. The best part was that our money was safe and sound right where it should be.<br/>CapitalOne360 is an amazing bank- 10/10 would recommend",2016-11-15

I have thought about changing to a different bank recently because the interest rate, while still at an acceptable rate of .75%, is not as high as it once was. I know banks often entice you with a high introductory rate but in this case, I'm not sure the current rather pedestrian interest rate is worth the inconvenience of having no physical bank locations and a 5-day freeze on money transferred to other accounts. However, the user interface is quite nice, and it's easy enough to transfer money to other accounts, find my statements, and locate tax documents. They have also recently added the ability to check and track your credit score over time for free, which is a feature that the bank I use for checking does not offer.",2016-11-07

Transfers to and from this bank to my brick and mortar bank have gone through without a problem, and I haven't had any problems using the debit card.<br/> <br/>The only issues I have had, is that when I forgot my password, it was a little bit hard to reset, as the site was being glitchy, and when I lost my card, it took quite a while to be mailed to me.

Money is typically transferred within one day. Their website is easy to navigate. Their interest rates, while not the highest among online banks, are decent and better than traditional brick and mortar banking institutions. Their accounts typically have no minimum balances and no fees. They provide e-statements and the ability to deposit checks using their mobile app, making them a truly paperless banking platform. Although I did not use it, they do offer online bill pay. Checking account provide overdraft protection and accounts are insured by the government.

Typically by 6:30am on the day I get paid, my funds are available. I have yet to use the mobile check deposit feature as I do not deal with paper checks very often.<br/> <br/>The mobile app is very good. It works quickly and fluidly. It allows me to see my checking, savings, and credit card account overviews right on the first screen of the app, then a breakdown of transactions by selecting the account that I want.

The fees are very reasonable and I received a $350 bonus just for opening the account and setting up my direct deposit from work to it. A couple of times I have had to call customer service for various charges or questions and they have been incredibly helpful and were able to resolve my problems very quickly.

585,Generally positive experiences with Capital One 360,25179,20928,Capital One,33273,4,"Generally I have had positive experiences with Capital One 360 online only banking. This bank satisfies my banking needs for paying bills and other expenses. Whenever I have needed to contact customer service, I have never had to wait long on the line. I had been a member with Capital One 360 since they acquired ING Direct, of which I was previously a member, and I have not noticed any major changing in banking since the change. I am able to deposit money into my accounts in several convenient ways including direct deposit of a paycheck, transfer of funds from one of my other bank accounts, submission of image of received check, and transfer through PayPal. When I first started banking with ING-Direct, they offered really good interest rates in savings accounts, much better than any non-online bank, however, current interest rates with Capital One 360 are so low that they're not even worth mentioning. Capital One 360 did not introduce the low interest rates, however. This change happened under ING-Direct. It is really disgraceful that banks could charge such high interest rates to consumers on credit cards, but not offer higher interest rates for consumers who save, in return. So I use other investment vehicles that offer much better interest rates. One feature of Capital One 360 that I really like is the overdraft protection. While the amount is somewhat low (25.00$), the bank does not charge you a big fee, like other banks do, if you go over your limit. Instead they charge you reasonable interest rates until your balance is returned to positive. This feature is a big plus.",2016-10-11

All I know is that both my accounts are frozen and I cannot speak to anyone to find out the problem and how to resolve it. It is a good bank as long as you do not have any issues. Once you have an issue, pray you do not need your money any time soon. I will try one more time by visiting a cafe. If that does not work, I am going to the regulators.",2016-10-04

Making the switch was easy, and mostly could be done online. I only had to call Capital One to close my other savings account once my money was transferred over.<br/> <br/>A few months after this, I moved, and the new city in which I live does not have any Capital One ATM locations near my home or office, so I was looking for a new bank for my checking account. Since I'd had such a great experience with savings, I looked into Capital One 360. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they offered a better interest rate than my existing checking account, and offered ATM access at all AllPoints ATMS (more than 40,000 locations nationwide, and several close to my home). Once again, making the switch was simple and I'm very happy with my new checking account!<br/> <br/>The only downside is that Capital One 360 does not have it's own mobile app, and it's a little confusing to access your 360 accounts from the Capital One mobile app. But the online banking interface is easy to use otherwise.",2016-09-29

I have the one checking account with them (which is the maximum per SSN), and about 15 different savings accounts. The max on savings accounts is 25, and are all visible from the main page.

I still used my traditional bank checking account; however, this past year I grew very unsatisfied with my bank and moved all of my assets to Cap One 360. Since then, I have been extremely happy. I have been living as a visitor in Canada and my old bank was charging me international use fees - not the case with Cap One 360. Also, their no-overdraft charge policy has been fantastic and very useful for me (I cut it close sometimes in my travels). <br/> <br/>On the few occasions that I've had to call customer service I have always dealt with pleasant, easy to understand and very helpful representatives. Talking to them has actually been pain-free and pleasant as opposed to a real pain in the butt like other banks have been.

Their network of ATM affiliates was extensive and really made me feel like I might as well have had a local bank. I really don't go into a bank branch location anyway, so not having a person I could physically talk with didn't affect me much.

Occasional downtime on their service, combined with a rather poor web design, and banking terms that I just didn't have time to really wrap my head around, made for an overall pretty poor experience. That being said, whenever I had to contact them about issues, I generally got a polite enough agent who was willing to assist with my problems, so there's that.

I originally signed up with ING Direct at least 8 years ago. It was changed into Capital One 360 since then. I have always experienced a high levels of service and a great variety of products from them. The best thing about this online bank account is the very high savings rate. Currently it is 0.75%, which is magnitudes better than the return you would get from any brick and mortar bank. Its ridiculous how much interest I am able to accrue each month. I sometimes have to double check my statement to see that the interest payment is actually correct because it seems so foreign to see such a high return from a basic savings account. The only downside to this account is that it takes a few days to do a transfer to a brick and mortar bank. However, just keep in mind that online savings account should not be treated as an immediately liquid account. It is more of a semi-liquid account due to the transfer delay.

599,CapitalOne360 is great for mobile users,24486,20928,Capital One,31758,5,"I have been a customer of CapitalOne360 since the beginning. They have no minimum balance requirements, extremely low fees, and offer over 40,000 free ATMs in their network. In fact, if you are charged an ATM fee by a host bank, CapitalOne360 will reimburse the fee. They also offer check deposit via the internet or via their mobile app... just snap a picture of the check and upload it. It's very simple and easy to use. No trip to the bank necessary. I have also found their customer service to be very responsive and always available by phone or chat with almost no wait time. I have used them since they were ING Direct, which was later acquired by CapitalOne. The service has only improved. Another nice feature is that you can additional checking and savings accounts at will right online and give them unique names and purposes, such as Vacation or Christmas account. Transferring funds between accounts is quick and effortless.",2016-07-26

The main perk, for me, is that I can manage all of my finances in one app. I have my credit cards and my auto loans with Capital One, as well as my checking account, so it makes it easy. Sometimes it's difficult because there are no physical locations, but I've found that mostly everything I need to do is within the app. Plus, I hardly ever have to go on the website because everything I need is on the app. I've had to call customer service a few times, but I'm never on hold for very long and the reps are super friendly. I also LOVE that there are no fees for having an account, because that was my major issue with my last bank.

I currently have a checking and savings account with them since around 2010 and have been very pleased. Interest rates are the highest on both checking and savings accounts. Opening up an account is a breeze, and the online portal is efficient and easy to navigate. Frequently they provide bonuses for customers opening up new accounts. In addition, you can refer a friend for an additional $25 per friend that joins. Fees are minimal and appropriate. For example, overdrafts are billed on a percentage of the overdraft amount, not a flat rate of $35 plus the overdraft amount like other banks. I have contacted customer support a few times and was helped immediately, resolving my issues quickly.

They have other products, but I have only looked and haven't opened any accounts other than my checking/savings. One thing I must say that I LOVE about Capital One 360 is that there are no fees on their checking account. There are thousands of ATM's you can use.

Through out all the changes and up till now it's probably been at least 10 years. When it first became Capital One 360 I was a little bit worried. I didn't believe at the time that the Capital One credit cards had the best reputation. But...the bank has exceeded my expectations. I still have a very active checking and savings account, but I primarily only use the checking account. The interest I get on money in the checking account kind of makes the savings account a moot point. Aside from the dependability of the bank the bill paying section is one of the best. It's quick, easy, and after many years...completely dependable. never had a problem with it. It is easy to sign up. It's been so long since I signed up I can't remember for sure but I don't think there is a minimum to get started. I recommend Capital One 360 to all my family and friends.

However, my fears were for nothing. Capital One 360 has continued to be my online bank of choice. Its super easy to sign up, they don't ask you a million questions. The web interface is one of the easiest I've used. Other banks have too may options and it takes forever for me to find just simple things like sending them an email. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to email Wells Fargo. With Capital One 360 they keep it easy, I was able to find and send them an email in 30 seconds. They also are very quick to reply.

I checked the brick and mortar business I use for my personal accounts and I was disappointed at the amount of fees I would have to pay for a relatively small average balance. Since I already have a savings account with Capital One 360, I decided to call to see what my options were. I was delighted when I heard there would be no fees and no minimum balances that I would have to maintain. The gentleman I talked with was patient and very nice and answered all my questions. Because of the great experience I had with customer service, I opened up an account for my small business.<br/> <br/>A few times over the past few years, I've had to call customer service; once because I couldn't get into my account and another time because I wanted to make some changes to my existing accounts.

I called customer service many times, and it never fails I stay on the phone for at least 20-30 minutes for just a simple question. I do like that I am not charged any fees and that the customer service is very polite when I do reach them. I like that this site monitors my credit as well with a credit tracker.

We still have no fees, great ATM access, and helpful customer service. We were eligible for free checks, didn't use them, and when we switched our address, it said we were no longer eligible for those free checks anymore. I called up customer service, and they addressed the issue right then & there and mailed us our free checks.

I have used the bill pay system and had no errors. I use the ATM at my local Target store and it has been free. I am careful to avoid fees and would not stay with a bank that had them. It was easy to work with a banker by telephone when I had to get help with my PIN. I have never had a problem with this Cap360 and I really appreciate that.,2016-05-27

I loved ING so much, I think I even told a customer service rep once that I would have the bank's babies. A couple of years ago Capital One bought out ING. I was worried things were going to change, but so far not much has. The interest rates keep dropping, but that was happening (along with the rest of the banking world) when ING was still in control. It's still very much an online-only bank. You can't go to Capital One bank branches, but you can use their ATMs. I like being able to have bunches of external accounts linked to my Capital One 360 accounts as it makes doing my household banking a bit easier until I get around to consolidating everything.",2016-05-16

It is super simple to setup and allows me to make sure I have enough money for a down payment on a car, or enough for a vacation to Mexico! The web interface is very intuitive and the saving rates are reasonable. I would always like to earn more interest but I'm not paying any fees so I guess I can't complain. I also used the debit card for overseas ATM usage since there were no foreign transaction fees. This was very helpful and allowed me to enjoy my trip to the fullest!

I have made several investments into money market accounts over time with capital 360, especially in the last two years.

Having an account separate from my local bank is great because I can put my emergency fund money there. It only takes a couple days to transfer between banks, so my money is always available if I need it, and that few day transfer time can be a deterrent to keep me from buying something I don't actually need. The interest rate at Capital One 360 is not the best of all of the internet banks at 0.75% at the time I opened the account, but it is better than any local offering.

618,Bad Tax Mistake On Mortgage,23687,20928,Capital One,29613,1,"Bought a new house in Sept 2015, (it was built for me from scratch), got their 15 year ARM. In Jan, got a notice that my escrow account was too low, and that they paid over 7K in county taxes. Taxes should be around $2500. Tax authority sent the money back. After days and hours on the phone, they told me that they outsourced the escrow to CoreLogic, who determined that the tax liability was over 7K. The land was part of a bigger piece before the builder bought it, sliced it up and started building houses, hence the discrepancy. But it took months for them to fix it. They gave me a false 2015 1098, messing up my taxes. I told them to issue me a new one, and they said no, the 2016 will show a refund of 7K (making whatever I pay in 2016 not deductible..) so it effectively screwed up my income taxes for 2 years. I asked for a copy of the recordings of our phone conversations, they said no: those are 'privileged.' Customer service is legalistic and hapless from the bottom up, wasted hours of my time, and just kept blaming CoreLogic, but would not provide me with any means to contact CoreLogic. I also asked to be exempt from escrow, as I only owe about $110K on a 300K house (the original loan was for about 150K. They said no, because I haven’t had the account for a full year, never mind the 800 credit score, less than 50% LTV, and 100K income… I went with these guys b/c they were cheap, and it has cost me more time and stress than it saved me in $.",2016-04-18

I didn't have to gather up information that I already knew off the top of my head. It was easy to sign up on their website and in moments I had a checking and savings account. About a week later I had my debit card, some days after that I got checks. Yes they still exist, and you get the first book for free. I'm able to make deposits online through Paypal or Amazon Payments. I can even deposit check through their app, and it actually works.

I do dislike how hard it is to put money into the account, with no branches or ATMs with cash deposit capabilities in my network within 75 miles of my home, it makes this account a little trickier. If you have direct deposit, then you have no problems, but if you deal with a lot of cash and will need to deposit it into your account, I would double check available locations in your area.",2016-04-06

One of my best friends had recommended them to me as he had been a user for a few years prior. I started banking with them 3 years ago and started with an automatic 360 savings account. It was so easy to set up and took less than 48 hours for me to get started. I have been working on my budget and getting debt free and thought how nice it would be to have a vacation fund so I didn't have to charge my trip. I started 8 months ago, an automatic savings plan each week, to start saving up for my family's trip to Disney this fall. I now have 4 different savings accounts and a 360 Checking account but they are all easily accessible from my same account and login. After I opened my savings account there was a holiday special that when you signed up for a 360 checking account you get a $75 bonus so I took advantage of the offer and like promised we received the bonus. To this day we still use the checking account for our gas money and when we go on vacations we just use this card instead of our local debit card. It is so convenient in case we need to transfer money from another account it is there immediately!!! It is so easy to transfer between accounts and at any time I need to adjust the amount going in or to transfer between accounts it is so quick and takes just a couple steps. I plan to continue to use capital one 360 from now on. I highly recommend this bank to anyone!!!",2016-03-28
623,Capital One 360 Savings,23525,20928,Capital One,29157,4,"I originally set up a savings account with an online bank called ING Direct, which was subsequently bought out by Capital One 360. Comparatively, the customer service with Capital One has been far better, particularly because I'm one of those people who tends to lose their pin number or login information. That said, some of the things I really like about this kind of savings account may not be appealing to all consumers. I set up this savings account to limit my access, in the sense that it takes several days for money to transfer out of the account and into my checking account. As someone who has struggled with financial responsibility in the past, the inaccessibility of my money means that I really get to decide if something is an ""emergency"" or not. Admittedly, this can be kind of annoying if you are trying to meet a quick expense, but good if you have a tendency to dip into savings for things that you could figure out other ways to pay for. I also like the interest rate--0.75%--and I like that you can set up automatic withdrawals every month from your checking account. For example, if you want to start saving $50/month, you can set that up with Capital One 360. You can also cancel that feature any time. Finally, I like the fact that I can quickly set up accounts for different things (""Germany 2017 Fund"") and then close them when that need has passed.",2016-03-28

I originally opened the account purely for a sign up bonus, which they offer year round. However, I have since used the account much more than I originally intended! Capital One 360 allows you to create as many savings accounts tied to your main account as you want; I use this functionality to create separate savings buckets with different goals. It really helps me save when I can see how much money I have saved for each project.<br/> <br/>By far the best part about this bank is the fast and free ACH transfers. I have another account at a local bank, but they try to charge me fees to initiate an ACH transfer, along with the hassle of going down to the branch.

626,Capitalone 360 Has Lost Its Way,23394,20928,Capital One,28824,3,"CapitalOne 360 bank, which used to be known as ING Direct, is a great internet bank if you are looking for savings and checking accounts. However, ever since Capital One acquired ING Direct, the rates have fallen significantly, such that many other internet banks (like AmericanExpress Bank or Discover Bank) offer much higher interest yields on the savings, CD, and checking accounts. While I am not sure as to the reason, I believe the cause of this is because Capital One has a high operating cost that prevents them from offering the higher rates to consumers, whereas ING Direct used to have very low physical presences.<br/> <br/>The benefit of CapitalOne 360 is that they do offer online checking accounts, which many other online banks do not. Thus, there is no need to order checks for paying bills, since CapitalOne 360 will allow you to write and send e-checks to your landlord or anyone you seek to pay. CapitalOne 360 will take your request and mail a check on your behalf, which is much easier than paying for your checks every year. Also, you can access your cash through an ATM network, but it is limited to the STAR network. If you use any ATM not in that network, you will be charged handsomely (and these ATMs are not easy to find since they are not prominently labeled).",2016-03-10

I will say that customer service was great when I had my paypal account hacked. They were easily able to prevent paypal transactions simply by blocking the vendor and then quickly set up a new account for me, transferred my money. <br/>I like that you can easily set-up multiple savings accounts (for different saving goals etc). Some banks make you jump through hoops to open accounts, but it's very easy with Capital One. It was also very easy to set-up savings accounts for my kids so I have a safe place with a decent interest rate to keep their money.",2016-02-23

I fell in love with the idea of the online bank because it just made sense to me. Because it's an online bank, the bank itself has less overhead which means the cost savings get trickled down to me in the form of better savings interest rates and lower fees. I love my savings account because it has absolutely no fees. I can link all of my outside banking accounts to it for easy transferring of money between my accounts. Every time I've had to call the bank (for example to change my name on the account after getting married), their customer service has been excellent.

I don't have a car, so it can be a huge hassle for me to go in to a bank branch every time I need to deposit a check or transact some sort of business on my bank account. I love that Capital One lets you do every aspect of banking from your own home. You can deposit checks simply by taking pictures of the front and back of your check and uploading them to the website. It's simple, quick, and painless. And I loved that I didn't actually have to go into a branch to open the accounts, and that I don't have to worry about being required to go to a branch to make changes to my accounts. It can be such a hassle when a bank requires you to handle these things in person when it can so easily be done online.

To be honest, I don't use the checking account very much because my spending is almost all on credit cards, but the savings account has been very helpful. They don't pay the best interest in the market, but they always pay a fair rate that is higher than Bank of America, Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, etc. Even more importantly, the website is well-designed and always works, and they don't change it all the time or take it down for maintenance. The ACH transfers work quickly and I never have to call for customer support because everything is online and easy to use. I also appreciate that they don't play games like giving you a nice rate when you sign up and then lowering it. Finally, I have never been charged a fee and I don't have to churn money through to avoid fees or maintain the interest rate. You can find internet banks with higher rates or promises of additional services, but Capital One delivers effective basic banking and doesn't take advantage of customers.

633,Capital One takes over ING direct,22994,20928,Capital One,27537,4,"As a very happy customer of ING Direct, I was really dismayed when it was announced that Capital One was taking over. The familiar ORANGE website left first, the passwords were changed and that homey, grassroots feeling was gone. I expected to lose many functions and expected tighter policies - but they didn't come. The interest rate remains competitive, the communication remains clear and the transfers are accurate and timely. Capital One 360 encourages you to save and your former share builder account, the stock purchase program for small investors, can be linked with your Cap One savings and/or checking account. This convenience gives you a snapshot of your financial kingdom on one website and you can make it a part of your morning routine. To accomplish your life dream, reviewing your goals and current financial condition every day is one of the best suggestions given by the success guru, Napoleon Hill. While that warm fuzzy feeling on the website seems gone, the attributes of a better way to bank still remains.",2016-01-12
634,Needed an online bank! Great find for me!,22991,20928,Capital One,27534,4,"I recently moved away from my credit union's area of operations, so I needed an online bank I could trust. After speaking with a few people, I was under the impression that CapitalOne360 would be a great start. They were not wrong! I was able to easily open an account linked to my existing bank account with the credit union. Not only was I able to create an account quickly, I was able to borrow from it if the needed arose. When I did borrow from it, a few times, the interest rate was really competitive and I felt like I was not getting taken advantage of. I have had to call their customer support line a few times to reset my passwords and all of the times the agents were really nice and friendly.",2016-01-11

Once I overdrew my savings account and wasn't aware of the mistake for a couple of weeks. I contacted the customer service and they were able to remove some of the related fees. The people there are very helpful and the banking works just as well as a traditional provider. I would strongly recommend this service.",2016-01-06
636,"A great, easy to use, bank",22877,20928,Capital One,27186,5,"I opened a checking account with the Capital One 360 online banking company, and so far it has been very simple and easy to use. So far I haven't once experienced an out of place fee or erroneous charge. Every time I check my account online, the service is up and running, and I can access my account very quickly. It also helps that there are a lot of ATM's nationwide that work with my service, without instituting annoying and hefty convenience fees. Another really cool feature I found was that I could take a picture of checks I want to deposit and upload them using a feature called ""checkmate"", which is a downloadable app. The only time I have had to use their customer service was when I forgot my password, but the associate that handled my request was friendly and got me my password within minutes. I would definitely recommend this site to others, especially first timers.",2015-12-23
637,Review of Capital One 360,22839,20928,Capital One,27057,4,"I have been banking with Capital One 360 internet banking for quite a while now. I've shopped around with the other banks from time to time and have yet to feel compelled enough to move my funds to another bank. Their service has been above average and I haven't had any major issues with them. The interest rates that they offer are usually competitive. They aren't always the highest rates being offered, but rates fluctuate so much that I'm not sure any bank is ever offering the highest at all times. Also, the customer service is great. Any time I've had a reason to contact them they have resolved my problem in a timely fashion and in such a way that it didn't seem like a problem for them. They were always friendly and polite on the phone with me. You know it's good customer service when they act like you're doing them the favor by calling! I would recommend looking into Capital One 360 if shopping around for banks.",2015-12-20
638,"Wonderful online bank, great for travel",22833,20928,Capital One,27051,4,"I was actually pretty surprised about my experience with Capital One 360, since online banks don't necessarily sound like they would be the most convenient. However, it's pretty great. I can deposit checks online, and if I ever have cash to deposit, I can do so at al all-point ATM sans-fee. Not only that, but they charge very very low foreign transaction fees. Overall, this is an ideal account for travel. The transaction fees, coupled with low to no ATM fees, makes this account affordable. I especially appreciate that although Capital One 360 isn't a big bank like Chase or Wells Fargo, they are fairly prompt and speedy about making funds available and the speed at which money gets transferred between external accounts. Overall, I've had a really solid experience with this bank.",2015-12-16

Signing up is very easy and quick. There are no fee or minimums on their checking or savings accounts. I was skeptical at first because a lot of banks say this then have fees hidden away. That's not the case with Capital One 360. They are very helpful and are upfront with you about everything that they offer. I really wish I would have listened to my friends earlier and opened an account with them sooner. You never know what you are missing out on until you give it a try. Who know, you may just be as surprised as I was. If you are looking for a bank that is easy, quick, and hassle free, this is the bank for you.",2015-12-10
640,A Solid Internet Bank,22753,20928,Capital One,26846,4,"I opened a checking account because of a promotion that offered a bonus for opening the account. Unfortunately, I had some problems online so I had to call in and was met by a very enthusiastic and helpful man who sorted through my problems and allowed me to open the account without trying to up-sell me on other services I wouldn't be interested in. The only downside to this is that I was sent a survey request regarding this contact and it was far more time consuming than I'd have liked.<br/> <br/>The bank's online interface was very easy to use. I could easily see my balance and set up transfers as needed. The checking account pays a very minimal interest rate that varies based on the amount of money you have in the account, but it's still better than what most banks provide. And I was happy to see that I received my bonus as expected, when expected without having to call or message the bank. Very happy with the service thus far. And the checking is free!<br/> <br/>I don't usually use the debit card provided with the account but I used it once at the store without any problems whatsoever.

I was unable to get my money out of the account and I called them several times, they always tell me that I need to stop the check ( Do you believe that! Don't they know that cleared check cannot be stopped! Did they ever worked in a bank! ). It seems that they don't know what they are doing. I even filed a claim to Better Business Bureau but they ignored it. I think my only option is to go to court and file a small claim to get my money back.

642,On point 360 degrees in every direction,22693,20928,Capital One,26682,4,"I first joined Capital One 360 with a checking account because they had just bought out ING Direct. I was one of the accounts they acquired through the transaction and I had been very happy with ING, so I was very worried about this new bank that had taken over. I was completely convinced they would eventually start charging me fees for my checking account and I even tried to open a new checking account with another bank (wish I hadn't bothered now).<br/> <br/>It turns out CapOne started out like ING, then, as the years passed, continued to be like ING! I'm still very pleased with this bank that has exceeded my expectations and not once charged me for my checking account. I did have to purchase checks, but only for $5 and I still have the checkbook because I rarely write checks anymore. I get a very low interest rate with the account and that's okay because the balance is usually low. I don't expect to make money from a checking account, anyway, and there isn't a lot of better rates out there.<br/> <br/>I'm just happy the checking is free and there are some locations in my area where I can withdraw cash if I need to at no expense. This bank has some of the nicest people--American people--to call if you need any assistance. (Surely, I'm not the only one annoyed at foreign operators with such heavy accents that you can't understand them and are taking our jobs away in the U.S.A.!) I've only had to call once due to needing to obtain my PIN number for my debit card and my customer service rep. couldn't have been nicer. This is a fabulous bank!",2015-11-24

My biggest gripe about them is it was right at impossible to get someone the line to get my password reset, because their online tool for resetting the password wasn't working. After that everything was pretty good until they introduced the mobile deposit on their mobile app. I needed to deposit a check and it was supposed to be available the next day, so that wasn't a big issue. But immediately after depositing it, they put a 10 day hold on it, that was a great inconvenience because I needed the money the next day. Of course I know they do it for security reasons, but I had a pressing financial financial need and of course the check cleared. I wish they would be more direct about their mobile deposit process. Other than that it's been an ""ok"" experience.",2015-11-19
644,Best Savings Bank,22657,20928,Capital One,26592,4,"A while ago, I wanted to find an online institution that would help me save. Saving was a huge problem of mine that I just couldn't do. I came across Capital One 360 and decided I would give it a try. The first thing that made me realize they were a good institution is I didn't need a bunch of money just to open up an account with them. That was a huge plus. I highly enjoyed that there was an option for them to automatically take out any amount I set up from my bank account. If I couldn't make the savings deposit, no problem! I was able to go in to their website and change the date or just have them skip a withdrawal! Their website is so easy to navigate. I absolutely loved dealing with them. I never needed to get a hold of customer service because any question I had I could easily find the answer to on their website. <br/> <br/>The only down fall was if I needed to transfer the money back to bank account, I had to wait 3 business days for the funds to be transferred. But hey, that's why it's a savings account. They don't want to make it too easy for you to be able to pull money out of it! <br/> <br/>All in all, my experience was a good one with Capital One 360.",2015-11-18
645,Capital One 360 is WONDERFUL,22589,20928,Capital One,26369,4,"I have been a customer of Capital One 360 bank for several years (since it was ING). Their customer service is absolutely outstanding. I had a situation just yesterday where I needed to get in touch with them, but it was a Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised that their hours are 7 days a week from 8am-8pm. They answered on the first ring!! My issue was that I needed to get my direct deposit and some other draft items switched over from another bank's checking account. They were able to answer all of my questions and made me feel very happy that they are my bank. I use Capital One 360 for both checking and savings. Their savings account rate is VERY competitive, with no minimum balance. I believe there is no need to lock your money away in a CD when you can earn a rate that is almost that high and have access to your money at any time. I would definitely recommend this bank.",2015-11-03
646,I love Capital One 360,22551,20928,Capital One,26228,5,"I love Capital One 360 online bank as much as anyone can love a financial institution. I have been a customer of theirs for well over 10 years, beginning when they were ING Direct. I started with one savings account and that has grown into multiple accounts for specific savings goals that I currently have. To start with, their interest rate on regular savings is 5 times higher than the rate my local credit union pays. Deposits and withdrawals are simple online transactions that work directly with your local brick and mortar banks. I have mine set up to transfer money between 4 Capital One accounts and two checking accounts at different intuitions. This makes moving money for my rental house easy and allows me to earn a higher rate on money that is idle. The only downside to Capital One is that deposits take about two days to post. That is usually not as issue for me. The other drawback is that there is a five day deposit hold on all savings account deposits. Again, this is not as issue for me. For anyone needing quick access to their funds can open a checking account with them and have immediate access based on Federal Reserve policy. Again, I love them and will keep using them.",2015-10-26

I can use my ATM card at locations around the world without a fee. The website is very easy to use to transfer money, upload a check, or check your balance. I had to contact customer service to have a new ATM card sent to me and I received a quick response and my new card was sent without a cost to me. The only downsides to the bank are you can not deposit a check over $5000 online or deposit foreign checks. You can however deposit a check greater than $5000 at a Capital One ATM machine that accepts checks. Other than these small inconveniences the checking account is perfect.",2015-10-24
648,Great online banking choice!!,22543,20928,Capital One,26220,3,"This bank is a great option for banking, if you don't need an actual branch to go to. I had great experiences with their customer service representatives. There were times I had complex questions and they were always answered correctly and pretty quickly. I've had very bad experiences with not getting the right answers from other banks that I would routinely call 3 or 4 times and ask the same question to see if I'd get the same answer twice. I don't feel the need to do that with Capital One 360! The best feature of their accounts is the Mobile check deposits. Being able to snap a picture of my check to deposit and submit it is truly awesome and such a time saver. One thing that was frustrating to me was how long it took to get my debit card. It seemed to take 3 weeks. The other thing was the hold time on deposits. It was typically 5 days. The first time it happened it made me upset. But now that I know I plan accordingly, and this is just a second account for me so fund availability isn't always urgent.",2015-10-22

It has never showed once, even after 3 days, I called and was told that they did not have any record of it, I yelled at the top of my lung, well, It appeared miraculously.<br/>3) CPO 360 doesn't pay interest for CD at the end of month like any other banks do, they pay one month after the opening of CD. Even though, this is very unusual practice, they never mentioned it anywhere. CPO 360 is a division not a bank.<br/>4) They manipulate my website to their advantage, they block me to enter certain information. They deleted the check information my husband entered.<br/>5) CPO 360 sends bills at the end of day recently, not beginning of the day like any other banks do. <br/><br/>Just be careful and alert. CPO 360 is not a bank, it is a division of Capital One NA. Bank should be honest and transparent.

651,Capital One 360 - Automatic Savings and Higher Yield,22403,20928,Capital One,25861,4,"Capital One 360 was a choice that had been recommended to me since the days it was formerly known as ING Direct Orange Savings account during my time in college. Worried about support options, and ability to have money be more easily liquid, I wasn't too convinced of using a savings account from an online-only bank. Still, considering many of us mostly do our banking online and rarely if ever interact with a bank teller, I became open to the idea and opened an account at Capital One 360. My main motivation was the interest rate of 0.75%, which today is a rarity among mainstream savings accounts, and which Capital One 360 is able to do due to its virtual versus brick and mortar presence.<br/> <br/>The sign-up and approval process was very easy, no more difficult than opening any other bank account. As a psychotherapist, I know that maintaining good savings habits is as much psychology as it is having the resources, so I appreciate Capital One's ability to link my Bank of America savings account to make monthly automatic deposits on a set schedule of one's choosing (bi-weekly, monthly, etc.). When you have the ability to set it and leave it running in the background, it makes it much easier to develop a savings habit toward your goals. I particularly appreciated the ability to have ""sub-accounts"" for different goals. As an independent contractor, its helpful to set aside money for taxes.<br/> <br/>I haven't had much experience with its customer services, but can't say I have run into glitches using it in the past two years. Like most modern banking, Capital One 360 includes a mobile app which allows for depositing checks by taking a snapshot and monitoring your account. Overall, I am pleased with Capital One 360.",2015-10-06
652,Beware! Don't Invest In This Bank's CD's!,22395,20928,Capital One,25828,1,"I recently took out a large Certificate of Deposit with this institution. After I had already taken out the CD, I found out that they would not let me assign a beneficiary to the CD account!!! The only options they offer are to go to the time and expense of setting up a Trust to put the account in, or I had to add the person to the account as a joint owner. Neither of these options are feasible for me. I should have checked into this before taking out the CD, but I have NEVER been told by ANY online or brick and mortar bank that I could not assign a beneficiary to a CD, so I didn't think it would be an issue. When I contacted upper management about this, they said that they would not consider changing this policy. They weren't even apologetic about it. Beware, CAPITAL ONE 360 IS NOT THE SAME INSTITUTION AS CAPITAL ONE. They each have their own separate policies regarding banking. My husband has a CD with Capital One, and they assigned a beneficiary to his account with no problem whatsoever. If you care about beneficiaries, do not take out a CD with Capital One 360!!!",2015-10-05
653,"Good, but not as vibrant as ING Direct",22261,20928,Capital One,25416,4,"Overall, I think Capital One 360 is really good and I have no real complaints. They acquired me as a customer when they purchased ING Direct. They changed colors and eventually simplified the log-in process. The basics are the same - easy transfers of money and better than average savings rates. I miss the personal touch of ING Direct and, possibly, better savings rates. With ING Direct, there were occasional fun and informative communications, offers and the savings rates changed. It was a unique experience and I thought they really valued me as a customer. Capital One is more formal, seems less personal and my rate hasn't changed. I would get a better rate if I switched to Discover, but I haven't. I'm used to the transfer process and haven't made the leap. Still, Capital One 360 rates are much better than typical bank rates!!",2015-09-11

Opening an account is easy enough, it requires very little hand holding and no phone calls or wait times. This bank initially piqued my interest because it requires no initial deposit and no hidden annual fees of any kind. You even earn a set amount of interest, the more you have available, the more you earn. They also do not charge for simple protections and security protocols, such as for fraud or identity theft. You also get a free start up check book of 25 and it is sent in the mail in no time. So far my experience has been great, the customer service is their to help if you have any problems or questions, as I had a couple queries and had to wait for only about 2 minutes before receiving a real talking representative. I would highly recommend this bank to anyone who doesn't want to pay for a monthly upkeep fee for a great service.",2015-09-10
655,The Overdraft Feature Is Cool,22213,20928,Capital One,1890,4,"Ive been with them since it was ING Direct and while their rates went down and I hate Cap One with a passion over a fraudulent late charge on a credit card 20 years ago, twice in the last year I accidentally over-drafted my account.<br/><br/>I have a $1000 overdraft. But the cool thing is both times I accidentally overdrew my account, I got an email telling me and both times I transferred money in from another bank and neither time was I charged ANY interest despite the 2-4 days it takes for the transfer.<br/><br/>I dont think they advertise that feature. And the amount they do charge for overdrafts is very reasonable but from my experience, as long as you transfer money in the same day of the overdraft, you wont pay ANY interest.<br/><br/>Their rates are not really competitive anymore so I dont keep much money with them. But for anyone that occasionally overdrafts, this account is hard to beat.<br/><br/>(I almost never overdraft but twice this year when dealing with paypal I messed up & had them take it from my capital one checking when I didnt have enough money there)<br/><br/>Not sure everyone will get a $1000 limit.

I always had the idea that a bank was a place where you go to see some stuffy suits, but I got tired of the terrible customer service of the traditional banks, so I decided to go the online route. After searching around, it appeared to me that Capital One had the best online banking terms around. Interest Rates are high, fees are low, as a matter of fact...I don't pay any fees for my savings accounts, transfers are quick, and the customer service is great. The nice part is that they give you a lot of online tools to help make your saving goals a success, and they make it very easy to manage all of your finances from one spot.

Their online interface is very easy to use. I can easily transfer money and see my added interest. When I've had questions about my account, I have called customer service and gotten quick and easy answers.

First, it takes 5 days to transfer money outside of the Capital One 360. That is a really long time, especially if you need to access that money quickly. We are trying to buy a house right now, and we've been saving our downpayment on Capital One. Since we can't access it quickly, we had to transfer it out of the bank.

Capitol One 360 emails you with updates and offers. Their interest rates are much higher than my local banks and they have many features on their website to help you track saving goals.

The auto withdrawal works great, I set up an amount to automatically be taken from my checking to be put into my CapitalOne 360 account, it worked great I never had any issues and took less than 5 min to set up, cancel, or change. While the interest rate has decrease from 2003 when I first started with them they are still competitive in the market with the interest rate they have.

It's a real help to me because sometimes I loose track of my monthly card balances. Capital One 360 checking paid off when my wife clicked on the ""adds friend"" offer, from her account and added me as a friend. Once I signed up through their email we both got a pretty decent bonus. Also I really do like my experience with their customer service department. I got locked out of my password and had to call in to reset it. They walked me through the process and were very patient with me. So I like their free checking and it is making my banking more pleasant. Easy to navigate web site. Sounds funny but I really like their red and white exclusive colors they use on the site. Great Bank all in all.",2015-07-16
664,Great online banking experience,21747,20928,Capital One,24231,4,"I've been with Capitol One 360 since the beginning (and even before, when the bank used to be ING Direct), and all in all, I've been really satisfied with it. I have a joint checking account with my husband as well as multiple savings accounts. I really like being able to open new savings accounts when needed -- we use them to budget for bigger expenses. I also like the ease with which I can send payments to others and transfer money between accounts. I haven't had many issues, and when I do, the customer service is polite and knowledgeable. The app is quite useful, as well. One thing I like about the switch to Capitol One is that now I have a place to make deposits if I need to, as well as more ATMs to choose from.",2015-07-12
665,Easy to use site with ability to categorize your funds for future goals,21742,20928,Capital One,24226,5,"I have been using CapitalOne360 (ING Direct) for over 10 years. Prior to the market crashing, it had some of the highest interest rates around. However, it no longer does. The interest rates are in line with every other bank. <br/>Even though interest rates are low, CapitalOne360 is still a great place to keep your money. Here's why I like it:<br/>1. I easily connected a bank account to download funds and can send funds up to 360 at anytime. Now they are out of my bank account and away from being spent as easily since it takes 2 or so days to get to the banks, then there is a few day hold, and then another few days to withdraw it into your bank. Now my funds are safe from me buying something without thinking <br/>2. When you do need to withdraw funds you have them in about 2 days. <br/>3. My favorite feature is that I can create sub accounts within that account with different nicknames. For example, I have a vacation account, a retirement one, and a new bathroom one. I can move funds or deposit funds into any of these accounts. It helps me keep track and keep focused on goals. Plus, I can change teenagers or delete accounts at anytime as my goals change. <br/>4. The last one is auto deposits. I have it set up where 360 takes out a certain amount from my bank account at specified days. This way I don't have to remember to put away the funds into savings, it does it for me <br/>There is virtually nothing I don't like about Capitalone360 except that I miss their amazingly high interest rates. However, at least they are in line with regular banking institutes and not lower.",2015-07-11
666,Better Banking 360,21736,20928,Capital One,24220,4,"Capital One 360 checking account is a breath of fresh air when it comes to banking. I am a person easily frustrated with many of the banking institutions and all of their fees for whatever they can think to charge for. I enjoy the kind people that are always willing to help when I call the customer service line. Anytime I lock because of using the wrong pin my card, which has happened one to many times cause I have too many numbers on the bran, it is always such a quick and simple process over the phone to get it unlocked or when I have questions about how to change my pin number they are always super helpful and nice. The fee free checking with them is also nice. Unlike many banks who charge super high over draft fees or even monthly fees for having an account 360 checking does not. A really cool feature that I have not found any where else is the over draft credit line. You can apply for a credit line that is specifically attached to your account to help if you do not have enough to cover a purchase. Just last week I went over by $3 at the store and since I have $25 overdraft credit line my purchase still went threw. I love the features of online check deposit also which saves me a trip to the bank. With many good things they also have their down side. Luckily this band does not have many but one I have found is that sometimes I just need to cash my check and not just deposit it and I cant do that with an online bank. Beyond that I have not found many down sides to banking online and I really love Capital One 360. I feel like its finally a bank that cares about me as a customer and not fattening their pockets with fees and inconveniences of other banks.",2015-07-10
667,Capital One 360 Rocks,21733,20928,Capital One,24217,4,"I just recently opened up several savings accounts with Capital One 360. The experience was very easy and took no time at all. The application process was quick and to the point. I was able to immediately link my current checking account to the 360 account to make my initial deposit. This did require a verification process where they first deposited small amounts into your account to verify the identity of the accounts. However, it took no time at all. I am trying to save so I like the idea of having a ""hold"" period on the funds before they will be released. Overall, I must say that I am completely satisfied with their service this far.",2015-07-09
668,Great choice for an online bank.,21730,20928,Capital One,24214,5,Capital One 360 is a great bank. I've been using it for years and they have a great online set up and mobile app. Their online setup is great and easy to understand. You can also use their mobile app to deposit checks with out having going to an ATM or step inside a bank. I haven't been inside a bank in years and do all of my banking online though Capitol One 360. This is a major convince as I don't want to worry about what time a bank is open or having to take off work to take care of my banking needs. Capital One 360 also has very few and low fees which means you keep more of your money. Having no minimum/set up fees make Capital One 360 a great choice for an online bank.,2015-07-08
669,The ease and convenience of banking with Capital One 360.,21727,20928,Capital One,24212,4,I have been banking with Capitol One 360 for four years and highly recommend them for online banking. I find the ease of use and the convenience of banking at any hour of the day or evening at my liking a big plus. The opening of the savings account was very easy and the terms explained in plain English easy to understand. The steps to link up the savings account to an existing checking account was simple. I really like the way multiple bank accounts can be linked up to the Capitol One 360 savings account to be very handy. I can easily transfer money to and from the savings account by clicking a couple of buttons. The interest rate paid on the savings account far exceeds that currently offered in any retail bank in my area. I also like the ability to operate an online brokerage account through Capitol One 360 and like the savings account directly with the brokerage account. The fees associated with the brokerage account are very reasonable. The multiple cash back offers to open various accounts in an added incentive to bank with this trust worthy online bank. I highly recommend Capitol One 360 and look forward to continuing my banking relationship for years to come.,2015-07-07
670,Capital One 360 - Beyond the Orange,21643,20928,Capital One,24066,5,"I have been a Capital One 360 member since well before it was officially known as such, but they haven't skipped a beat since being acquired by Capital One (Formerly ING Direct). They offer a variety of accounts, but I utilize both their Checking and Savings account services. Fees are thankfully quite low, and their overdraft policies are quite reasonable. The lack of physical branches is hardly noticeable thanks to being able to do just about all of your banking from your phone or PC. In the rare instances that I get paid with a check, it is wonderfully easy to snap a picture and have it deposited with their mobile app. Interest rates are low at just about any financial institution right now, but Capital One 360 provides a competitive interest rate for your emergency funds as well. I couldn't be happier with Capital One 360, and I'll likely continue to use them in the years to come.",2015-06-29
671,Capital One 360 - A m,21642,20928,Capital One,24065,4,"I have been a customer of Capital One 360 since Capital One purchased the account from ING direct.

672,Excellent on-line banking,21595,20928,Capital One,23973,5,"When I started using this on-line banking, the company was called INGDirect. It was my first and only experience with strictly on-line banking and since CapitalOne took over, it has gotten even better. I have a checking account that I very rarely They are very interested in helping you save your money! I can access the account anytime I want from my laptop, IPad or IPhone. I can connect external bank accounts to my checking account so that I can transfer money. If I have a question or problem, their customer service is excellent and available 24/7. Their website is very easy to learn and use.",2015-06-21
673,Like the mobile app,21593,20928,Capital One,23971,3,"We had capital one 360 checking and savings bank as our previous bank was purchased by them a few years ago. We were highly skeptical as we weren't sure of what our experience would be afterwards. They were very proactive in keeping us informed of what to expect and they did deliver on just that. the rates pretty much remained the same. We did gain a really cool mobile app that was so much better than our previous banks. It was pretty easy to use and had so many options. I found myself using that app more than I would go online to check my balance and do other necessary.<br/> <br/>I did not seem to mind about the bank takeover. I still was a little concerned as it did not have a particular branch that we could go to, but we found that the customer service was still up to par. I did feel that the few that I worked with were confident in the skills and abilities to get me an answer quickly.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>We also had a problem with a charge that we weren't sure we authorized on our account. I called up and they were able to get us more detail than our statement gave us.. All and all we would continue to work with this Capital One again",2015-06-20
674,Liked it better when it was ING Direct,21570,20928,Capital One,23931,4,"Capitol One 360 bought ING Direct about 3 years ago and successfully merged ING Direct into the Capitol One family. Since ING was very successful Capitol One kept many of the same key features that made ING so great. They kept the no fees/no minimums and they keep a higher than average interest rate which is why I stayed with them. Some of the things that I dislike is the fact that their customer service is not as friendly as it used to be. I can not point my finger on an exact incident; however they just don't seem as friendly. The mobile application works well however Capitol One made some security improvements (I guess) which while improved security (I guess) also made it harder for log on. My wife and I use a unique sign in name and have signed up with many sites with the same name (gmail, yahoo, aol, etc..). What are the chances that on our Capitol One 360 accounts both user names we use for everything were already taken within 2 days of changing the way we logged in from a number to a user name? It makes it harder to log on and we commonly forget our user names and have to call often to reset our passwords. Other than these minor complaints I would still recommend Capitol One 360.",2015-06-19
675,I Love My 360 Account,21559,20928,Capital One,23920,5,"I have had a checking account with Capital One 360 for over 2 years now. The application process was so simple when I opened an account with them no minimum deposit. And I received a $50 bonus just for opening the account! Even with some credit problems in the past, and being turned down by other institutions, Capital One 360 allowed me to open a checking account. Customer service has always went above and beyond my expectations of helping me with any problem I have ever had. I have never had to pay any fees to open or maintain this checking account. I would recommend this institution to anyone, even if you have been turned down by other banks. It is amazing! I love my Capital One 360 account!",2015-06-18
676,Happy to use CapitalOne360 as my Online Bank,21558,20928,Capital One,23919,5,"I have been a fan of online banking for several years. Originally, I had an account with IngDirect. They have had a long standing policy of not charging fees. This has carried over since they were bought out by Capital One about 2 years ago. I have a checking account with them, and get my social security check deposited directly there at the beginning of every month. I love it, because I can see the check within a few minutes of the electronic transfer taking place online.<br/> <br/>I love that they have overdraft protection and that there are no fees associated with it. If you overdraft, they will give you credit to cover the amount. When money is deposited to get back to a positive balance they charge you only a small amount of interest for the days you were over. This usually amounts to only a few cents.<br/> <br/>Recently, I got a call from them saying that there was some unusual activity going on with my account. I went online and saw that someone from the Netherlands had made some charges to my account. I called CapitalOne, and they agreed that someone had somehow gotten my credit card information from a transaction I made that may not have been secure. They immediately cancelled my card, and issued me a new card. I was able to dispute the charges online, and all of the money was credited back to my account. This all took place in the space of about 4 days including time to receive my new card. I could not have been more pleased.<br/> <br/>I would highly recommend this bank to anyone. Being able to do everything online saves me time and money.",2015-06-18
677,Best Middle of the Road,21468,20928,Capital One,23799,3,"Overall, I have no problem with Capital One's online website. I can do most things I go in to do (mostly check balances and maybe transfer from checking to savings). I sometimes only have a problem with the integration of all of their products. The layout of the website and mobile app are very different, and since I am mostly on the mobile app, it can be confusing when I get on a computer. Individually, they are both fantastic, but I do not understand why they are not more comprehensive in their use. Customer Service is alright, but they will usually direct you to online to try and fix a problem.",2015-06-11
678,Great Overall Bank/Experience,21459,20928,Capital One,23790,5,"I opened an account many years ago with Capital One 360 (when it was an ING Direct account). The savings rate interest was much better then, however, it is still competitive in today's economy. The interface is easy to use and offers some nice perks, like the ability to mail paper checks for free. They even pay the postage. My main complaint with Capital One 360 is the interest rate, as compared to other online banks like Barclay's which offers 1% and Capital One 360 is still at .75%. One of the best features of Capital One 360 is the ability to create savings accounts within your savings account. This is helpful if you have small savings goals like going on a vacation or purchasing a new vehicle. Overall, I am very satisfied with Capital One 360 and would recommend it.",2015-06-10
679,Perfectly fine online banking,21430,20928,Capital One,23742,4,I originally had an ING Direct account so naturally I was a little concerned when it turned into a Capitol One 360 account. But I am happy to say that it has been a smooth turnover and I have had absolutely no problems. It is easy to manage and the interest rate if fairly competitive. Customer service took care of me quickly and politely.,2015-06-07
680,Just what I was looking for,21349,20928,Capital One,23585,5,"I was looking for a bank account to transfer funds from my freelance work earnings and use a debit card. After some research online I came across capital one 360 and a few others. I wound up applying for capital one 360 and am very satisfied with their electronic transferring features. I have used the smart phone app to deposit checks into my account, the deposit method is very fluid and easy to use. I have the account linked up to my amazon payments and paypal accounts and money transfers always happen within a day or two, very fast and haven't had a problem with it. I would say the best part of the account is the interest rate I get on the checking account, it's something that really only online checking accounts do and it is one the biggest pros. I would recommend to anybody who is looking for an online checking account for money transfers.",2015-05-31
681,One of the Greatest Banks!,21347,20928,Capital One,23583,5,"I have been a customer of 'Capital one 360' back when it was 'ING'. My experience has been mostly all positive. When I opened my account they had one of the highest interest rate for the common bank account..now it's not so great. I've had to contact them a few times by phone maybe about 10 times in the 9 years that I have been a customer. My on the phone customer service experience has usually be excellent, except one time I did get someone that was pretty rude. I really enjoy the fact that they are up to date with technology and have some features that have been truly helpful to me lately. One in particular is the ability to take a picture of a check and have it deposited into your account. Now it does take quite a while for that type of deposit to post to your account but that feature really saved me when I was out of the country and needed to deposit a check in the bank. There is no minimum balance for my type of account and this really reduces stress for me since many times my balance is low but others times it can be high. Another great feature is that they do not charge ATM withdrawal fees and that's even if you are in another country. I would sincerely recommend this bank to anyone looking for a saving and even checking account.",2015-05-31
682,Been with them since ING Direct days,21295,20928,Capital One,23532,4,"When I heard that Capital One was taking ING over, I was a little worried. But there was no reason to, because virtually everything stayed the same. The interface is the same and pretty easy to navigate. They need more ATMS, because there are none around me where I live. I like this bank. The ability to scan a check and deposit it is good, but their mobile interface could use some slight tweaking. Sometimes I will get to the end and it will tell me that I have to do the whole process over. I wish their interest rate was a little higher. I have never had to call them with any issues, so I can't tell you how good their customer service is. The only way I would switch banks is if I was lured with a higher APY and lots of cash.",2015-05-27
683,Awesome!,21292,20928,Capital One,23530,5,"I've been using Capital One's 360 banking service for quite some time now. I have had no problems with this bank and it's great for students considering there's no fees and no minimum balance required. The nice thing about their website is that it's very intuitive and easy to navigate. Since it's an online service it's really easy to use and you don't have to drive to a bank. You can deposit your checks via direct deposit and it's a seamless process. I use an app on my phone to access my balance which is nice, I can easily see if I have enough money for something simply by going on my phone. If I need cash I can just find an ATM using their ATM locator on the website and get cash that way. I have had no problems with this bank so far and I can feel confident in saying I recommend them.",2015-05-27
684,A bit too secure at times,21290,20928,Capital One,23528,3,"I went with 360 because of the name and the reputation. Their online banking is great, their apps are great. Can do all my banking easily from my phone. My last bank had an online banking platform that was horrible. My one issue is that the account gets frozen from time to time for ""unusual activity"" if I'm traveling, but they are quick to reinstate it when I call back.

685,web review,21289,20928,Capital One,23527,4,I tend to deal with Capital one 360 on a daily basis. This is the account that I use for my main account. The option that i love the most is their online/web site and app that can be used to deposit a check by just taking a picture of it on your phone. That save me a trip to the actual bank to conduct my transaction. Also it give me the ability to check ally account on the fly as I go though my daily work. The site is quick and clear to work with.,2015-05-26
686,Recommend it but there are pros and cons,21279,20928,Capital One,23516,3,"I have both a checking and a savings account with capital one's online bank, capital one 360. I don't get charged any fees for the basic accounts I have which is nice, and the option they have for direct deposit lets me get all of my earnings from my freelance work I do on various websites, which is very convenient. The access to accounts and account options that are available online are fantastic, and in my opinion, better (and more) options than I get from my regular non-online bank. The checking account is also great to have if you need to transfer money between two capital one accounts of any kind and the fact I have a debit card to access these funds makes life easier. The one complaint I have (which is a pretty big one) is that if I have cash I want to deposit, I can't just go to an ATM (or even a capital one branch for that matter). The ONLY options to add money to this online account are to get direct deposit or to upload a picture of a check and wait about 3-5 day's to access the money from the check. Though it's nice that both of those options exist, I really wish I could make a cash deposit somehow. That right there is why my review is 3 stars. If I could make a cash deposit, not only would I make this my only way of banking but I would also give it a 5 star review.",2015-05-25
687,I am really happy with my bank,21270,20928,Capital One,23497,5,"I have been using Capital One 360 for years now. I have a checking and savings account with them. At first they were just an add on bank, that I used for my online transactions and supplemented my brick and mortar other bank. I had it set up to pull a small amount from my other bank each month to ""pay myself first"" that went directly into my savings account. This helped me build up a nice little savings account much quicker than I would have without it. It was so easy and user friendly to do. I am somewhat computer savy, so I thought it was a breeze. The checking account I seldom use for actually writing checks these days, but I do use it for my handy debit card almost daily. I love being able to jump online and transfer money between my checking and savings account INSTANTLY. This is a function none of my brick and mortar banks could match. I have since made this my main bank. The website is clearly laid out and great to get in and out of quickly to do my bank business without much fuss or muss. I have access on my smart phone as well, but I admit I do 99 percent of my bank transactions on my laptop. I have never stepped foot in this bank and have not missed it in the least bit. I feel that the only thing that would make this bank better is if it offered more global services, but as a domestic bank it ranks pretty close to top in my book. It does not hurt that my old brick and mortar banks were gouging me senseless with fees and this one has none. I really like my bank.",2015-05-23
688,Great Online Savings Account!,21264,20928,Capital One,23491,5,"I have used Capital One 360 as an online savings account for several years now. This account is so convenient and easy to use, but it also helps me save more money. The account connects directly to my regular checking and savings account for seamless and smooth transfers between them. I like the idea of having a savings account that is online because it is harder to access my money. When I request a transfer to my checking account, it takes several business days to show up and become available. This gives me time to really determine if I need to purchase the item I am transferring the money for! I could not recommend more this account to someone who struggles to keep their money in savings! It has done wonders for me and Iâ€™m certain it could for anyone else, too.",2015-05-23
689,Sweet Sign Up Bonuses,21171,20928,Capital One,23336,5,"To be honest, you should wait until Capitol One 360 runs another one of its sign-up bonus promotions to enroll. I got fifty dollars for opening a checking account and two hundred for opening a savings account. They usually run these deals around the 4th of July and possibly other major holidays. I also enjoy a higher interest rate in my savings account than the median, even though it's still a paltry 0.7% or something. It's not my primary bank, which is still a physical bank. But in this era of internet, mobile apps, and convenience I hardly go to the physical bank anyway, which is the only difference between Capitol One 360 and traditional banks.

I have been with them for checking since it was ING Direct and have always been pleased. They offer a reasonable interest rate for their overdraft protection, which has come in handy more than once! I don't pay a monthly fee for my checking account and have never had any issues when writing a check or using my debit card for purchases. I will admit they are a bit limited in ATM locations (the nearest one to my home in a major city is probably five miles away) but I have learned to plan ahead when I will need to have cash on hand. Taking pictures of my checks for depositing is super convenient! There is a two day hold on deposited checks, but I think this is the norm for any financial institution. In the beginning I had reservations about banking with an online institution but have been nothing but happy with all aspects of my banking, much more so than when I banked at a local credit union. I am very satisfied with my experience with Capitol One 360 checking and highly recommend them to others!",2015-05-10
691,C 1 360,21073,20928,Capital One,23179,5,"Not only does Capital One 360 offer interest for their checking accounts (you get to earn money for using your account!), but they have NO account minimums after the initial deposit and offer sweet overdraft protection. That alone is better than most traditional brick and mortar banks. Not only that, but since they are the best bank ever, if you refer friends to sign up as well you can earn some extra cash. To take it even a little further, whenever I have had to call them (only to check on my account when I wasn't around internet connection, not for any big problems) I was immediately connected to a real live human being that I could understand clearly and who was incredibly friendly and helpful. That just about did me in, and I submitted to only having this internet banking account for now on. <br/> <br/>Oh yeah, you're also able to make free transfers to other bank accounts instead of writing out a check! Super convenient to send family and friends money if I need to. AND! their app actually works! I used to be signed up with a local bank... and a different online banking company and their apps never loaded. Capital One 360's does! I can do everything from the app if I want!<br/> <br/>With direct deposit and the ability to upload checks with pictures from my tablet, I have almost everything I need. The only thing I have not figured out is if I get cash as a gift, I cannot deposit it... Still working on figuring out if I can snap photos of money orders or cashier checks in order to upload them... Either way, I am 200% pleased with this bank and would recommend them to everyone!

692,review of CapOne 360,21069,20928,Capital One,23175,4,"I've been with CapitolOne 360 since it was Orange (then INg , and so on), several years, anyway. I've never had a reason to leave. I've got a checking, a savings and an IRA with them (though that's now part of ShareBuilder). If I could change anything, I'd have had them skip all these mergers and such, but as far as my day-to-day experiences - I think it's great!<br/>I've moved around a lot in the last 10 years - 4 different states altogether. My online accounts have been a godsend because I've not had to worry about opening and closing accounts and hoping that there wouldn't be accidental overdrafts. I do keep one local account just in case I need to access cash in a hurry, run into a merchant or vendor who is uncomfortable taking an 'out of town check' , or as an alternative to my 360 debit card. What can I say, I like a backup plan. (I've noticed fewer and fewer merchants balking at the idea of an online bank without a brick and mortar address by the way.) <br/> <br/>Transfers between accounts including my ShareBuilder accounts and my local brick and mortar bank are super easy and usually only take a day or so. At first, this was a little painful to get used to - moving money around doesn't happen instantly. But it's still easier than remembering to go to the bank before it closes!<br/>The online payment center is one of the best I've used - and in the last decade, I've used several. It's actually one of the main reasons I made CapOne360 my main bank. There always seemed to be some payment lost or processed at the wrong time with other institutions I used. Like I said, I moved around a lot in the last several years, and in a couple of cases my local bank or credit union had no branches in the new city, so I'd have to switch anyway. <br/>I like the bill reminders and especially getting my statements right in the Bill Pay Center when they are available.<br/>I highly recommend this bank to anyone thinking of getting an online deposit account.",2015-05-03
693,Capital One 360 gives you full visibility!,21033,20928,Capital One,23124,4,"I have had a Capital One 360 Checking account for over year now and I have been pleased. I have had a credit card with Capital One for over three years and decided to consider a checking account when fraudulent information had been discovered on my previous account and my bank was poor in their handling of the situation. Prior to signing up with Capital One 360, I spoke extensively with a customer service rep about my situation and their security policy. I asked so many questions and they answered every one in detail and never seemed to lose patience with me. The online banking feature is great. I can access my account on my computer or phone. The secured log in is strict but not inconvenient. I can transfer funds, pay bills, and deposit checks from my phone in seconds. The interest rate is on par with other accounts I have researched. Every time I have a question, support is available online or on the phone. I have had nothing but a positive experience with Capital One 360 and its Internet Banking.",2015-04-28
694,Never drive to the bank again...,21026,20928,Capital One,23117,4,"I first started with just a savings account because the interest rate was great. I then opened a few more savings accounts to keep different monies separate. Last year I opened a checking account and it was so easy. I have always done everything online. I deposit checks on my phone, which is so great and easy. I do have a local bank where I have my 360 account linked so I can transfer money easily. I get an email alert when a check has cashed and I can log in to get a detailed account of all activity on any of my accounts. I just recently called customer service to ask a question and the call was answered quickly, I spoke with a real person, and the conversation was pleasant. I would highly recommend Capitol One 360 as a great bank for both savings and checkings.",2015-04-26
695,Capital One 360 Fan,20975,20928,Capital One,23036,4,"I was skeptical at first when Capital One 360 took over my ING accounts. I had ING for years and was a huge fan. I thought that this could only be a bad change. However, it has actually been a good change. Capital One 360 is actually even easier to use than ING. Their mobile app is great. It has higher mobile deposit limits than my brick and mortar bank. This means even though my employer refuses to offer direct deposit, I can deposit my check by taking a picture with my smart phone. I have a hard time getting to the bank so this is such a valuable feature for me. I also love that the checking account pays interest. Yes, the interest is really low right now but at least they offer it. The savings accounts also have a better interest rate than most brick and mortar banks. They also take security seriously. I'm a big fan of Mint but not everyone is comfortable giving their banking sign in info to a third party site. Capital One 360 deals with this by giving you an access code to share instead. I also appreciate that they have a referral program.",2015-04-22
696,Used to be better,20613,20928,Capital One,22519,4,"I've had a checking account and savings account with Capital One 360 since it was called ING Direct. The initial draw is the sign-on bonus (I've seen it as high as $75) and the interest rate for savings, which used to blow traditional banks out of the water. It was around 4 percent when I first got my accounts, but it has been below 1 percent for a few years now. I know this is true to other banks as well, but still, Capital One/ING was always much higher than traditional banks. Now there is no big draw to keeping the majority of my savings there. <br/> <br/>Also, transfers from Capital One to another bank takes forever, around 9 days in my experience. But the reverse, transferring from another bank to Capital One, is 3 days tops. Why does Capital One take so much longer? <br/> <br/>Some positives: mobile deposits, no minimum balances and no fees for simply having an account. And per an email I received in mid-October 2014, you can now deposit cash via ATMs.",2015-03-22

I am about to have my work check automatically deposited in my account every month. This saves me time and money. I am able to check my account online throughout the week to make sure my balance is where it needs to be. I really enjoy the different features offered with this credit card. They include free checking with no hidden fees, no overdraft fees, no atm charges and no monthly fees. I had a horrible experience with my old bank in which I had a problem with charges and over draft fees, but there is no need to worry with Capital one 360.

The money is available a day after I make my deposits, and I was given free checks and a free debit card. I was also able to link it to my other bank account for free transfers back and forth.

I greatly enjoyed the ease of use, sleek but minimal interface, and the ability to create multiple checking/savings accounts for different uses, such as personal spending, emergency funds, etc. Since being bought by Capital One, all of these services remain fully intact, but they've added a wide variety of enhancements along the way as well, such as being able to deposit checks via a picture from your smartphone, and the ability to easily order checkbooks for your checking accounts. In the few instances where I have had to contact the bank directly via phone, their representatives have been very helpful and knowledgeable about what I was trying to accomplish.

700,Banking Online with CapitalOne360 - No Fees!,20285,20928,Capital One,22157,5,"CapitalOne360 bank has been around about a year. Previously they were called IngDirect. I started banking with IngDirect back in 2011. I have been with this bank for over 3 years. The thing I like is that you can do everything from their website. It is well organized and easy to understand. You can view all of your most recent transactions or see previous months organized into printable statements. I never use cash anymore. I do everything with my CapitalOne360 Bankcard. It's great because transactions show up immediately. I always know exactly what my balance is and where my money is going. If you use a program like Quicken or your own spreadsheets in Excel, you can download your transactions in a spreadsheet format or as a comma delimited file for import. CapitalOne360 makes it easy to pay people by transferring money to their account. I pay all my bills electronically at the beginning of the month. This lets me keep track how much I have left over for the month, and it's good for the environment since I don't get paper statements anymore. The customer service at this bank is excellent. Representatives are always friendly, and are able to answer any of my questions in detail. The best part is this bank does not have any fees. If I am ever overdrawn, I am only charged daily interest on the money they are covering. If I overdraw, it literally only costs me a few cents when my account is replenished the next month. I can't recommend them highly enough.",2015-02-23
701,Capital One 360,20251,20928,Capital One,22103,4,"My experience with Capital one 360 has been good so far. Originally I had ING Orange online banking, but it was later acquired by Capital one and renamed 360. The good about Capital One 360 would mostly likely to be the fees. No fees for a lot of services such as: free ATM , free check mail via USPS, and not even over draft fee, which would be over $30 at least in traditional brick and mortar banks. The cons about it would most likely to be making a deposit, since the only form of deposit I can make it is thru checks; either directly deposit online or mail them the check I want to deposit, which is very inconvenient if I want to deposit cash, Iâ€™d really wish they can offer some way of depositing cash. On the other hand, depositing checks online thru the mobile app takes a rather ""long"" time, the money wonâ€™t be there until after 3 days or more; it would be so much better if it just takes 1-2 day to process.",2015-02-19

703,my online experience.,20141,20928,Capital One,21925,5,I recently viewed information online where I could receive fifty dollars for opening an online checking account with capital one. For fifty bucks I said what the heck I can use fifty dollars. The requirements to receive the fifty dollars were open the account with a transfer from an active checking account and make three debit card transactions within forty five days. On the fiftieth day fifty dollars would be deposited into my capital one account. This seemed like a great deal so I made the initial deposit. Capital One has more than lived up to what was advertised. The account came with overdraft protection. Where I can overdraft up to my credit limit and instead of receiving an overdraft charge. I have a line of credit where the overdraft amount is charged at a reasonable interest rate until paid. Customer service is excellent. I have had a couple of minor issues that customer service quickly resolved for me. Also anyone I refer I receive a twenty dollar referral fee up to fifty referral. As long as the service remains this good capital one has a faithful customer.,2015-02-11
704,Capital One 360 free checking with interest,20095,20928,Capital One,21872,5,"I opened my Capital One 360 checking account last year in November when they offered a promotion that resulted in a nice bonus deposit after using the checking account for three months. I did receive the bonus indeed in January. I love having this checking account as it allows me to deposit checks by scanning them in from my cell phone. I first had some issues with the scanning process with my first check but I still was able to deposit it after a couple of tries and so far I have yet to find a check that I could not deposit that way. This is a very convenient feature. I also like this account because it charges no fees without requiring to carry a minimum balance or using direct deposit, and on top of it you even get to collect a little bit of interest on your balance. I still have another checking account at a brick and mortar local bank but I have to admit I find myself using my capitol one checking account more and more lately. I used my local branch at the other bank mostly to deposit checks which now I can do from the comfort of my home. Thank you Capital One 360!!!",2015-02-08

The customer service is also great, whether you call or use email, they respond in a timely manner. They also offer ways to deposit checks by taking pictures, that means being able to make deposits from the comfort of your own home. I recently also added a checking account and am looking into possible opening a CD with them as well.

Each time I log on, the site is very secure and any wrong information will be sent back to you and you will have to redo. They take several security measures. As a online account it is easy to make transfers, set up direct deposit and pretty much like any other stand alone bank.

I'm very glad I stuck with the bank because Capital One 360 has been great. They have added more local ATM machines and have made it much easier to make deposits, but with cash and checks. Customer service is just as helpful and easy to reach as they were before the buyout. The website experience is safe and very easy to use. I have had a couple of issues with the mobile app, but nothing major. Every once in a while I'll get an error message, but when I re-enter my username and password, it seems to work again. All in all, I would definitely recommend this online bank to my friends and family.",2015-01-10

710,ING now Capital One 360,19500,20928,Capital One,21101,5,I have had a savings accounting through Capital One 360 (formerly ING Direct) for the past 9 years now. They have always had competitive savings account interest rates. I signed up for a checking account through their electric checking as soon as it was available. The fees are pretty much nonexistent with this bank. I love how easy and quick everything is done through the website and mobile application. I have never had any problems with them. They also offer a brokerage Sharebuilder that has very reasonable transaction fees that I occasionally use as well. I love how all my accounts seemingly integrate effortlessly. I just hope there are not any major changes after being acquired by Capital One. I plan on doing my banking through them for my foreseeable future and long term.,2014-12-29
711,Why I Use Capital One 360,19230,20928,Capital One,20805,5,"I am currently enjoying my experience as a Capital One 360 customer because there are virtually no fees, no minimum requirements, and no catches (that I have identified so far in the last 2 years of service). As of now, the current annual yield is 0.75%, which is reasonably competitive, especially when one considers the reality of no minimums or fees. I think another great feature is that it is very simple to link accounts to other banks and set up automatic transfers to make saving easy and schedule. There are also a variety of options provided to ensure you are saving appropriately and the customer service is not bad. So overall, this bank has a great account system, a competitive savings rate, and a helpful customer service team. Its a very good consideration when choosing banks to store your hard earned cash.",2014-12-16
712,Capital One 360 is the best,19136,20928,Capital One,20713,5,"We have been banking with ING Direct for 10 years and to say we were extremely hesitant when they got taken over by Capital One would be an understatement. We were very worried that they would mess with ING's no hassle, easy going ways. Well, we needn't be worried because things are just as easy and seamless as they were with ING. The website is extremely easy to use, and the app is good, too, except they occasionally have buggy things happening. Overall, we are very pleased with our experience with Capital One 360 so far. Their rates are some of the best being offered right now, and their fees are minimal. We have savings accounts, CDs and a checking account and we have very few complaints. This is great banking, especially for people who don't mind not having a local branch nearby. We love being able to use the mobile deposit feature as well. Just take a photo of your check and in it goes.",2014-12-04
713,Capital One 360 worth checking out,19131,20928,Capital One,20708,5,"Several years ago, my wife and I got fed up with brick and mortar banks with there fees for EVERYTHING. There were fees to speak with tellers and fees to use the ATM. There were fees for using your debit card. You name it - there was a fee. <br/> <br/>We signed up for a bank account with ING Direct. They promised low fees and higher interest rates than traditional banks. We were impressed that they were able to deliver. Several years ago, ING Direct was bought out by Capital One 360. We have been pleased by the move. <br/> <br/>Capital One 360 has relationships with a various ATM providers. We can withdraw money from various ATMs without charge. To deposit checks, we simply sign the back of the check and take a photo of the check with our ipad. We have never had a problem. <br/> <br/>When the change over first occurred, we received a giant stack of mailings, new cards, and more information than we could process. We called Capital One and spoke with a customer service representative who walked us through several important changes. We were able to request new cards, due to some confusion. Our service was very professional and prompt. <br/> <br/>I would recommend to friends and family.",2014-12-03
714,One of the originals and still great,19118,20928,Capital One,20695,5,"Capital One 360 has been around since online banking was fairly new (at least in their ING incarnation). They seem to have the formula for how internet banking is supposed to be handled. I appreciate many of the features that their easy-to-use website offers, but none more than their instant transfer of funds between other Capital One 360 users. My entire family banks with them and we are distributed virtually all over the country. With the ability to instantly transfer funds between account holders for no fee, it makes all of our lives much easier (and more affordable). I can effortlessly transfer funds to my boys attending college and automate the process of essentially providing them with an allowance (they hate it when I call it that), and I have the ability to get funds to them quickly if an emergency arises. This has provided me with great peace of mind. It's definitely cheaper (as in free) than all of the third-party money transfer services, and the funds are immediately available for them to use. Pretty darn convenient. Overall I am extremely satisfied with the level of service I have received from Capital One 360 and will be keeping them as my go-to bank for personal finances.",2014-12-01

I first started out with their credit card, and I loved it so much I decided to switch all my services over to them. <br/> <br/>There online Apps make life so much easier. I can now manage my money, and pay my bills right there online. With the tech era going strong, this is a must have for any bank to compete out there.

The competitive rates on the savings account are the original reason I signed up for this online bank. The website interface is easy to use and the content is organized in an intuitive manner. Setting up external accounts and transfer money amongst said external accounts is painless. My only complaint is the user login process is a bit cumbersome than other online banks I have used. There seems to be an extra layer of authentication that this bank uses with a customer ID, logo identification, and numerical pin. However, if this is what it takes to provide internet security then I am ok with the extra steps.",2014-11-17
718,Capitalizing On Capital One 360,18819,20928,Capital One,20281,5,"If you want the convenience of a great online bank without worrying about travel, a great suite of banking products and tools, a pretty good mobile app, great customer service, and hassle free transactions, then look no further than Capital One 360. <br/> <br/>First, Capital One 360 offers excellent customer services. Banks tend to be notorious for customer service that isn't loved by their customers, but Capital One, as a whole, has been a wonderful experience for me. I had a question about the money bonus for opening up a savings account with them. I opened up a chat with them and was with someone speaking about the issue in mere moments. They clarified how to get the bonus and what I had to do to be eligible. I believe I got $125 JUST for opening a new account which cost me nothing! I don't believe there is even a minimum you have to maintain in the account. I don't think there is a deposit minimum either, but if there is, I think it is no more than $5, which is awesome. Beyond that, I've only had to use customer service one other time, which was a phone call to inquire about ATMs that accept the card in my area. That was a painless experience and the rep was friendly and knowledgeable. <br/> <br/>As an online bank, the online banking experience is of course what matters most for Capital One 360, and it does not disappoint. As an IT guy, I appreciate that they have you set up a username/customer ID and then a PIN (separate from your card PIN) to login to the website, which was it twice as hard for hackers to ruin your day. The website is bright and colorful (red, white, and blue), without being tacky. The user interface is intuitive and easy to learn. There's a lot to click, but there's almost always a help bubble or applicable FAQ link near or under a button or link. You can see all your account balances on the summary page. You also have access to tabs that will show you your transaction history, pending charges, check orders, account info, and so much more. Ordering checks is just a matter of having $5.00 deducted from your account and then waiting 7 or so days. NO phone call or middle man. I've done 6 transfers on the website to my credit union account and they were all free. I've also done transfers TO this account which was also free and easy. Another neat feature is the ability to set up a savings plan. For instance, I like to save $20 per pay check, but don't want to be tempted to spend it by having the cash on hand. So, I set up a schedule for the $20 to be taken from the account that gets my check direct deposited and Capital One pulls that money from the account on the day(s) of my choosing and puts it into a savings account (of which I can have multiple). No piggy bank or temptations! There are other neat things about 360, but one of my favorite things is the ability to deposit checks without having to leave your home. You can either use their mobile app to take a picture of the check and upload that, or upload a picture of the check right off of your computer. Either way, it is a simple process and I've never had an error having my check processed or rejected. The mobile app looks really good and is pretty simple to use, though it is a bit cluttered and a little slimmer on features compared to the site, which is expected. I like Capital One's credit card app better, but the 360 app still gets the job done. <br/> <br/>In conclusion, I haven't tried any other online banks, but Capital One 360 has shown me how incredible and convenient they can be. Being able to deposit a check or make numerous transactions while in my pajamas is a gift from the banking gods. I'm satisfied, and anyone else who used the service would be too.",2014-11-14
719,Simply the best!,18815,20928,Capital One,20277,5,"I decided to open an account with ING Direct years ago for the high savings account interest rates that were much better than any of the local banks (savings account rates were higher than local CD rates!). Over the years, the interest rates have dropped (and the bank changed to Capital One 360), but the customer service, ease of use, and higher-than-local returns have not changed. <br/> <br/>Some of my favorite features of banking with Capital One 360 include referral bonuses that are easy to collect once you tell your friends about the great interest rates. The website is also extremely easy to use and ahead of its competition: I remember digitally depositing checks through a mobile app years before the larger banks implemented the system. You can also set goals for each of your savings accounts to help you stay on track with your finances. A huge convenience is the peer-to-peer payment system: I've used this to send money to my brother (who banks elsewhere) to easily split the cost of big Christmas presents for our parents. <br/> <br/>When I have had an issue (I once was declined at a gas station in the middle of a freezing cold winter storm), I have been able to connect to a customer service agent immediately--no listening to a lengthy recording or being redirected through a ton of departments. The customer service department was quick to respond and solve the problem. <br/> <br/>I've been a customer of Capital One 360 (formerly ING Direct) for nearly a decade, and I can't foresee changing that relationship.",2014-11-13

I love the no overdrawn fees feature with my small overdraft line of credit. It is very simple to transfer between 360 Checking and Savings, as it's instant.

Instead of paying $35 at a typical bank for overdrawing $0.01, Capital One 360 will charge interest on the amount overdrawn. This results in far less penalizing fees. Their site is easy to navigate- never had a problem finding what I needed. The few times I needed to contact customer service have been a breeze.

When Capital One bought out ING, I was a little nervous that they might change the rules or policies, but other than the colors on the website changing, I have hardly noticed any difference. It is still a very convenient home for my savings account; I set up automatic transfers from my checking account and can also make additional deposits whenever I have extra money to deposit. I have a debit card that allows for quick/emergency access to my account if I need it, but I try not to use it. I highly recommend Capital One 360 as an online banking service.",2014-10-24
724,Great online bank,18419,20928,Capital One,19782,5,"Capital One 360 is a great online bank for all of your banking needs. I have used this bank for a variety of reasons, including checking, savings, and CD accounts and all experiences were exceptional. The terms of each account is easy to understand and every question of mine was answered. Each time I contacted customer service they were quick to respond and help me. The rates area also great! The online site and app are easy to use and navigate. I love using capital one 360!",2014-10-21
725,Pretty Good,18398,20928,Capital One,19761,4,I feel secure when using this website and processing banking transactions. The customer service is very good - any time I have a transaction I receive continual updates on the status. One thing that I do not like it the time it takes to transfer money in to the account and have it be available. I transferred money from a linked bank account and it took 7 days to access the funds. It is very quick to withdraw money into a linked account (about 2 days). The website is bright and easy to navigate. Overall I am pleased with CapitalOne360.com,2014-10-16
726,Capital One 360 Savings Account,18377,20928,Capital One,19741,5,"I started using Capital One 360 a year ago and have had a great experience with them thus far. There is no minimum amount required to be in your savings account and there are no annual fees, which was a major plus for me as I am a college student. Capital One 360 makes it simple to deposit checks from work. I can either choose to have my checks direct deposited into my savings account or I can deposit my check through their mobile app while sitting in my bed. I even gain a variable interest from the savings account. Overall, I would suggest online banking with Capital One 360.",2014-10-12
727,Great Online Banking,18372,20928,Capital One,19736,4,"I have been very impressed with the checking and savings account I have through Capital One 360. I am most satisfied with my ability to view my purchases online and deposit my checks using checkmate. I really like being able to use checkmate's app to take a picture of my checks with my phone and then deposit them. This saves me a lot of time because I don't have to drive to my local bank to deposit checks anymore. They also have a Bill Pay service and provide me with a Mastercard debit card, which I can use pretty much everywhere debit cards are accepted. One of the things I like most is how they deal with overdrafts. Instead of charging me an outrageous fee everyday my account is negative, they offer you a line of credit where interest accumulates, and you only have to pay the interest on the amount you overdrew. I have overdrawn my account on several occasions to pay bills and have paid a low amount of interest compared to the large fees other banks charge. Overall, this is a great online banking account and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a checking and savings account.",2014-10-11
728,The One,18364,20928,Capital One,19728,5,"i have been with Capital One 360 for over 3 years now, i have never had a problem with them since the day I joined with them, they always make sure that I get what I need and get it without fuss. Internet banking with them is so fast and reliable because of their secure server. Oh and let me add I this, you always get what you need from them just ask client representative and they will show it to you step by step. That's why I don't have any complaints. It's fun it's easy and payment processing doesn't take too long. I would recommend this to anyone who might read this review tell your friends that Capital One 360 is the one.",2014-10-10
729,Surprisingly good experiences with CapitalOne 360!,18105,20928,Capital One,19341,5,"I was a long-time customer of ING Direct and was so happy with that bank. I was extremely distressed when Capital One took over, and nearly closed my account. I'm so glad I didn't, because Capital One has really done a good job of retaining what made ING so great in the first place. Customer service is quick, friendly, and helpful. I have savings, a Money account for my teen, and checking through them. When I deposit money, it's slower than a brick and mortar, but still quick enough that I can use the cash a few days later. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this bank.",2014-09-29
730,"Once great, now average at best",18099,20928,Capital One,19335,4,"I have had an account with Capital One 360 (formerly called ING Direct) for about 7 years now. It was a great bank, back when the interest for a savings account was around 4 percent to 5 percent and the signing bonus was upwards of $50. Now, the interest rate is less than 1 percent and has remained as such for a couple years now. My accounts (checking and savings) are still open, but the majority of the money kept in them have been moved elsewhere. <br/> <br/>Beyond that, I've always hated the login format for ING/Capital One, which shows as an ATM-type number pad, rather than a traditional password. I find all-number passwords to be harder to remember, and the pad is a pain to use from a laptop trackpad (you cannot use the numbers on your keyboard, only the faux number pad). ING/Cap1 also takes longer to transfer funds than other banks that I use, typically a week or longer, compared to 2 to 3 days with other banks. <br/> <br/>I used to be fine with those issues when the interest rate was high. There just isn't anything that makes ING worth it anymore.",2014-09-28
731,Customer Review of Services,18096,20928,Capital One,19332,5,"I have banked with Capital One 360 for the past couple of years. Previously the bank was ING Direct, and I enjoyed their services as well for at least five years prior to the switch. I enjoy this online bank because they offer competitive interest rates, easy bill pay, easy and fast savings plans, and friendly customer service. On the one occasion that I had to actually pick up the phone and call them because my internet service was down, the attendant took care of my transfer request in a fast and friendly manner. I appreciated the security questions I was asked prior to the transfer. Their website is easy to use, and it is very secure. I appreciate and value this online bank.",2014-09-28
732,Capital One Direct formerly ING Direct,18080,20928,Capital One,19316,4,"I have been internet banking for about 8 years, and recommend it to ALL my friends. Capital One 360 (formerly ING direct) has given me a great experience with internet banking. When my husband and I started our account 8 years ago, we had just finished college and were starting out with little to nothing and were only able to tuck a little away with each paycheck, so we wanted a Savings Account that would offer us 3 things: an excellent interest rate, little or no fees on withdrawal, and instant access to our account. Capital One has given us all three and we love it! While we started out at a spectacular interest rate of 4%, that has fallen considerably to about .75%. Still, with other savings account competitors rates coming in at around .25%, we are still getting a great rate. We have made numerous withdrawals and deposits from our regular checking account (linked electronically) and have NEVER paid any fees to transfer funds between the accounts. That in itself is pretty awesome. What's more, I feel extremely confident in the security platform that the Capital One group uses. In short, I have loved our experience with internet banking, and would highly recommend the experience to others!",2014-09-24
733,Great for Savings.,18071,20928,Capital One,19307,5,"We keep our savings and also our car maintenance ""sinking fund"" at Capital One 360. We opened both a savings and a checking account and received a monetary bonus for both accounts, which jump-started our savings. CO360 offers high interest rates for both checking and savings accounts and they don't charge monthly fees, which is awesome. I've never had an issue with either one of my accounts. Transfers between accounts are instantaneous and transfers to/from my ""brick and mortar"" bank only take a day or so. I really like working with CO360 and plan to keep my accounts there for as long as they continue their great service.",2014-09-22
734,Excellent Experience with Capital One360,18068,20928,Capital One,19304,5,"I have used this bank for about 3 years now. I started out with them when they were Ing Direct. A few months ago they were purchased by Capital One. I have never had a bad experience with them. I do practically everything online anyway. (I pay all my bills online for example). Their website is very well designed. Any recent transaction that doesn't go through immediately is listed as pending, so I always have a good idea of what my current balance is. Hyperlinks are provided for the sites of those who take out money from my account so I can get more information. <br/> <br/>They are linked with other Capital One products, so I can always see my credit card balance without having to log into that site separately. They offer overdraft protection, and the only fee they charge is the interest they are losing on that money while you are using it. This adds up to only a few cents. Their online site provides all the features you would get with a regular bank including the ability to see statements online. I have found that I really haven't missed the presence of brick and mortar branches. I highly recommend them to everyone.",2014-09-21
735,Capital One 360 Review,18062,20928,Capital One,19298,4,My wife and I opened a joint Capital One 360 Savings account as a way for us to save money for our wedding. We opened the account about one year before the wedding. The online registration process was simple and didn't take too long. We were able to easily link our separate local bank accounts to our Capital One 360 account online to make transfers back and forth. Transfers of money were quick (usually a couple of days) and could be done online or on our phones. It made saving for our wedding easy to do and easy to track. Overall I enjoyed my experience with Capital One 360 online banking.,2014-09-19
736,Savings account okay,17975,20928,Capital One,19164,4,"I have been using capitalone360 savings account since they bought out ingdirect savings accounts. Their rates are competitive versus other competitors and the interface is pretty user friendly and easy to use. I've had no problems reaching customer support and getting any questions answered. <br/> <br/>Withdrawals and deposits are in the account in a timely manner even though it could be a little bit faster. Just wished the saving rates would go higher. Overall, capitalone360 has been good to above average.",2014-09-16
737,ING Direct Now Capital One Rocks,17971,20928,Capital One,19160,5,"I have been a customer if ING Direct now Capital One for many years. I can honestly say that they are truly no hassle. Other online banking sites have blocked financial transfers for unknown reasons, made me show up at physical branches or call them in order to resolve problem. Not ING Direct. My experience with them has been rock solid using checking, savings and investment accounts. Their savings and investing accounts are truly set and forget unless you want to watch your money grow that is.",2014-09-15
738,ING Direct Savings Account,17822,20928,Capital One,18933,5,"I used ING DIRECT before it was taken over by Capital One 360, so my review is for that time period only. I stopped using it when it changed hands, but not out of dissatisfaction. I could no longer log-in to my account. I used their Orange Savings account. At the time, the interest rate was among the best. Savings rates have plummeted in recent years due to the economy, but ING always remained competitive. Their security was top notch- there were multiple layers to get into your account, so it would be almost impossible to hack into. My money was very easy to transfer or deposit from my bank account to the savings account. It was overall a stress-free, pleasant experience.",2014-09-09
739,The Best Online bank,17809,20928,Capital One,18920,5,"I was skeptical about signing up for the account at first, but the sign up bonus was a great incentive that convinced me to create the account. One year down the line, I love the fact that there are no account fees for this account or minimum balance requirements unlike most conventional accounts. The best part is that you can deposit checks using the mobile app and the interest rates on their accounts are jaw dropping and they increase based on your account balance. Lastly there are multiple accessible ATM's where you can withdraw money which comes at great convenience and their customer service line doesn't have a long wait time.",2014-09-07
740,Capital One 360 is the best,17807,20928,Capital One,18918,5,"I love my experience with Capital One 360. Actually, when I opened my account on June 2013, they gave me a $50 sign up bonus which is unexpected. I chose this because I also have Capital One Journey card. It is also awesome bank account for my teenage kids. I love how I can give them balance to their account so I can control on how they're spending. Overall, I'm happy with this bank. I will never close my account with them.",2014-09-06
741,Very user friendly,17802,20928,Capital One,18913,5,"I LOVE the Capital One 360 app and the bank! With other bank's apps, it is next to impossible for me to create images that are accepted for mobile deposits. I never have trouble getting Capital One to accept my image. The app is so user friendly and lets you pay bills, transfer money between accounts, or send money person to person with no effort at all. With competitive rates on saving and checking, and the great app, you can't go wrong with Capital One 360!",2014-09-05
742,Best savings account,17793,20928,Capital One,18903,4,"I think Capital One savings (formerly ING Direct) is one of the best internet banks around. As with many online banks, there are no fees to have an account which is an absolute must. I use them for their savings account (where I hold my emergency fund), which has one of the highest yields. It isn't the highest, but it is competitive enough that I don't feel the need to switch at the moment. Their website is easy to use, it's secure, and just overall very convenient. I can transfer money back and forth without ever going to the bank!",2014-09-03
743,Easy banking from anywhere!,17702,20928,Capital One,18747,5,"This checking was initially set up as a back up account for us, and quickly became my primary. The features are so easy to use and super convenient for the household CFO on the go! I have all my accounts linked, including my credit card, savings, checking and even my children's savings accounts. There is online bill pay that is so easy to use. Many ATMs with no fees. If I want to make a deposit but don't have time, simple, I just take a picture of the check and boom, done! The smartphone app is fantastic, allowing you to keep track of all of your accounts from the palm of your hand. They even keep track of my credit report for me. It doesn't get any better then this!",2014-08-28
744,Great for a first,17648,20928,Capital One,18633,4,"My experience with this bank was pretty fair. I had difficulties with my login, but that's probably my own fault. Customer service is amazing. Always helped with all my questions. My first bank of choice ever and I've liked it.",2014-08-24
745,Excellent Customer Service,17645,20928,Capital One,18630,4,"Capital One 360 is an outstanding bank. They have no fees for checking account. Their customer service is excellent. If you need to call them, you won't wait on hold forever like some banks, you get right through to a real person in America that speaks American English. They have always been very helpful and have solved whatever issue I had every time I had to call them.",2014-08-23
746,A Brief Review of Capital One 360,17635,20928,Capital One,18620,4,"Being a long time ING Direct customer, I admit I was a little skittish when Capital One announced they were buying the online banking services from ING. My fears were put to rest shortly after the transition, however, and I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with the bank. In the few incidents where I had to contact Capital One directly, they were extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and dedicated to service. I constantly move money around a variety of accounts, including Sharebuilder which they also acquired, and everything functions seamlessly. If you're looking for a great online bank that won't smack you with high fees, Capital One 360 is for you.",2014-08-22
747,Ideal Bank For Stable Savings Accounts,17633,20928,Capital One,18618,4,"ING DIRECT was sold to Capital One, so it is now called Capital One 360. My experience with with ING Direct prior to the name change, but I would imagine it is still of the same quality. <br/> <br/>I found ING Direct to be very user friendly, simple to use, and of great quality for the savings. If I were someone who had a lot in savings that I never needed and never transferred to other accounts, I would have remained with ING Direct. However, I had to go back to a regular checking/savings account with a larger bank. I recommend ING Direct very highly to those with stable savings accounts, which are left alone for a while to gain interest.",2014-08-21
748,My First Capital One 360 Account,17532,20928,Capital One,18428,5,"Recently, I opened a Capital One 360 account. A bit of research was conducted, just prior to opening the account. That research indicated that: the account would be a convenient asset for me, and that fees for maintenance of the account would be reasonable, and minimal. <br/> <br/>I navigated to the website, for the Capital One 360 account. The instructions for opening the account were simple, and easy to read & understand. I chose a username, and password. Next... I entered some basic contact information. Once this information was entered, I was required to link the Capital One 360 account to an existing bank account as verification of my identity. (this I did not like. however, I did understand the necessity.) Capital One 360 uses the tiny deposit method of verification a small amount is deposited into your linked account, and the user is required to verify the tiny amounts deposited. <br/> <br/>The verification process took just 2-3 days. Once I had verified my account that was it. <br/> <br/>I was able to begin use of the account immediately. <br/> <br/>The process was fairly quick, simple and painless. <br/> <br/>The site contains a listing of all required fees & accessories, which are all reasonable, and minimal, <br/>as anticipated.",2014-08-14
749,I love Capital One 360,17472,20928,Capital One,18324,5,"A few years ago I was looking for a way to deposit some money for a side job in an account that was separate from the joint account that my wife and I share. I wanted to keep it separate to pay some backed up bills and wanted to make sure we didn't spend that money on regular family stuff. One of the things that I really wanted was the ability to hook into my current checking account in case I wanted to move money back and forth. Another thing I wanted was free instant transfers between my online checking and any number of connected online savings accounts. I found both of these things in ING Electric Orange. Later, they were purchased by Capital One and it became Capital One 360. It's amazing. I have 9 different savings accounts. I deposit money into the checking account and have automatic transfers that go into the savings accounts. When I have enough to pay off something from one of the savings accounts, I pay it off and start over. It's literally perfect, I haven't had a complaint ever. Combine that with the great customer service the one time that I called them, and the fact that it has all of the other features of a regular bank, such as being able to take pictures of checks on my phone to deposit, it really is the perfect tool.",2014-08-11
750,Great Online Bank,17469,20928,Capital One,18321,5,"I have been a customer for years. I started banking with ING Direct which is now Capital One 360. The website is very easy to navigate, the menu and tabs are very user friendly. There are many ads that advertise the banks other services that the customer may find useful. You can easily set up other accounts to save money for different life events. You can also set up savings accounts for your children and deposit checks by taking pictures with a smart phone. Capital One 360 is a great internet bank!",2014-08-11
751,Bank Review,17457,20928,Capital One,18309,5,I have had this bank account ever since I applied for my capital one credit card five years ago. Initially I was hesitant about opening a bank account with a credit card company thinking they would just charge me a bunch of fees since that what credit card companies are about. I soon realized that the account was like any other bank account. I had no issues with fees and I have had no real problems to speak of. I give it a (5) rating.,2014-08-08
752,"Great Internet Bank, Slow at times",17444,20928,Capital One,18296,4,"Capital One 360 is a great bank, I love their mobile applications. In addition, I like their online banking. I think it is easy to use, and has a very professional/ user-friendly design. One thing I do not like about Capital One 360 is their customer service. I had an issue with not being able to log in to my account, but when I contacted customer service, it seemed like they did not want to help me. Great bank, with slight customer service issues!",2014-08-06
753,CapitalOne 360 revolves around you,17309,20928,Capital One,18009,5,I have not been using Capitalone360 for very long but it is very accessible and very easy to use. At this time I only have a checking and a savings account with them but the other products and services that they offer look very attractive. Capitalone 360 seems to offer everything you could ever want or need in financial products without really having to leave your living room. As an incentive to open a checking account they are offering a $50 bonus. The checking account has no fees and it also pays you interest. This is a big plus in my book. I thought that it would be a problem having a checking account with an online only bank but you can access cash at thousands of ATM's with no fee. They even offer mobile deposit so even depositing checks is easy. You can transfer funds from one bank to another and that is very quick. It doesn't get any easier than CapitalOne360. I haven't had to contact customer service but I am quite sure that even that is a piece of cake.,2014-07-31
754,Almost Perfect,17275,20928,Capital One,17975,4,"I signed up with Capitalone360 not long ago on a referral from my sister. So far the service is great.I love their mobile app too. I have a few other bank accounts and they all have some sort of mobile app but none of them are as handy as this one. For the most part I really like my account with them but like almost everything they're not perfect on all front. I have found myself, on more then one occasion, a little displeased with a few aspects of the service. First off, like I said, I haven't been with Capital One long, so believe my surprise when I noticed on two occasions overdraft charges that didn't belong. Once, I understand, but twice, especially in such a short time, was disappointing. Especially since everything was so great otherwise. And it wouldn't have been to bad but when I called the first time the customer service representative I got was rude and not very apologetic about his banks mistake. And the second time, I got a lady who wasn't much nicer. They both fixed the mistake and credited my account but I was definitely unhappy with how they treated me. All in all I still give this bank a good review as everything else has been so good I find myself using this account more then some of the others I have that I've been with for over a decade.",2014-07-23
755,Good Bank,17270,20928,Capital One,17970,5,"I had an Ing account that was taken over by Capital One 360. At first I wasn't sure how well it would work for me, until I looked through all the paperwork. It's so easy to navigate around and I like the rates. I've even got a checking account with them now. Also setting up my kids' savings accounts was just as easy as setting us up with direct deposit. Overall I've found Capital One 360 easy to set up, navigate around and transfer money around. Love this bank!!",2014-07-22
756,Pleasant banking experience,17256,20928,Capital One,17956,4,"I started using Capital One 360 when IngDirect USA merged with Capital One. The strengths about this internet bank include: user friendly website and mobile application, excellent customer service, and low fees when overdrafting account. Some areas where they could improve include: the formatting when exporting transactions into excel, the turnaround time when using the ""Send a Check"" option, and the buggy nature of the mobile app when you try to deposit a check using the camera feature on the phone.",2014-07-18
757,Cap 360 / ING Direct,16787,20928,Capital One,17092,3,"After being pummeled with constant fees from other institutions for years on end, I finally decided to join ING Direct (before they were bought out by Cap One). I was drawn in by the amazing interest rates and the nearly feeless checking accounts. My only real gripe while using the service was that putting money into your account via traditional methods just isn't possible. You'll either need to have some sort of electronic third party, write and take a picture of a check to send to them for verification, or send them a check through good ol' snail mail. <br/> <br/>As of a few months ago, with the dramatic decrease of the saving's account interest rates, I've switched institutions and have left ING / CAP 360 behind. It'd be 5's across the board if Capital One didn't tarnish such an amazing bank.",2014-06-03

They want me to sign and mail it in and while explaining to me the great risk of signing a check and mailing it of that dollar amount and if it gets lost, cashed, etc I am out. So I say no, I will just Echeck deposit it. No there is a limit on that of 5000 per check, so I can't do that either. Then he tells me I have an account linked to mine and maybe just filter it through that account, really, that is my solution? Use a friends account. Then I ask, can I use an ATM, he says sure, but we don't have any in your state or on the West Coast at this time and no plan in place to update the ATMS in my area to accept deposits. <br/>I then ask him, help me out, I have been with ING/CAP a long time, why should I stay, I can't deposit a check, he said I don't know. <br/><br/>WOW is all I could say.. Yes they have treated me fairly, but really is this worth it! I am sure other banks have same issues, but why I can't deposit via ATM is beyond me.<br/><br/>Time for a new bank...",2014-05-14
760,Pretty Good So Far,15883,20928,Capital One,15420,4,"I opened accounts at this bank when it was still ING Direct. At that time, the savings account rate was one of the best....after a while, the interest rate was competitive, but then I used it as a minimal standard. Previously, the bank only allowed 3 ""linked"" accounts via writing and mailing a check or a voided check.<br/><br/>Their CD rates are okay and are affected by the current economy. One of the most interesting things in the past (I don't know about now) is that there was no minimum amount to opening a CD. <br/><br/>When they offered the electric orange checking, it was very very interesting since...it was a new product; no checks; almost a pure billpay account. One nice feature about this account is the P2P (person 2 person) feature that allows a person to sorta link other checking account as outbound destinations; making Cap1-360 a hub. It's a sorta manual method of creating an ACH push, but it's not bad. However, if I knew earlier, I wouldn't waited for the promotion to open an account instead of being an early adpoter.<br/><br/>After the acquisition by Capital One, the rates have stayed competitive, but the main reason I'm ""reviewing"" is because I just noticed the first ""free 50 checks"" for the bill pay account. previously, it was $5 for a pad of checks. nice perk.",2014-01-08

I also really like the possibility of opening sub-savings accounts: this allows you to save for individual things (vacation, house down payment, medical expenses etc) instead of just clumping everything together in ""Savings""<br/><br/>Easy to set up. I did it on my lunch break. No papers, no waiting. Everything online and easy. No need to mail checks. Funding is done by ETF (electronic transfer - not wire transfer so no fee).<br/><br/>Easy to use web site.<br/><br/>Yes I know it takes about 3 days to get money out, but for me the entire point of a savings account is to give myself a time delay to get my money so I don't spend it on silly things.<br/><br/>Got a free $25 bonus just for signing up. In this low interest rate environment, that would have been like 2 years worth of interest. Not a lot, but still free money. I had to sign up through a link generated by someone who already has a Capital One 360 savings account (be referred). Here's a link I generated. If you to go the capital one website through that link you get started with a free $50 for a checking and free $25 for a savings account<br/>https://r.capitalone360.com/Vb1hCPYETk<br/><br/>The only drawback is their mobile app - I don't really like it.

A measely .40% interest isn't worth all the grief they gave me today. <br/><br/>They are holding the funds they transferred from my previous bank for three weeks before they will put it back into my account citing all kinds of reasons for that kind of time as if I was the one that had the script in front of me and should have known all this.

I have been a customer with them for almost 7 years and have not had a poor experience with them. Every time I have had an issue with my accounts or, as of recently, my direct deposits for my new job, the customer service has always been easy to comply with and have gone over and beyond my expectations in helping to fix the problem. I enjoy the rewards program that comes with my debit card, and the prizes come in a wide variety including cash back. The biggest complaint (that I'm sure that many other credit union account holders have) come from the lack of options for banks when there is not a branch around. I lived far away from a DCCU branch for the past 4-5 years, and would have to drive to another credit union approximately 30 minutes away from my residence in order to deposit cash or checks, or avoid outrageous ATM fees. I also applied for a credit card, and feel as if this process goes a lot slower than many other financial institutions. Still, the benefits tend to outweigh these negatives.",2017-09-24
769,Absolutely HORRENDOUS!!!!,29426,795,Delta Community Credit Union,42776,1,"Absolutely horrible!!! I will preface this by saying this was partly my fault. I had opened another checking account, transferred my money into it and left a little money in my other checking to cover coffee costs while I waited for my new debit card in the mail for my new account as I'm not near a branch. Well, I inadvertently went over. However, I caught the error of my mistake and called to explain hoping to resolve the issue only to be told we can't help you by a very rude customer service rep., including a manager. I was charged $585.00!!!!!!!!!!! in overdraft charges within a 3 day period. Was not contacted once about it because I had signed up for ""Courtesy Pay"" which covers you in case of overdraft. What they don't tell you is its $35.00 per transaction. Please explain to me, how the hell that is a Courtesy? Oh sure, we'll allow the $5.00 transaction but we'll bend you over on the overdraft. A ""Courtesy CALL"" would have been much better and would have stopped the bleeding. Was told they would reverse 2 charges but that there was nothing more they are ""able"" to do. These weren't $60-70-80 charges, no, these were $4-5-6 Dunkin Donut charges they were tacking on $35.00 to. <br/><br/>These are the people who are supposed to be looking out for your financial interest. No so.

This is when I decided to look elsewhere, specifically in a credit union. I had heard good things through word-of-mouth about Delta Community Credit Union and decided to sign up. Their personal checking accounts were free, which was the main drawing point. After signing up, I saw there were many other benefits that have never existed at my old bank. The debit card I used offered reward points. Since I didn't have a credit card, earning rewards for purchases was a huge benefit and made me really love banking with Delta. The customer service was another strong point. Dealing with Delta with issues or mistakes on my part was met with sympathy. At my old bank they treated me like the number on my checking account. They rarely worked outside their strict guidelines or accommodated me with anything. At Delta, if I wanted to get free checks, they did that once a year. Overall, Delta showed they cared about me as a customer rather than just the money I deposited into their bank.",2017-08-15

The people went into my account got the money after I cancelled and after I had went to the bank to prevent the withdrawal of the money.

I had a six figure job with perfect credit. Then my wife became disabled and I went three months unemployed. I was rehired by a new company. I asked for a signature loan to allow me to relocate for my new job. The credit union at first approved my loan, based on my credit, but when they found out that I hadn't started my new job yet they disapproved it. They did this despite my new company providing them with my offer letter and all information that the credit union requested. They then changed the criteria and said they needed at least two pay stubs from the new job. In the end, it ended up causing a big inconvenience and significant expense for me. What is the point of having perfect credit, if you can't use it when you need it. I am now employed again and making decent money.

At the time, I was working over 30 miles away from my home, and it was the closest credit union to my job. Although I had credit union relationships elsewhere, Delta Community Credit Union is part of the CUNA (Credit Union National Association) network which allows members (of other credit unions) to utilize their services. This means that anyone who has an account with a CUNA-affiliated credit union, can utilize Delta branches to do deposits, withdrawals, and wire transfers. In addition, they handle balance inquiries. At one point in time, one had to be a Delta Airlines employee in order to setup a Delta Community Credit Union account so, the accommodations that they provide for CUNA members is wonderful. To date, I have received excellent service from the employees at 3 Delta branches all located throughout the Georgia metro region. I am pleased with Delta and highly recommend them.

775,Delta Community Credit Union is awesome!,21695,795,Delta Community Credit Union,24149,4,I have been with Delta Community Credit Union for over three years now and I really love it! They don't charges a whole bunch of fees and even give you one to two times overdraft forgiveness where you don't have to pay a 25 dollar fee for overdrafting your account. You can deposit or withdrawal money with them through the ATMs at each facility. Or you can deposit or withdrawal through their outside drive thru or go inside. They do not charge a monthly fee to bank with them like big companies such as Bank of America or Wells Fargo. The only thing I wish is that they had more ATMS that linked to their Credit Union. They have really good customer service and a nice and friendly staff. They also have nice facilities that are mostly new. I would recommend to many people and have already recommended them to a few of my friends. They also give you 25 bucks for every referral you bring!,2015-07-05
776,Good Credit Union - Terrible Website,21693,795,Delta Community Credit Union,24147,4,"I've been with Delta for over 10 years and have had nothing but good experiences with support and had no issue with savings/checkings. The problems I have encountered were not the fault of Delta, but from some obtuse regulations that make mobile banking frustrating (such as the account transfer limit). I have had issues with my debit card's magnetic strip, but support has always been quick to resolve that.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>The website is a whole other story. They attempted some changes that seem mostly positive, but overall they do not have a serious security mindset when it comes to their website (sadly the case with most online banks). They did not respond at all nor send notification of response to the heartbleed zero day, not even a recommended password reset. The website was ugly and obtuse to use, but recent changes have resolved this somewhat so my rating for web/mobile experience is 2 stars instead of 1. General navigation used to be bad, but has improved. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>The fees are fairly standard and does include the unpopular ""courtesy pay"" fees, which can become quite expensive. Interest rates for savings accounts are low and disappointing, but nothing that that is abnormal to other credit unions and banks. I have been hit with the ugly $35 courtesy pay fee. Sadly, these overdraw fees are described as a ""feature"" that you can't opt out of, but you can opt out of the courtesy pay plus.",2015-07-04

The last straw just happened - their bill pay system did not pay a credit card (the system shows a date and an amount, but nothing was processed AND they did not notify us) - I found out when my delinquent credit card statement showed up. I called their online/bill pay 800# only to be told that they couldn't access my account without a SSN - when I inquired why they couldn't just use our account number the operator said they were an outsourced call center. I finally had to call the general 800# and was switched to 4 different people just to find out what happened (the last person was going to call me back because their ""IT people were in a meeting"").  <br/><br/> We're done.

At TD Ameritrade - with no expedition fees - the distribution arrives in a few days. Same with Scottrade and Vanguard. They also answer phone calls within a few minutes; TD Ameritrade. immediately. The inconveniences with this bank are too great to continue to deal with. So, I am closing 4 accounts at Ally after only 6 months with them.",2019-10-21

797,Order For Checks - Horrible Experience,39242,277,Ally Bank,856,1,"Here's a chronology when I ordered checks for my existing checking account:<br/><br/>9/13 - Logged on and placed Order #1 for more checks---supposed to receive in 2 weeks from order date per Ally info.<br/><br/>9/30 - More than 2 weeks later and no checks received on Order #1. Called Ally and spoke to ""Melissa"". She said Order #1 had shipped 9/20...but I still had not received by 9/30. She offered to place Order #2 for a box of 100 checks instead of the usual 20. I agreed and she did this....or so I thought.<br/><br/>10/4 - Order #1 still not received. I called Ally and spoke to ""Brandon"" who said I should have received Order #1 by 9/27 (2 weeks from 9/13). I was concerned that someone else had received these checks and could use them, so I asked him to stop payment on those check numbers 1021 to 1040. Scary Note - He almost accidently stopped payment on the checks I already had received when I initially opened the account more than a year ago!....but he did correct this....I hope. <br/><br/>10/10 - Order #1 received---4 weeks after order placed online 9/13!! These checks useless now since I had stop payment placed on 10/4. Brandon did say on 10/4 that I could call and remove stop payment, but in my mind, what if they don't do this right and I bounce checks!? I think I will be receiving a box of 100 that Melissa ordered on 9/30 as Order #2, so I'm willing to let the stop payment stay on Order #1 checks.<br/><br/>10/11 - Order #2 received ---what the___? Only 20 checks received....not the box of 100 Melissa supposedly ordered!!? <br/><br/>Ally, Don't bother offering checking accounts if you can't handle simple check orders!! What a mess.....and I end up with 20 checks after all this hassle for a month. And also, no acknowledgement record when I log on or by email that I even placed these orders....only by calling in....but this is supposed to be an online bank!!? What a farce!",2019-10-15

Simple request and it wasn't done...<br/><br/>I think I will pull all my CDs out when they expire and move to another bank since this is the second time they created an issue.

Six months ago I received through TXT message that my e-mail address was ""updated"", Also another message show that my passcode also was ""updated"". When I check my account, effectively, my profile was changed internally with another email and passcode. Ally did not have explanations for the event, rather indicate that the account has been compromise and for ""my security"" the account should be close rather that just correct the Anonymous updates. Six month later when I try to log-on into the account, the page reloads itself. After unsuccessful tries, I call them to know the status of the account. They ask the usual questions, then the request to hold up to verify the account 2-3 minutes, those minutes extended to 54 minutes of verifying, they started to ask about: Which state my parents got my Social Security, which is my height, where I am now, which id my ISP and which is my driver license number, I did complain since in no place those questions were made.

I am currently sitting on hold and it has been 20 minutes; the recording keeps saying a representative will be with me in 10-15 minutes more. Twice in the last month I have requested withdrawals. One took six weeks for them to get it right. The other one took a month and 4 phone calls (sitting on extended hold each time.) Not to mention each time I spoke with a representative I was given different information. I am currently working on another transfer and it's going on three weeks and still no transfer. They also have an issue with their beneficiary page on the website. It doesn't save the information right away. Once a change is made on the beneficiary page each time the page is subsequently opened, the system arbitrarily changes the beneficiaries.

804,Very Happy Long-Term - NOT,38096,277,Ally Bank,60832,1,"ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>I've been an Ally Customer for years - via acquisition - and then became a ""double customer"" when they acquired my brokerage. For basically-free, interest-earning checking and savings account, they are the best I have found. Rarely have I needed customer service, but when I did, it was good.<br/><br/>I'm not saying they're perfect. Their website and (especially) their app have bugs and aren't nearly as easy to use as they should be. When I've reported the bugs, they've politely blown me off. Also, the brokerage's clearing firm, Apex, makes mistakes when reporting your taxable activity to to government. I mean, taxes are complicated, but not THAT complicated that their accounting bugs cannot be fixed over a period of years. I've never understood why they can't get it right.<br/><br/>2019-08-22 UPDATE:<br/>When I needed to withdraw funds to buy a house, Ally let me down so badly that I'm closing all accounts. I started trying to wire the money to the title company on Monday morning. Ally Invest won't allow ""third party transfers"", so I had to wire it to my Ally Bank account. It took fully two days to achieve that step. And from when I requested the wire from Ally Bank to the title company, it took well over 24 hours, even though I had told them of my closing time and asked for anything they could do to help me meet it. They didn't even call to verify the wire until 24 hours after my request. I looked like an idiot at the Thursday closing, because the funds weren't there. I was really embarrassed and am now looking for a new bank.",2019-07-16

806,Trustworthy And One Of The Best Online Banks For Me,37987,277,Ally Bank,52410,4,"I’ve been with Ally bank since October, 2019. So far, I am really impressed with how they function and their services. Large ACH transfer limits ($250K per day, maybe more - check their disclosures), options for multiple beneficiaries and trust accounts are probably the best from available on-line banks and CUs. I started with their Savings Account special, but decided to give their CDs a try. While they are not the leader in rates and have dropped their rates on all products over the last several months (similar to the majority of other on-line banks and CUs), their customer service and easy on-line account management really stands out compared to just about all other on-line banks and institutions. For me, top rates are as important as making sure I can trust a financial institution and feel comfortable with their processes. What good is a top rate on a product, if you cannot have easy access to your money or cannot rely on getting your funds out. One of their best options is the ability to easily open and manage your CDs on-line, including changing the CD Maturity instructions. It literally takes one click and you are done – no silly e-mail messages or snail mail instructions. They actually send you an e-mail letting you know 1 year in advance (of the CD maturity) when you are able to change the maturity instructions. I also recently had a direct experience with their customer service when they dropped a rate on a CD I opened within several days (of opening the CD). Before transferring the money into CD, I called them and a CSR told me that my rate will stay as advertised (when I opened the CD). However, after I transferred the funds before the weekend, next Monday the rate on my CD dropped (they have dropped the rates for all of their products during that week). I called Customer Service and spoke with a supervisor, explaining the situation and requesting an originally advertised rate. After several days, they honored the original rate automatically in my on-line account and followed-up with a call (actually called me several times) and an updated mailed CD Certificate. The next test/experience will be when one of my CD matures – which is about 10 months from now. I am giving them 4 stars for not being a rate leader and a slip-up on the first CSR incorrect verification.",2019-07-09

I notified them in advance of the maturity date and that I wanted a check for the entire amount sent to my home address. They said it would be 3 days to issue the check and then 7 to 10 business days to receive the check. I waited three weeks and then began calling them. They said the check must be lost and they had to send a form to me to fill out saying it was lost and it had to be notarized. They said they would send the form three times and I never got it. I am loosing about $8 per day that I don't have my money and I suspect they are making the interest for themselves on my money. I still don't have it a month later. Very upset with them.

Maybe they should consider that a 5 business day hold makes a person more likely to overdraft their account. But more likely, they're just looking for more ways to make easy money off of individuals who are struggling financially and are easy targets.

She fall into fraud/scam job which she reported to ftc.gov and then told it to Ally bank about everything ally customer service asked her to close the account as scam job folks knew her account number. Before closing she should have zero balance so she transferred money into my account. ally customer service asked her to open a new account. Which she did.

As the bank's automated announcement requested at the beginning of my call, at the end of my conversation, I waited in order to be connected to the survey, but nothing came up. <br/><br/>Third, lack of efficient communication! They contacted me to remove my credit frees, without providing exact info or direction about what they exactly want. So I did remove the frees for one time use; then when I called to give them the pin number for accessing my credit report, they informed me that they couldn’t use the pin for one time access, so I had to put the time to redo the process again for 24 hour frees lift. <br/><br/>When I ask to talk to a manager to communicate my concern about giving my SS# to so many people, I was put on hold for 16 minutes. I finally disconnected the phone and called the general customer service, no one was available there either. The clerk said that a manager would contact me in the next 48 hours. Absolutely incredible!",2018-10-15
828,Stole My Money In The Name Of Security!!!,35090,277,Ally Bank,53237,1,"I got a check from my account I closed with keybank, and I deposited it with Ally mobile banking on 1st of August, 2018, they closed the account on 2nd of August, 2018, when I asked why, they claimed the reason is ""fraud""! Then I asked whoever spoke to me then if my check is still okay since you closed the account, so I can find a better and suitable bank, but she coudln't give reasonable response, so I went ahead and deposited the check with Alliant CU, and when Alliant couldn't clear it, I had to call Keybank what happened, and they said they already paid the check out to Ally bank same week I deposited with them. I've been calling them since then, and they've been dribbling me back and forth, asking me to tell keybank to contact them, and Key made it clear that they have nothing to do with it anymore, check has been paid out! I don't understand why you closed an account for alleged fraud, but you held unto the money for almost 2 months now, even murder case get solved in less time frame. Unless they never intend to give me back my money. I've requested evidence from keybank on how and when they paid Ally the check, I'm hoping there is something I can do with that to claim back my money when it hit my mail. I'm not about to let some cooperate thieves steal $4,600 from me, I'm on wheelchair for christ sake!. I'm gonna keep posting this in as many review platform that I can.",2018-09-21
829,Overdue For A Rate Increase,34983,277,Ally Bank,53032,3,"With CIT now at a stunning 2.45%, Ally needs to step up. MANY options now pay more than Ally. I'm a 10 year customer, but I'm getting discouraged.",2018-09-10
830,Easily Supports Trust Accounts,34917,277,Ally Bank,40752,5,"Needing to open up an account in addition to my bank and credit union accounts, I considered the major online providers. Most don't support trust accounts. The few that do seemed to make it a somewhat difficult experience. Ally Bank was different. Even though their rate at the time was 5 or 10 basic points lower than some of the other stable online banks, I found their explanation of the process of opening up a trust account to be clear and reasonable. So I did, and I have to say it was the easiest account-opening process I have ever experienced with a financial institution. <br/>Everything proceeded exactly as promised. Ally may not have THE highest rates but I think they're close to the top, and I give them huge kudos for supporting trust accounts. If you have enough money to be considering an online bank, you probably need to consider having a living trust, and Ally is one of the few banks that seems to acknowledge that need.<br/><br/>Online transfers are easy and relatively quick...not as quick as with my credit union account, but the money is there once the clock strikes midnight in the Eastern time zone (there must be some batch process involved). The set-up process for online transfers was the easiest I've ever dealt with. Not only do they make the usual trial deposits, they back them out at the same time rather than waiting a few days, thus minimizing disruption to your other accounts.<br/><br/>I haven't done much with the mobile app yet, and I haven't tried remote deposit capture.<br/><br/>I've had my account for a month, and I hope Ally continues with its great track record to this point. I think there's a reason so many DA reviews of Ally are so positive.",2018-09-01

833,The Gold Standard (Yes Still But Updated),34509,277,Ally Bank,43773,4,"tl;dr Ally has been my gold standard for online banking.<br/><br/>Rates:<br/>Ally does not seem to want to be a rate leader any longer. Their rates are good, mind you, but they have not been the leader for a while. They've remained near the top so they're dependable. When rates go up, you get them without any work like it should be. If you don't feel like opening multiple accounts and transferring money all over the place, you'll find a comfy home here. However, I feel they're hurting their less wealthy clients with their account tiers but they are clearly stated at least.<br/><br/>Web Software:<br/>They have the best, which isn't to say it could be less ""fancy"" and thus better, but their self service is second to none. I can manage my CDs, open new accounts, transfer funds, set up anything in under a minute. No other bank's software comes close.<br/><br/>Customer Service:<br/>I'm almost complete self service so I don't need them. In the past I can recall having good service but it has changed vastly since. I hope it varies based on the day, who you get, their mood, the moon(?), etc. but recently their representative have taken weeks to respond with insufficient answers.",2018-07-20

835,A Great Experience,34160,277,Ally Bank,51319,5,"I have had Ally checking and savings for a year or so. The only hiccup was identity verification, but a phone call resolved that in a matter of a few hours, and my account was activated. The interest checking has no fees, and a nice simple interface online. Billpay has not had any problems, but just make sure the phone numbers on the prefilled forms are correct. The biggest reason for choosing Ally are their card controls. Lots of people groan about it being a separate app, but seeing how many cards get hacked, it's well worth it. I can feel safe setting my limits when I don't want to use the debit card. I would like to see their card controls added to the desktop version of online banking though, so I can have an interface either on my phone or on my computer. I did order some checks and they came free as advertised in about a week. The savings account is no frills, but has outstanding rates. Ally's management are continuing to raise the rates while the brick and mortars sit at .01 percent for what seems like forever. Good job Ally!",2018-06-14
836,Difficult To Withdraw Money!,34106,277,Ally Bank,51183,1,"Everything from creating the account to depositing money and the UX of the site is great.<br/><br/>The only problem is you can't (easily) withdraw your money.<br/><br/>I have been trying to close my no-penalty CDs and sent them a secure message. No response.<br/><br/>I called them - after verifying everything the agent made me wait 5-7 minutes and then said - ""sorry looks like system is going through an update..."" They said call again and a different group that is not going through a ""system update"" will be able to help.<br/><br/>I call again - again verified everything - made me wait - and behold ""system is going through an update.""<br/><br/>Can't be coincidence that the system ""suddenly goes through an update"" when a customer wants to withdraw the money.<br/><br/>Administrative barriers to make withdrawals difficult.

837,Online Banking is So Convenient!,34055,277,Ally Bank,51069,5,"Honestly I've had a fantastic experience with Ally. Whenever I've needed assistance, their customer support line is always open and available. I've called with minor questions before and the customer support I spoke with were helpful and very friendly too. When I've done transfers to and from this account, I've never had an issue with them. Usually if you do a transfer on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday you won't see it hit the account until Monday but that's perfectly predictable. Debits come out instantly and the only time I overdrew was my own stupid mistake and even then they didn't charge me a fee since it happened in one transaction. That was a huge comfort, let me tell you. All in all if you don't need to deposit cash, an online bank is the way to go in my opinion, particularly if you do a lot of online business.",2018-06-01
838,Pleased,33784,277,Ally Bank,50582,4,"Overall had a great experience with them. I had a CD with them, along with a savings/checking account that I used to fund the CD's. I was concerned that since it was an internet only bank that if I had issues they would be hard to solve, l was wrong and their customer support was excellent for when I had questions about setting up my accounts. I had a long tern CD, 2 year term and I had a short term one, 6 months. Overall I was overly pleased with how smooth everything went with the company, and although I am currently not using them anymore, I will be looking to open up another long term CD and I will mostly likely also be rolling over an IRA to them as well.",2018-05-17

840,Pretty Much Wonderful,33773,277,Ally Bank,50571,4,"My experience with Ally bank has been pretty much wonderful. <br/> <br/>For example, in regards to their customer service, I've had to contact them a few times over the past few years about disputing transactions (none of which were their fault). Everytime I've had to call them, they've had someone fluent in English there to support me. Furthermore, the calls were quick and easy, with no wait time. On the one occasion I used their website chat feature, they were equally quick and fluent in English. Their website is modern and simple, as is their mobile app. Everything is laid out clearly and there's no fluff. They pay most of my ATM fees for me. <br/> <br/>If I did have to complain about something, it would be the lack of support for depositing cash. Withdrawing is fine, but they have no support whatsoever for depositing pure cash. Not a big deal for me, as I use the Internet for pretty much everything and my income is deposited directly in my account.",2018-05-15
841,Excellent bank,33753,277,Ally Bank,50551,5,"I've been a customer of Ally since 2011 and I have found them to be stellar in every regard. It's actually quite difficult to be charged fees, especially if you maintain your accounts diligently like I do. What I like about Ally is that they have US based customer service and it's easy to reach them via chat.. They are always constantly improving their online banking website and their smartphone apps - in fact, their most recent updates have made it super easy for me to track account balances. In cases where I have had issues with the bank itself, their customer service will make it right. However, my one negative with Ally is that their bill pay system can be frustrating to use as sometimes bill pay paper checks take a while to be mailed (especially official checks) and setting up eBills can be a bit of a pain as sometimes it gets caught between the biller's system and Ally's system.",2018-05-14
842,Best Decisions,33735,277,Ally Bank,50533,5,"Ally Bank has become one of best decisions that I have made. I needed an online bank that would fit my various needs. I wanted to have a debit card that would allow me to access my funds as any needs came up. I also wanted to be able to deposit checks online (with Ally I take a picture of the front and the back of the check). What makes Ally so good is that it is all electronic - I even have a checking account that earns interest - no hidden fees or annual fees, plus I don't have to keep a certain balance. I even have the ability to take out cash in a pinch too. Though, I have not used some of Ally Bank's other offerings, it is nice to know there are savigns accounts and even mutAul fund accounts too. One other option that I have used is their check writing option. I recently went to join Planet Fitness and they required a checking account. -so even in this situation I was covered.",2018-05-11

Their rates are the best I can find, much better than retail bank establishments. When I opened my savings account they offered a rate of 1% APY, while other banks were offering .05%. They raise their savings rates to align more or less with how the FED raises rates, most retail banks don't do that. As of 04/18, the rate on my savings account is 1.45%. I can't really comment on their customer service, since I've never had to contact customer service, but as a customer of 5+ years, that is a testament unto itself.",2018-05-08

The checking account is interest bearing and while that alone is not going to grow your money significantly, it is a nice feature. The savings account interest rates are some of the highest in the US right now. The customer service is outstanding. I have had multiple attempts to fraudulently use my card and each time Ally is right on top of it. Customer service called me out of the blue one morning to make sure I wasn't trying to use my debit card in China right then. When it became apparent that the attempted charges were fraudulent, the CS rep declined the transaction and went over all of the recent purchase history for that card making sure I recognized all the charges. There was on other recent charge that wasn't me and it was immediately wiped off and the account was suspended while they issued me a new card. It was handled in the most professional way possible and I hung up the phone feeling incredibly satisfied. <br/>The mobile app and website for Ally make doing really anything banking related a snap. Checks up to $50,000 can be deposited from your smartphone. How cool is that? <br/>All in all, I can't imagine a scenario where I would go back to banking with a brick and mortar institution.

I also received a supply of checks.

I was very nervous at first because they are not a brick and mortar bank. I do all of my banking through their app or website. We have checking and savings accounts with them. When i opened 2 savings accounts for my kids I was able to do it all online. When i had a question what the requirements for a custodial accounts were the online representative was very helpful. They answered my questions of if both parents could be on the account or just one had to be. The wait time was under 3 minutes when I called to ask my questions. They then sent me the paperwork that needed to be signed and returned to them. Their bank rates for checking and savings is far best around. The local banks could not hold a candle to the 1.25 percent interest rate Ally was offering. And you did not have to have a high balance to earn that rate. It's very easy to make deposits into the accounts as well. I can either deposit checks with my phone or I can send them in the mail. I prefer though their app. I just take a picture of the check and type in the required information and it gets deposited. I have never had a problems with deposits not going through. I get a statement in the mail every quarter from them and it's easy to read. It's very easy to transfer money between accounts. It's labeled from and then to. Money gets transferred in a timely matter.,2018-04-29

Fees charged by the bank or the ATM owner are reimbursed by Ally Bank. I also can order free checks from Ally as often as I would like. I can and have opened multiple savings accounts and give each of them a separate name. This is very useful for creating ""Buckets."" I can transfer money to/from Ally for free, with a few days time.

The savings/checking account interest rates have been better than most places throughout that time. During this time we have not had any issues with fraudulent charges or any other issues with our account. The only issue we have had is cashing checks for my wife's business into the account. As the checks are not payable to her name, but to her business instead, Ally will not accept the funds, which is understandable.<br/> <br/>We have also had issues with depositing cash into the account. We sold a car for cash, and were unable to deposit all the cash into the account at once. We have since opened an account with a local bank for such instances.<br/> <br/>I use the checking deposit scanner on my phone several times a month. About a year ago the application updated to automatically take a picture of the check when it is in focus and that has worked extremely well.",2018-04-27

Setting up the account was straight forward and didn't take much time to set up (maybe 15 minutes). I then set up an automatic withdrawal from my regular bank account from my local bank branch. This was also quick to set up, but took a day to finalize in order for them to make the random deposits that I needed to verify. Since then the deposits have been made automatically with perfect reliability. Twice since I opened the account with Ally they have increased the interest rates without my asking. I have had zero problems with my Ally account.

It offers the convenience of mobile check deposit and then you can use any ATM to withdraw cash when you need it! We have rarely had a need to contact customer service since you can do almost everything from the website, but when needed we got quick, helpful responses from the online chat feature. We have moved several times and we could keep our bank since Ally is internet-based.

Customer service is great, too - there is always someone readily available by phone, or you can email, if you prefer. The website and app are both really easy to use (love that photo deposit feature!), and designed so that you can see your ""total value"" of all accounts, like savings, checking, and CDs, and then also breaks down that information for individual accounts.

They have been awesome. I like that they pay their customers interest each month depending on how much is kept in their savings account. Recently they have started next business day bank transfers where I can make transfers to any of my connected bank accounts within one business day for free. This has been heaven sent for me for times where I needed a quick transaction or needed to try to avoid overdraft fees in any of my other bank accounts. I have not had to have much contact with customer service, but the times I did need to reach out, they were very helpful in helping me find the forms I needed to make necessary changes. Dealing with them has been one of the easiest banking experiences and I wish other larger banks would follow suit. I can make up to 6 transactions each month before I am charged $10 per transaction which is fair and still a low amount to charge for a banking transaction.

We decided to go with Ally Bank for a few reasons. First, there interest rate was a bit higher than other places. They had a savings account with a daily compound interest rate of 1.45%. The mobile app is wonderful and has worked perfect every time. I read some reviews of online institutions having terrible costumer service and difficulty with the mobile app working but this is not the case with Ally. Another reason we chose Ally bank is the ability of transferring funds between this savings account and other accounts that are not with Ally. Our transfers have not taken longer than 2 days. All and all, we do enjoy banking with Ally online and plan on opening a few more accounts in the near future.",2018-04-16
861,Ally Bank is a solid online banking option,32832,277,Ally Bank,49793,4,"I started using Ally Bank because my friends and family recommended the bank to me. They had mentioned the higher interest rates and the great customer service. Sign-up was swift and easy -- it took only a few minutes to create a savings account. My expectations were certainly met. Their customer service is always accessible and the interest rate is competitive. There are no additional fees, which many other institutions impose. Recently, I needed a cashier's check. I called Ally and they sent one to me within several days free of cost. The mobile app is also solidly-built for both iOS and Android. I would highly recommend Ally Bank for anyone looking for a checking account and/or savings account. If my primary checking account with Chase weren't so convenient in my area, then I would have no problem using Ally Bank solely for my banking purposes.

I decided to take a chance as they had a lot of positive reviews and I knew that if the experience was poor, I could always just remove my funds. Thankfully, my experience with them has always been amazing. I would even say its been much better than some of the banks that have brick and mortar locations. They are extremely quick to respond to inquiries and you also have the option of removing funds from an ATM if needed. All communication is prompt and helpful. I will continue to use them in the future. I will admit, it does take a little getting used to only doing your business online, but after the initial learning curve, it is well worth the exemplary customer service.",2018-04-13

The account was simple to set up in a matter of minutes. Although I don't take advantage of their other products, I can tell you the customer service for the free online checking was superb. I called to have some checks sent out and to ask about interest rates and the representative that I spoke to was both friendly and knowledgeable. I can't say enough about how good this online bank is, have I mentioned that the account is entirely free with no hidden fees? Seriously, I have had this account for 6 months now and use it daily for deposits and withdraws with my debit card. This online bank is highly recommended. The only wish I had for the account might be a higher interest rate on the checking account but again the account is free after all.",2018-04-11
864,Ally Bank,32701,277,Ally Bank,49484,4,I recently opened a high yield online savings account with Ally Bank. I had been looking for a savings account which paid a (relatively speaking for today) high interest rate. Ally had one of the highest I found. Customer service was very helpful setting up the account. I access my account online and through their mobile app. The mobile app makes it very convenient to deposit money into my account. I would highly recommend Ally to anyone looking for an online bank account.,2018-04-10
865,Ally Checking,32680,277,Ally Bank,49463,5,"I opened an Ally checking account so I could put money away fro emergencies. I wanted a bank account that would be outside of my normal bank, so it would be 'out of sight, out of mind'. It only took a few minutes of work to apply for the account, and about a day to get all the verification and whatnot completed. It took a few minutes to set up an automatic withdrawal from my main checking account. The app is intuitive and gives me the info I want quick. Shortly after setting up the account, I received a notification that my interest rate increased, which was nice.",2018-04-08
866,Great Experience,32678,277,Ally Bank,49461,4,"I was leary about using an online bank. I wondered if my information would be secure and it seemed strange to bank with a company where I couldn't walk into a branch and talk to someone. I took a chance on Ally bank because I wanted a place to save money where my husband couldn't get to it. So, I signed up for a money market account. I am so glad I did! Their interest rates are better than anything else I found offered. The website is easy to use and understand and it walks you through each step of depositing money. With their money market accounts, you can spend the money as often as you want without being penalized and the account comes with a debit card which is convenient and gave me peace of mind. The money is readily available to me if I have an emergency and need to use it. Overall, I have been very happy with the service and I'm glad I opened the account. I plan to stay with Ally for a long time to come!",2018-04-07
867,Best Interest Rates,32669,277,Ally Bank,49452,5,"I have been banking with Ally Bank for approximately 5 years. I have both savings accounts and a checking account with them. Ally Bank has always had some of the best interest rates on deposits in the industry and they are currently offering 1.45% on their savings account. One thing that I really like about Ally is the ability to open multiple savings accounts with them. I currently have 6 savings accounts and one checking account. This is useful because I can name these accounts and earmark these funds for various goals in my life. The checking account is another very nice offering from Ally. This account comes with free checks, all you have to do is order online and they deliver to you free of charge. The checking account also comes with a debit card. The great thing about this debit card is the fee to use and ATM. Ally Bank does not own or maintain their own ATM machines. However, you can use the card at any ATM machine. Ally Bank will reimburse any fees charged by the owner of the ATM up to a certain amount per month. This is a huge savings in an industry that typically nickel and dimes you to death.",2018-04-06
868,Very competitive rates on savings!,32648,277,Ally Bank,49431,4,"I started an online savings account with this bank after shopping around a bit because I wasn't happy with the interest rates that my regular bank (used for checking and savings) was offering-- their interest rates are less than 1%. I found this after searching and was satisfied that they are FDIC insured and their interest rates (when I opened the account) were at 1.25% no matter what amount the customer had in the account. The sign up process was very easy, and I started the account with just $50, because I had concerns that it was an online only bank. In the six months since I opened the account, the interest rate has gone up twice; the first time to 1.35%, and now currently it is at 1.45%. I have deposited more into the account as I have become more comfortable with the idea of an online only bank. I have not had to contact customer service so far, as I have had no issues. Statements are timely and I receive an email each time a statement is released. Any time I request a transfer of funds, I also receive an email notifying me of the transfer (when it scheduled, when it should be transferred, and when the transfer is complete). The mobile application is also easy to use to check on the account. Because it is a savings-only account, I am limited to how many transactions I can make each month from the account (but there are unlimited transfers to the account). I find that it is well worth it to have CD rates but without the obligation to have my money locked into an account for a specified time period.",2018-04-04
869,Ally Bank is great!,32645,277,Ally Bank,49428,4,"Ally Bank is an amazing online bank that I've been banking with for a few years now. With regards to their deposit accounts, I currently have a checking and savings account through Ally. I have had nothing but good experiences with this bank. I find their online deposit accounts are very easy to use. The website and mobile apps are very user friendly and easy to navigate. I had a question related to my checking account one day and called the bank and was given very quick advice from their customer support representative. The person I spoke to was very polite and willing to help me out. I think customer service goes a long way when it comes to customer satisfaction. I have highly recommended this bank to my family and friends and will continue to share the great experiences I have had with them.",2018-04-04
870,Ally Bank has my vote!,32579,277,Ally Bank,49294,5,"As someone who has become disillusioned by my regular brick and mortar bank, I decided to open my new savings account with Ally Bank. I have had nothing but a great experience with them! When I initiate a transfer from my checking account to my savings, they tell me exactly when the money will be taken out of my checking and when it will be deposited in my savings account. I am aware how many withdrawals I am allowed to make from my savings per month and how long it would take to transfer money back to my checking account. I love that the banking is done completely online and NOT linked to my checking account for quick withdrawal, as this usually means less saving on my part. Overall, I would give this bank five stars!",2018-03-30
871,Highly recommend Ally's Online Savings account,32571,277,Ally Bank,49286,4,"I've had an online savings account with Ally for a little over 5 years now. Their website is easy to use and I've never experienced an outage when I wanted to do something. Transfers used to take 3 business days to process, but now they typically take one (as long as you submit the transfer request early enough in the day!) Rates are generally competitive - however, they do tend to take longer to raise their rate compared to other online banks. Even if other banks pay slightly higher rates, I'm happy and have no plans to move my money elsewhere. I've also been confident enough with Ally to refer their online savings account to family members, and they have been equally as happy with their accounts.",2018-03-29
872,Great Savings Rate,32458,277,Ally Bank,49079,5,"Pretty much all banks are the same if they are backed by FDIC, but what makes this bank stand out above all others is that they have the highest savings interest rate that I could find. When other banks were only offering about 0.5% this bank had a 1% interest rate for savings accounts. Currently their interest rate just went up from 1.35 to 1.45%. I have a few different savings accounts and with about the same amount I was getting pennies in my other account, but with this bank I was getting dollars in interest. Also the wait time to get a hold of someone from customer service is always available. The longest that I have seen the wait time was 10 minutes. Typically it is a 1 or 2 minute wait. I think what helps them to be able to offer these services is the fact that they don't have any physical branches around the country so their overhead costs are much lower than the traditional banks.",2018-03-21
873,My online banking experience,32455,277,Ally Bank,49076,5,"I have been using Ally Bank for over a year. I chose Ally bank because a friend of mine told me about the bank. At the time I was looking for a bank to handle my commission payments so I would not commingle my monies with my family money. I wanted a bank that I can easily view from my mobile platform and a way to get to cash that would be very easy than a traditional bank. I looked at a few different on-line banks however I felt that Ally met me needs. Their customer service is also very good. They answer all of my questions and they are always available. Since I am self employed they have various products that I am interested in such as a SEP IRA and they also have a way to make investments. Another benefit that they have is the ability to pay bills seamlessly on line. I can manage my accounts, pay bills, set up payment options and send money to my wife or to my family account very easily. I have been very happy with Ally and I would recommend them to my friends and family.",2018-03-21
874,Ally bank,32445,277,Ally Bank,49066,3,"So I bank with Ally and hold a savings account as well as a checking account. I like that they offer no fees. Places like Chase gouge me with fees and I decided it was time to change who I bank with. I also like that they have high interest rates. If I am keeping my money in a bank I expect competitive interest rates which again the major banking corporations were not giving me. I appreciate that although ally does not have a physical location they were able to offer me good customer support via phone and online. It would be nice to be able to go to a physical Location to drop off checks, speak to a real person, or to withdraw money, but I was willing to give all of that up for ally. I feel that when I bank with Ally they aren't trying to Scam me or rip me off but that they actually want their customers to be happy. This is why I bank with ally and I have absolutely no regrets. I would recommend ally wholeheartedly with no reservations whatsoever.",2018-03-20
875,Highly Recommend Ally Bank,32396,277,Ally Bank,48920,5,"My wife and I use Ally's online savings account for our emergency fund because of their competitive interest rates (currently at 1.45% APY and no fees, which we love). It was easy to sign up and create an account. I did hit a snag along the way regarding our mailing address, which brought me into contact with Ally's customer service for the first time. As far as quality goes, it was outstanding. Every representative I talked to was polite, professional, and helpful. However, the wait time to speak with a real person was sometimes long (10-20 minutes), so I'd rate their customer service 4/5. Another thing we love is Ally's commitment to a useable app and web site -- both are sleek and easy to use. Overall, I highly recommend them for an online-only bank.",2018-03-17
876,No Problems,32383,277,Ally Bank,48907,4,"I have had an checking account at Ally for about a year now, and have had no problems. The web interface is very straight-forward and user friendly. I like the layout- there is no need to search for things like in some banks. One specific thing is the account/routing numbers. On most websites, you really have to search for these, and sometimes go somewhere else to look up routing numbers. On Ally, the account number and routing number are right at the top of the page- the account number is hidden, but can easily be revealed. I like this feature because it makes it easier to link this to other accounts. Most of the other features (transactions, debit card stuff, etc) are pretty standard. One other thing that sticks out is support- info is right at the top of the page. Again, most banks, you really have to search for this. Another feature is Ally's mobile app. Everything you need is at your finger tips, when you need it.",2018-03-16
877,GOOD EXPERIENCE,32375,277,Ally Bank,48899,5,I opened an Ally Bank online account about 4 years ago. It's very easy to open and keep track of your finances all online. You can easily deposit money or transfer money into your account. I only transferred money from an existing account at another bank. Transfers either way usually took about 1-2 days to complete.,2018-03-16
878,Never had a problem.,32290,277,Ally Bank,48729,4,"I have banked with Ally Bank for over five years now, and have not had a problem with them yet. They do not charge any fees for basic checking and savings, and they pay a decent interest rate. They even show how much interest you earned for every month right at the top of your account page. The website is easy to use, and you can manage your account, and handle transactions right from there. The mobile app is very useful as well, and you can easily do the same things from the app as you can with the website. The customer service is very good as well. You can contact them on the internet or by phone. I have only had to contact the customer service one time by phone, and when I did I was happy with the excellent customer service. They actually took care of my problem in a matter of minutes. Overall, I am very happy with Ally Bank, and have no plans of changing banks anytime soon.",2018-03-11
879,Why I like my Ally savings account,32187,277,Ally Bank,48536,4,"I've been a member of Ally Bank for almost two years. I started with a couple hundred dollars just to see and test the waters. I am a happy camper! I've gradually added more money and think of it almost as a retirement account. The savings account interest rate is beyond what I would have thought. It has gone up at least three times since I've been a member. I get timely emails on offers, news about interest rates and other products that they have and have nothing put good interaction. While I have never had to speak to a customer service representative, I can't imagine their customer service would be too bad. I haven't used their mobile app, but they did have a promotion during Super Bowl that almost made me download it. Their website has always been up and running fast when I've logged in. Rates and balances are always posted on time. I would definitely recommend this bank.",2018-03-10
880,Overall great experience,32180,277,Ally Bank,48529,4,We like using Ally for our savings account. They have a slightly higher interest rate than brick and mortar banks and their option to chat online with customer service reps or call is great. I've never had to wait more than a minute to talk with anyone. We used to have a checking account with them and I liked it a lot except for one crucial detail and that was that it was a pain in the butt to cash/deposit checks written from another country. You can't deposit checks written from Canada for instance via their app so we decided to go with a local bank for our checking account and keep the savings account with Ally.,2018-03-09
881,Savings Account is Awesome!,32114,277,Ally Bank,48400,4,"I signed up for their savings account in July of 2017, and the APY has jumped from 1.20 to 1.45%! You guys, that's free money! It helps me feel better about my savings goals, and I'm actually excited to deposit into my account now. If you need to transfer money from your savings to a non-Ally bank account, it does take a few days, which is nice in a way because it helps me stay more disciplined about saving.<br/>Why I didn't give them a perfect rating:My fiance and I recently tried to open a joint checking account with them, but got denied because my credit score sucks, and he doesn't have a credit score. It would have been nice to know that was going to be a big deal.",2018-03-08
882,Ally is an excellent option for online banking,32092,277,Ally Bank,48377,4,"The Ally mobile app and website make it possible to do all your day-to-day banking remotely, including depositing checks. I used to have Chase, but I moved to a location with no Chase branches, and I planned to get a new in-person bank. But I've found that I don't need to visit a branch to do any of the things I need because the Ally app and website are so comprehensive. My housemate and I can pay each other for bills and groceries with no problem on the website, which is very helpful.",2018-03-06
883,Ally Bank is Great,32073,277,Ally Bank,48350,5,"Ally Bank is great! I started off by opening a savings account and was blown away by their interest rates. After that first account, I opened a second savings account followed by a Roth IRA and a CD all through Ally Bank. I have been incredibly pleased with their easy to use website and their very high interest rates on all the accounts I hold there. I have only once had to have contact with one of the representatives on Ally bank's website and they were very helpful, friendly, and accurately resolved my issue. I have automatic deposits set up and their options are very easy. They offer weekly, bi-weekly, monthly and more options to electronically deposit money into your savings accounts. I would recommend Ally bank to anyone who likes to watch their account grow.",2018-03-05
884,Great experience,32059,277,Ally Bank,48337,5,"My husband and I recently decided that we wanted another bank account to manage our money a little better. So we did a little research and found out great things about Ally. We opened both a checking account and a savings account with them and have had nothing but great experiences. The online banking website is user friendly and visually appealing. The customer service is always great. I've talked to them over the phone and through online chat. It has made it so much better for us to manage our money. This has become our bill account. All money goes into here to automatically pay bills so we know they are going out of time. The interest rate in the savings account is great too! We love the 24/7 banking option and that even though it's an online bank, it's easy to deposit checks through their online app and use one of their approved ATMS in the area to withdraw money. Love this bank!",2018-03-03
885,Free checking,32052,277,Ally Bank,48330,3,I am currently banking with Ally. I was looking for a free checking account and was pleasantly surprised to find out they exist. I had a little trouble with my application I filled out online and called the customer service line. I had the sweetest lady help me through the process. She was really easy to talk to and extremely helpful. It was like talking to an old friend. She was able to process my application the same day and get my account up and running. I have been pleased with the service so far with the exception of how long it takes for deposits to process. That is where the free checking comes into play. You get what you pay for.,2018-03-02
886,Ally is great.,32040,277,Ally Bank,48318,5,"I bank with Ally online banking. I love it. No branches means that my interest is higher than traditional banks. My savings account interest was so much last year that I actually had to file it on my taxes. One complaint I have though, is that any and all issues must be dealt with over the phone and sometimes there is a wait to speak with someone, up to 20 minutes. Last summer I was in Europe, and my debit card was flagged because I forgot to notify my bank. The 24/7 help line was useful since I didn't have to account for the time difference and I was able to use my card and withdraw euros from the atm. I would highly recommend to anyone.",2018-03-01
887,Great Online Bank - Ally!,32016,277,Ally Bank,48293,5,"I have been banking with a savings account at Ally bank for about 4 years. I absolutely love it! The interest rate for return has been increasing over the years. What started out as 1% has gone up to 1.49% as of recently. They are reasonable, offer great rates for banking and for home financing. If I did not already go with a preferred lender, I would've definitely gone with them. They have great customer service. I absolutely love that I can transfer money from my savings account to other accounts at other banks and it arrives in 1 business day with no fee! That is my absolute favorite feature with this online bank. I was skeptical at first, but I have referred them to many of my friends who bank there as well now.",2018-02-25
888,Ally is great,31985,277,Ally Bank,48257,4,I have a online savings account with Ally. I have been doing my online banking with them for 3 months now. The number one reason I moved my funds to be with them is their competitive interest rates. They are always keeping their interest rates near the top of the market. When a competitor raises their rates they raise theirs within days. My interaction with the service representatives has been limited. This is primarily because their online sign up and deposit is so easy. I will continue to use their products for the foreseeable future.,2018-02-22
889,Ally Bank Experience,31976,277,Ally Bank,48248,5,"My experience with Ally bank has been an overall positive one. The website is very easy to use. Transferring money to and from other institutions is a breeze. Their products are competitive, often offering the highest interest rate for a CD or savings account. <br/> <br/>It's not perfect. Takes 2 to 3 days to move money to and from Ally bank. Opening an IRA involves printing and document and mailing it to them. Their website has been down for maintenance a bit too often for me.<br/> <br/>Overall, a very good online only bank. Ally Bank is good.",2018-02-21
890,Competitive,31972,277,Ally Bank,48244,5,"Setting up an account was straight forward and easy, I did it all online. The savings account rates are extremely competitive. The user interface is easy to use and navigate. Having looked at their other products, they offer very competitive CD rates and seem to offer a variety of different products. I have not reached out to the company through their phone line at this time so I cannot comment on that aspect of the bank. I have also heard positive reviews from other who bank with them and have recommended them to some of my friends as well. Despite having all of the information online, they also mail out statements which I thought was nice and helpful. Transfers are simple and no fees are charged, at least not on any of the transfers I have done. Overall I have nothing negative to say about the bank.",2018-02-20

Turns out they don't accept deposits through my employer,or my bank (I have to physically mail in a form). The only thing I can do is pay for a wire transfer from my bank to them. Needless to say, I haven't deposited any money into my Roth acct. Looking for someone else as we speak.",2018-02-18

I am thrilled that i actually have a place to park dry powder where someone will talk to you on the phone and chat on the internet within minutes if not seconds. i also told them they have me as long as they keep me happy. the minute they start screwing up it will be the road traveled by CapOne.",2018-02-18
893,Great Bank,31702,277,Ally Bank,47730,4,"I love Ally's checking account. I typically get my paycheck a day before I would otherwise, they have no fees for checking with direct deposit. They waive all ATM fees for online accounts, even though I still have to pay the specific ATM fee. I also like their overdraft service. I had a situation where I had an overdraft and I had three transactions that overdrew the account. Their policy is to waive the first one, but when I called in and talked to a customer service representative, she waived all three fees from that day because she said it was all on the same day. I also like that they now linked my savings account up to my checking account so it will draw from there automatically if I over have an overdraft again. Their website is easy to use as well as mobile banking. I love being able to deposit checks using my phone, it is so much faster.",2018-02-10
894,Easy bank,31698,277,Ally Bank,47726,5,"I have used Ally Bank for 3 years now. I have never had any issues. I started using it when they were offering a much higher interest rate on their savings account than any other bank especially since the market was down. They were almost 1% higher than any other bank that I could find. I have rarely had a reason to contact their customer service but I had one issue where my money was not deposited correctly. This caused my account to be negative and a few transactions to come back as insufficient funds. When I called them, they looked at my account. As soon as the agent pulled up my account, she apologized, said she knew what the problem was and stated that it would be rectified in a few minutes. By the time the call had ended, she had refunded me all the fees, made sure that my deposit was applied correctly and given me an extra $50 in my account as a goodwill for their mistake. I have never had customer service like this so I wasn't quite sure if it was real. They also decided to waive my fees for 3 months for Ally Invest so I was able to make any stock trades for free as well.",2018-02-10
895,"Good Interest, but a long wait to withdraw",31692,277,Ally Bank,47720,4,"I have a savings account with Ally Bank. I chose it because when I was looking up CDs and savings accounts they had the highest interest rates I could find. It feels a little weird not to have any physical place to be able to go to-no ATMS. The downside I think is that when you need to withdraw money you have to schedule it. You don't get it instantly. To my surprise it doesn't work like PayPal. They put up a calendar and you choose a date at a minimum a couple of days in the future for them to transfer it to your other bank account. I really dislike this, but I'm staying for the interest rates.",2018-02-09
896,Bad Banking,31831,277,Ally Bank,41370,1,"I've been a long time customer at Ally, but recently ran into this seemingly crazy conundrum: I wanted to park a sizeable amount of IRA funds in their 3 month CD, because the yield is the rate leader. But the process of opening and funding the account might take 4-6 weeks, and the same time span was quoted for their process on moving that money somewhere else at the end of the term. This came straight from a woman in their IRA dept. Why the delays? Because you can open an account online, but then they'll send you a 'welcome package' you have to fill out and return, have them process it, then transfer funds (ACH is not acceptable), etc. etc. Upon questioning, I found I *could* shorten the process by downloading forms and uploading them via email, which seemed more like 'normal business' to me. But the IRA rep I spoke with absolutely would not give me even a ballpark figure of how much doing things over the web might shorten the in process and out process for funds. 4-6 weeks to set up a 3 month CD? That's crazy! Furthermore, perhaps this is a sign that Ally doesn't have the personnel to do business on reasonable, normal timelines - their 'on hold' phone wait time for a rep seems to average about 20 minutes these days - much higher than it used to be. (Please either tell me what I'm missing here, or alternately, which of the 3 stooges thought up this bank policy?)",2018-02-08
897,I love Ally,31499,277,Ally Bank,47598,5,"Ally Bank is great - especially when it comes to interest fees... at least when compared to my brick and mortar bank. I have a Bank of America account that gives me a few cents of interest each year on my Money Market Account with them. Compared to Ally, this is (literally) pocket change. Ally gives me (at last check) about 1.3% on my savings account which equals out to more than $100 each year! What a difference. Whenever I call them to ask a question, their agents are quick, efficient, and friendly.",2018-02-06
898,"No Frills, Great SErvice",31493,277,Ally Bank,47592,5,"In the day and age of no store fronts, Ally bank certainly provides you with the best rates possible compared to your traditional banks such as Bank of America or Chase. You don't have the ability to go to a bank if you need to talk to someone, but talking to someone over the phone or in chat is quick and easy. In return for a spartan setup, you are rewarded with one of the highest rates of return in your savings account. 1.25% on a savings account compared to say 0.03 % for Bank of America. You have access to many ATMs and you are returned any fees that have been charged for withdrawing money. The mobile app is easy to use and without any bugs, at least for me. I have never had any issues with transfers for deposits via the mobile app. In short, make sure to give it a shot, it doesn't hurt and you'll be earning more back from you hard earned money.",2018-02-05
899,Ally a awsome bank,31488,277,Ally Bank,47587,5,"Ally has truly free checking. They even give you back all fees that were charged from any ATM. The checking is an interest-based checking with no minimum balance required. The money market again has no minimum required and has a great interest rate. It does however have a limited amount of withdrawals you can make per month without a charge. As for the customer service, you can call or chat. Calling is 24 hours a day. The few times I have had to contact them was due to forgetting my online account name and or password. They are always very quick to help and are never rude. Being an online bank, you need to have another bank in your area that you can actually go to if you have paper checks. When i do this the money transfer to ally is always quick.",2018-02-05
900,Needed a savings account,31449,277,Ally Bank,47506,3,"I was looking for a savings account, and I considered going with the typical big banks. After awhile, I realized that I might as well take advantage of the opportunities I had online. Ally was able to provide me with decent rates, and I figured I should go ahead with them. It cut off any time I needed for me to go to an actual bank, and I handled everything online at my convenience. I had been so used to going to a typical bank, that at first I was actually rather skeptical. However, with Ally that went away instantly. I was able to even have the chance to have a card in my name should I have wanted to open a checkings account. Everything about it was incredibly legit.",2018-02-02
901,Ally Bank review,31445,277,Ally Bank,47502,5,"Ally Bank is a great online bank to be in. They don't charge any ATM fees. This is helpful when traveling and need quick cash from any ATM. I could just go to Las Vegas and not worry about any fees from the ATM when I need money. The website looks a old and not as user friendly as others, but they make up for it in their competitive products. Ally offers a great annual percentage rate. The customer service is great too. I can call and get a hold of a representative pretty quickly. I had to check my balance and if a transfer went through late at night and I was able to get a hold of somebody to help me. I don't have to hold or wait a long time like other institutions. Overall, I would rate this online bank as near the top of the list.",2018-02-02
902,Ally - Online Banking,31390,277,Ally Bank,47404,4,"I signed up for Ally banking a few years ago because I needed a savings account. I wanted to get a higher interest rate than the traditional banks so I went with Ally. I believe they can offer a higher interest rate because they are exclusively an online bank. It also was an attractive choice for a savings account because there were no annual fees and no minimum balance needed to held into the account. I signed up and made a small required deposit, I believe it was something like $25. I liked the simplicity of the online banking website they offer. It's very easy to understand and use right away without confusion. All of my transfers went through smoothly and the interest added up right away. One of the things I didn't like about this way of banking was that there was no access to an ATM to withdraw cash. They do not send you a ATM card. So it's good if you want to save and don't need immediate access.",2018-01-29
903,Fast and Reasonable bank,31361,277,Ally Bank,47359,5,"Ally is the first online bank that I have used. At first I was a little skeptical because having some of money in an online bank is a different idea for banking. What I like about Ally is that there is no monthly fees or minimal balance needed to not be charged a fee. Also, with not having ATM fee's that is plus, since there would be no ally specific ATM's to withdraw money from. I also like that there is an free option to send money to other bank's using Pop money service. Most of the interaction I have had with customer service, has been pretty seamless. I did choose to talk to a customer service agent through the chat service. I have not had any issues with the website itself, and it has always been up when I needed to access my account. I did experience having to wait about 10 minutes in order to speak to a customer service agent. In regards to the debit card, I got the card quickly and have not problems using it at stores. I am happy with this bank and would suggest it to others if they feel they want to leave the standard bank and make it a fully online experience.",2018-01-26
904,Why I use Ally Bank.,31348,277,Ally Bank,47346,4,"I have been using Ally Bank for about three years now. They were easy to apply and sign up for. They have no fees for your basic banking functions. You get free checks. You can make deposits several different ways including with your phone, computer or by mailing it in. You get refunds on up to $10.00 a month on any ATM fees. Money transfers are free and easy to use from the website or from the phone app. Also, mobile banking with the phone app works great. You get decent interest rates on your savings and even on your checking accounts. The security has never failed me either, I have had to call in to reactivate my ATM card once or twice, but better to have to do this when they think something is suspicious. Its better to be safe than sorry. Over all I have had a great experience with Ally Bank.",2018-01-25

That is my horrible experience with Ally Bank.<br/>This bank has incredibly long time to get somewhere on the phone when this bank has promotional rates or holidays.<br/>Two weeks ago I waited 40 minutes and lately 30 minutes. <br/>Online Account opening screens seem nice, but if you by mistake press back button -- you are in trouble.<br/>I specified electronic transfer from external bank when I was trying to open CD, but was not sure if confirmation was done properly.<br/>I received e-mail that CD account was opened, but when I tried to log into my online account I've got message that account is disabled.<br/>I called and was told that next Monday I will receive a call from their fraud prevention center to unlock my account.<br/>Nobody called me on Monday. Only Tuesday after short phone conversation they enabled my account, but I already used another bank.<br/>Week later they called me asking if I'd like to fund my CD. This time I was told that they will honor the rate that I had when opened CD, though more than 10 days and promotional rate on the 1 year CD dropped. <br/>I set up funds transfer on the phone. 6 days later I found out that transfer was not executed.<br/>When I called they could not find a record of transfer request. When I specified name and phone number of the person that responsible for the transfer I was told that they do not register calls and requests that go through their back office. And it appears that call was made by their back office employee. <br/>It appears that transfer was not executed, and there was no record of it.<br/>Also customer service told me that I can do the transfer right away, but they will only give me current rate which was less then couple week ago when I opened the CD.<br/>This all situation is outrages!",2018-01-24
907,Incredibly Bad Customer Service And Difficulty Opening Account,31410,277,Ally Bank,47449,1,"Ally gets very poor scores for customer service. I tried to reach a person two times, and waited 40 minutes the first time and 30 minutes the second time. They ran me through the wringer with ID requirements to open the account, asking that I send a copy of a DL (driver's license) and utility bill. I did this, but the bank refused to honor my mailing address (which is on my DL). After all this, they would not let me open my account with an electronic debit, instead saying to send a check or wire money to them. INCREDIBLE! I recently opened an account at a competitor (which I selected because of my problems with Ally) and the account was open in 5 minutes. They pay 0.05 to 0.10% more, but you pay for it. The competitor answered my call in 6 seconds. <br/><br/>If you want to wait on hold for 30+ minutes for any customer service interaction, this is the bank for you!",2018-01-22

911,Ally Bank - One of the Top in the Industry of Online Only Banks,31070,277,Ally Bank,46724,5,"I have had a great experience with Ally Bank. In the past, I have used other online only institutions but all of them have fallen short. Ally does not belong into that category. With Ally, I use it as a high interest savings account, because I find that the brick and mortar banks offer dismal interest rates. I recently completed a transaction from the Ally app on December 6th where I sent $100 from my brick and mortar checking account to my Ally account. The funds posted to my account the next day and both the deductions and additions were reflected correctly in my checking and savings accounts respectively. With the APY for interest accrual at 1.25%, that obliterates the amount you would get at brick and mortar banking institutions. The only thing that would trump it is doing a short to long term CD.",2018-01-14
912,Ally Bank Was Great,31046,277,Ally Bank,46696,3,"I opened a savings account with Ally Bank about three years ago. I wanted another bank to hold my savings account other than my primary bank because it seemed like it would be less tempting to take money out of that account. Well, in some ways this is true. However, Ally makes it very easy to access my money. I do sometimes miss the aspect of having a person to go to when I encounter an issue. However, the people I have talked to through chat and on the phone have been extremely helpful and courteous. I had an issue with getting some money transferred from Ally to my primary bank, and within 5 minutes on chat I was able to resolve my issue. I imagine at some point I will look at transferring completely to an online-only bank, and when that time comes, I will definitely stick with Ally Bank.",2018-01-12
913,Bad Experience,31237,277,Ally Bank,47135,1,"It is taking approximately seven business days for this institution to adhere to the transfer request of my funds. I had to request the same transfer of funds more than once, resulting in a longer period of time to have the transaction completed. This is not why online banking was created. I first initiated the transfer of funds approximately five business days ago online, only not to receive my funds in three days. This morning, I had to verbally initiate the transfer again. Now I have to wait approximately another four business days to hopefully and successfully have my transfer of funds completed. Needless to say, this institution is history for me! I received confirmation numbers for both requests, so I know my first request was completed properly. I cannot and will not have these types of mishaps, when it comes to my hard earned funds. I have had online banking with several institutions over the years and never experienced this type of error! If I did not need my funds in a timely manner, I would not request them.",2018-01-10

The call and chat wait times were > 50 minutes. Never heard back when sending them a ""secure message"" (through their interface). Finally got through to a customer service representative the day after the maturity date -- but they couldn't do anything.

915,I love Ally Bank,31006,277,Ally Bank,46656,5,"Ally Bank is honestly one of the best banks that I've ever had experience with. When I first started out with them, they only had $9 overdraft fees and they were limited to only 1 overdraft fee per day. This, compared to other banks, was amazing to me. Most banks want to charge you $30-$35 overdraft fees and do it on EACH item that comes through after your account has already been overdrafted. It doesn't matter how the transactions are run with most banks; if you have 4 overdraft items, then you'll get 4 overdraft fees. The fact that Ally was willing to do it the way they did was pretty cool to me. To this day, even though their overdraft fees are higher than they used to be, I still think it's the best deal out there as far as checking account features. And their overdraft fees are still lower than other banks at just $25. Their customer service through Live Chat is always amazing, as well.",2018-01-08
916,No fees,30998,277,Ally Bank,46648,3,"I like using Ally bank for our savings account. It is an online-only financial institution, and because of that it offers higher rates. It's a bit cumbersome withdrawing funds from the account and takes at least a few days to receive the money. I'm sure this is much different if you have a checking account with them since they offer a debit card. But i like having the account separate from my other accounts so I'm less likely to dip into my savings for things I really don't need. I've always had great experiences when contacting customer service, which I have done a few times over the course of the years I've had the account.",2018-01-07

I could have opened a separate account with my local branch, but the convenience of Ally bank along with their high interest rates was too good to pass up. Setting up my account was super fast and easy. It only took me minutes after that to set up auto withdrawals, and I can track and control everything from the app on my phone.

You might sometimes be able to find a bank with slightly higher rates but they tend to be inconsistent; Ally is always near the top. <br/><br/>But the real deciding factor is their great easy-to-use website. For example: I had a couple of Ally no-penalty CDs at 1.50% when Ally offered new ones at 1.75%. I wouldn't bother swapping for only 10 basis points, but a 25 point increase caught my attention. It literally took me less than 5 minutes to close both of my old accounts and use the proceeds to fund the new ones! No hassle, and I'm happy!<br/><br/>The only place they are lacking is customer service. The wait time to speak to a rep was about 30 min. and the chat wait time was even longer.

920,A Low Cost And Easy To Use Bank,30929,277,Ally Bank,46469,4,Ally Bank has been nothing but helpful and easy to use for the many years I have banked with them. I originally opened a checking account with them because I was intrigued by the no cost of maintaining an account as well as the no ATM fees regardless of what ATM you use. They have stayed true to their word over all these years and still do not charge any fees for a checking account. I have since opened another checking account as well as a savings account with them and the process to do so was extremely simple and took less than five minutes. I can access all of my bank account through one login on the site or mobile app and all the information I need is displayed in an easy to understand way.,2018-01-01

Initially I had to correct my wife's last name on our account as she has 2 last names and I only told ally of one of the last names, and they refused to cash her paycheck. Took them a week and a half to update my wife's last name, pretty lame. But I learned over the years online banks in general work slower at times to do basic stuff like getting a same day cashier's check to make your last payment on a house (not happening, it will take a week at least), just the nature of the beast.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with the trade off and ally's 24/7 I/M chat, no nonsense clearly laid out webpage, samsung pay compatible, and $15 checking atm fee reimbursement, is GREAT.",2017-12-30

It is easy to move money both to and from my accounts. Generally I see deposits within a 24 -48 hour period. I like that I can also use the check deposit with the app and it only takes about 24 hours to see the funds in my Money Market account. The only issue I've had is when I tried to add my significant other to my account, they would not accept his drivers license because it had a different address - we had recently moved in with each other and therefore his address had not been updated on his actual drivers license.

App and website are both very convenient, and the savings account has a great interest rate. When my account information was stolen (I've unfortunately been subject to a lot of data breaches in the last few years), Ally was swift to cancel my card, notify me, and work me through the charges. I was due to leave the country for an extended period of time, and they expedited a new debit card to me, free of charge. My one and only complaint is that it's difficult/impossible to get cash deposited into an account since it's online only. So if you work a job where a lot of your take-home pay is cash (e.g., working for a restaurant for tips), then you might want to consider a different bank. This isn't an issue for me, so it hasn't affected my rating.",2017-12-22

Then said they could setup a UGMA account. I told him I will call back since that did not sound right. After checking it info online, it mentioned to call for custodial accounts. I then got another even lesser qualified CS agent who said she could help but required me to repeat everything at least 2-3x because she couldn't hear. I then asked if I could if there was a way I could enter the information online and she proceeded to direct me back to online to setup a UGMA/Trust account and said to check trust. What she failed to mention after I hung up was that Trust needed to be place before the account could be setup.<br/>I then decided this wasn't a good start and proceeded to go to Discover which got setup (3 accounts) in 15 minutes with excellent service by the CSR on the phone.

Additionally the options to set up a savings account or money market account is very user friendly. I have not used their customer service as of yet because I have not had an issue with the account or any of the services. The app is very user friendly as well and it has great self serve options.

I also like the online-only nature of the bank because it makes it less likely for me to tap into the accounts and spend frivolously. The interest rate is one of the best out there - as of the time of this writing it's at 1.25%, compounded daily. There are no fees I've experienced in the course of normal banking. The one time I had to use customer service, it was easy and I was able to reach a human in a minimal amount of time. Don't let the online-only nature scare you away.

I was amazed at how quickly I was able to open the account, set up an electronic transfer to fund the account and then set up the recurring transfer that I was going to be doing monthly. I was also able to make it a joint account with my husband and there was a simple process for him to verify the account information for himself after I was done.

So far, I've had nothing but great experiences with Ally, though I have yet to speak to a customer service representative, simply because things have run so smoothly, that I haven't had to. Their interest rates are competitive, and some of the highest I've seen recently. Transferring money over is quick and easy, just link an external bank account and it just takes a click of a button. When you input the amount to transfer, they even have ""pre-determined"" amounts of $50, $100, $150, $200, etc...just to save you a little extra time typing. Transferring from your savings account is easy, as well, and quicker, as it only takes a day or two to appear in your bank account. My only little qualm so far is that it takes several days to transfer into your savings account, as opposed to transferring to an external bank.<br/> <br/>I will be a customer of Ally as long as their service remains steady, and their interest rates remain competitive!",2017-11-29

After a bit more research I found that Ally had a savings account that was paying 10 times the national average. I immediately opened an account online.

If I need to get cash out, I can do it at ANY ATM and the fee is reimbursed to my account - no need to search around for my bank's atm's! Another thing I love is that if we overdraw from checking, they will just pull it from savings with no fee. This has saved us a lot of money! And, the rates are still very competitive with other banks, so I'm confident we're getting the most bang for our buck.",2017-11-26
938,Need an online bank? I recommend Ally Bank!,30497,277,Ally Bank,45427,5,"I joined Ally Bank, an online bank, only at the beginning of this year. I did some research and went with Ally because they seemed to have the most experience and very good ratings overall by long time users. I spend a lot of time overseas and was looking to open a checking account with zero fees and a minimum opening deposit. I wanted something that was easy to use but safe and Ally offers a number of security steps to minimize andy breaches. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars in web/mobile experience is because, as an online bank, I would expect for certain services to be available 24/7. However, all the deposits I make on Fridays and weekends, I normally don't see in my account until Monday morning. I think you should be able to make a transfer or deposit to your account 364 days a year and be able to see the money in your account in real time. I'm not sure if that is the case with any bank, but I really think that, since everything is automated, it should be possible. The customer service reps are excellent and knowledgeable. They tried to help me open an account when I was overseas and, though it ended up being impossible and I had to wait till I got back home to NY, they still tried their best to help me. I appreciate their time and effort.",2017-11-25
939,Comfortable online banking,30490,277,Ally Bank,45420,4,"It has been a superb experience for me banking online with Ally bank. I was not that comfortable with the online bank only idea in the beginning. But once I used it, I never felt the need to physically visit the bank. The online site is very comfortable and user friendly. Never have I had any kind of issues till date. All the facilities are extremely useful. The facility has been perfectly to my taste when I need to urgently transfer money to someone. The transfer has been instant and hassle free. I would suggest this bank to anyone. Transfer of money to other banks have also been very good. My only concern is that fees are little bit on the higher side.",2017-11-24
940,Online banking made simple and easy,30443,277,Ally Bank,45301,5,"Honestly Ally is great for pretty much everyone. They don't have any minimum balance requirements, they don't have withdrawal limits or fees, they give a generous amount of interest on savings accounts. I'd had a savings account with them for multiple years now and I've never come across any problems. It's extremely easy to add a bank or set up a transfer to or from another account or bank. Depositing checks is also a breeze. You just scan the front and back, upload the pictures, and you're done! Easy as pie. Ally is honestly the easiest bank I've ever had to work with. If you ever do need customer support, the wait times are incredibly short at just a minute or so. I would highly recommend Ally to anyone who's tired of excessive fees for every little thing, or tired of being confused by poorly designed websites.",2017-11-22
941,Great Bank,30532,277,Ally Bank,45472,5,"I started researching online banks in October due to the absolute low interest rate on CD's. I was somewhat leary of investing in such but after reading the reviews and the interest rates being paid, I decided to try Ally out for a small CD account. I opened a small CD account with no problems and very easy to do. I also like the app which is also easy to operate. I then opened a savings account and am having monthly transfers made with no problems. I found the customer service to be very helpful and can understand every word they speak. I am very happy here but I still maintain a checking account at my former bank Wells Fargo.",2017-11-22
942,Ally Bank: A Suprisingly Effective Direct Deposit Solution,30410,277,Ally Bank,45268,4,"I have been using Ally Bank for my deposits for almost two years now. At first I was leery, having never used an online bank solution before, but their sign-up process was easy enough and once I linked my payroll to them to set up direct deposits the rest was a breeze. They typically get me my deposits either the SAME business day they're sent through or the very next morning at the latest. As opposed to my usual credit union, that's a surprisingly quick turn around time. My only wish was that their app, Ally Mobile, was more user friendly. It sometimes glitches out on me when I'm trying to check my balance, forcing me to log back in. Other than that, I have no interest in pursuing other banking options at this time.",2017-11-18
943,Really Great Experience!,30388,277,Ally Bank,45206,4,"I had been using Ally Bank for all my banking needs. When my wife and I decided we should start saving for a housing down payment, My other bank's interest rate wasn't cutting it. I heard some great reviews about Ally's 1.00% APR and we decided to jump in. Since joining, the rate climbed to 1.25%! Transferring funds to and from our account is super simple, their app is super intuitive and user friendly, and we have not had any problems, only good experiences.",2017-11-17
944,banking with ally,30382,277,Ally Bank,45200,3,I thought I would try out an online banking experience by trying Ally Bank. There were a lot of advertisements on my television for the company so I decided to bank with them. The account was easy to open and the deposit and withdrawal process was easy as well. I did have an occurrence when my account was hacked and it was a pain trying to get the customer service to dispute the money that was withdrawn from my account fraudulently. I had to speak to multiple people regarding the issue and it took about two weeks to correct the issue. There were fees associated with the account everytime I used an ATM which I also did not like. Overall I am happier banking with a bank that has a physical office I can go to.,2017-11-16
945,Ally bank-online,30312,277,Ally Bank,44969,4,"I love banking online with Ally Bank. I like to use their app on my phone to manage my account. Their checking account and savings account both are free and offer decent rates. I can take a picture of any check and deposit it straight into my account. I can easily transfer money between my accounts, which is nice whenever I need to cover an extra expense. I like their online chat platform and the people have been easy to work with. Overall, I would recommend them and have recommended them to several family members who, like me, don't have the time to go to a physical bank.",2017-11-11
946,I was hesitant at first but..,30191,277,Ally Bank,44612,5,"I was hesitant at first about using an online only bank but after seeing the interest rates for my savings account, I was sold. Since it is 2017 and you can do so many things via the internet, the days of the brick and mortar bank branches are over. First of all, the majority of my income is deposited into my bank account via direct deposit. And with the feature of depositing a check with the Ally mobile app, it saves me a lot of time. Also, the fact that Ally will waive up to $10 ATM fees, I will just take out about $200 a month and also I just don't like carrying cash with me. I've had Ally for my car loan and the customer services was just so exceptional that I had to look into getting a checking and savings account with them. The entire process was very quick and straightforward and the rates is amazing. I'm even thinking about getting an Ally credit card from them as well.",2017-11-07
947,Ally Bank,30183,277,Ally Bank,44604,5,"About two months ago, I opened an online bank account with Ally online bank. I love the ease of access and the customer service. The set up only took about 20 minutes! I now deposit all of my finances to the account. The debit card and checks arrived easily too. Overall, the experience with Ally bank has been wonderful.",2017-11-07
948,Great easy to use online bank.,30179,277,Ally Bank,44600,5,Ally has really been a very easy to use and stress free online banking option. I make a lot of transfers and by far they had the fastest of any other institutions I have used. You transfer and the money is there the very next day. Their rates as far as savings seem to be way better than any traditional bank I've seen. The account opening process was very easy and stress free. Best of all their services are completely free. The only disadvantage is that they do not have physical branches so if you have cash to deposit that you need available quickly you are in a disposition but fortunately I don't come across that problem a lot. Overall I would highly recommend Ally to anyone looking for a great online bank.,2017-11-06
949,AllyBank- A pleasant Surprise,30162,277,Ally Bank,44584,5,"Ally Bank was my first experience with online banks, and to be honest, I wasn't too keen on it. I wasn't sure I trusted the idea of giving a bank my money, when they didn't have a physical place for me to go and get assistance if needed. I was worried about being scammed. Ally Bank truly showed me that not all banks are created equal. I prefer and still use them for my savings accounts. Every time I call customer service, they are always ready and enthusiastic about helping me, which makes me feel safe to continue using them. The interest rate is excellent as well. The interest rate for online banks is typically higher than brick and mortar banks; which is true in this case . The interest rate is higher than most other online banks as well. <br/>All in all, it has been a wonderful experience with them and I'm sure it will continue being so. I recommend them to everyone who is looking for a savings account.",2017-11-05
950,Great Online Bank for a Savings Account,30155,277,Ally Bank,44577,4,"I had some extra money and wanted to deposit it into an account that would offer high interest so I could gain money. This money was previously in my checking account at Compass bank, and my particular account did not have any interest, so my money was just sitting there and not gaining any money. I did some research online, and found Ally Bank. It is an online bank and they offer many different savings accounts, CDs, checking accounts, etc. I was a little skeptical because I had never used an online-only bank account before. After doing some research, I found them to be a reputable and reliable bank. This gave me confidence in the security of the bank. Further research revealed that they offered the highest interest I could find online (at the time I believe it was 1.05%, compounded daily), and now it is 1.20%. I am very happy with the interest rate, and their customer service department is available 24/7. They have an online chat feature which is very convenient and the agents are very knowledgeable and helpful. I would recommend this bank to anyone who wants a high interest rate and great customer service.",2017-11-03
951,Literally the only bank I've ever been happy with.,30134,277,Ally Bank,44541,5,"I absolutely love Ally. I previously had Chase bank for about 7 years and had so many hassles with them: fees, low interest rates, issues causing me to have to physically go to the bank, etc. All of those problems disappeared with Ally. They reimburse ATM fees in case I ever need to take out cash, I can deposit checks easily from my phone, send money to people on my phone, and I get AMAZING interest rates. I'm getting the same rate on my checking account now that I used to get on my savings, and my savings rate is over 10 times as much! The only complaint I have is that there is no way to deposit cash, but that's such a minor issue compared to all the positives. I recommend Ally to absolutely everyone, it's just such a better way to bank than traditional banks.",2017-11-03
952,Don’t Deposit Any Checks If Account Is New,30267,277,Ally Bank,44821,1,I deposited a tax refund check a month after I opened my account. Ally completely locked me out of online and mobile access to my account for 5 business days because they couldn’t reach the issuer of the check to verify the check. They also cancelled my prescheduled incoming ach transfer during this period ( initiated from ally account). <br/>Luckily I’m not using this accoubt to pay my bills so the impact for me is minimal but I can see this being a big problem for some. <br/>I asked if they could put a hold on the check but still let me log into my account but they said there was no such option. This seems unreasonable as I never had problem cashing or depositing checks with any other bank.,2017-11-02
953,"Terrible Security, Terrible Customer Service",30253,277,Ally Bank,44781,1,"I am astonished at the incompetence of this company. 2 weeks ago, my husband noticed fraudulent charges, completely out of line with our typical account activity. When I called to report it they said they would put a dispute in and shut the card down for me. 2 days later we found the rest of our account had been completely drained. When I called to inquire why, they had allowed the people fraudulently using our account to reopen it and drain the rest of the funds. They never notified us that our card was being used in a different part of the country or for large cash withdrawls which is completely unlike us AND they allowed them to continue even after I reported the fraud and shut the card down. They actually reopened the card for them. Over the next few days I spent countless hours on the phone with numerous customer service representatives who had no idea what they were doing and could not offer me any additional security on my account. About 5 days after the initial report, I spoke with a representative who informed me the first representative had never filed a dispute. So they lied and did nothing to help me get the funds back. That representative disputed the fraudulent activity. At this point, daycare, the mortgage, and electric bill are not getting paid. They assured me my case was the highest priority for their loss prevention team, then assigned it to someone on vacation. Finally, they gave me a provisional credit for the funds and now won't let me access it so now, 2 weeks later, we are still unable to pay our mortgage or any other bills. I just spend hours on the phone being bounced around to different departments all with no idea what they are doing. I can't go into a branch to see a person either. Also, I've compared their security to other banks and it's pitiful. Even my credit union allows a secret password on the account but they don't. Most other banks allow a security code to be sent to your phone or email before being able to get access to the account when speaking with a rep. They don't (although they have the option for online login, but that did nothing to protect me). We will never bank here again.",2017-10-31
954,Ally Is My Trusted Bank Since I moved to a City.,30100,277,Ally Bank,44471,4,I moved from my small hometown earlier this year. Which means I had to find a new bank. I chose Ally because of their high interest rate savings account. I was able to transfer my monies to them with ease and they haven't given me any trouble when ever I have questions or concerns about the product they are offering. I feel that my money is safe in their hands and it is nice knowing that my savings are earning some decent interest instead of just sitting there like at my previous bank. As for my checking account that I use a debit card with. It has given me no troubles what so ever and their mobile app allows me to keep track of my balance whenever I want.,2017-10-30
955,Ally Bank Experience,30083,277,Ally Bank,44410,4,"My experience with Ally has been great. I'm a very light user, and haven't delved into CDs, investing, etc., beyond basic savings and checking usage. A big reason for this was because I move very often, and their mobile app and support is fantastic. Depositing checks from my phone is very simple. The app has a built in scanner to take pictures of the checks. Their customer support is great as well. I tried to withdraw money from an ATM that did not give any cash but still marked itself as having done so. Their customer support refunded the money to my checking account in half an hour. <br/> <br/>One of the other features that is very nice with their deposit accounts is the lack of a minimum balance combined with a nice interest rate. My interest on my savings account is 1.19% APY. So, that's nice. Also, any ATM withdrawal fee is refunded to my account within 48 hours. <br/> <br/>I'm sorry I can't give you much more than the most casual of usage, but I hope the information is helpful.",2017-10-29
956,Best Banking,30081,277,Ally Bank,44408,4,"I originally opened my Ally savings account because of the great interest rates. However, since I have had the account for the last three years, I have decided that it is the best banking experience I've had so far. First, if I want to withdraw money, I have to really think about if I need it because it is not readily accessible. I can't just drive up to a brick and mortar location and take the money out. However, if I do need the money for something, I am able to transfer it to my other checking account and use it accordingly with no fees charged. I like this feature very much. In addition, Ally seems to truly care about my privacy and security and makes sure that my information is kept safe.",2017-10-29
957,Consider using Ally,30058,277,Ally Bank,44383,5,"I have been a long-standing customer of brick and mortar type banks, but after a recent move to a location that is not within reasonable distance to my usual bank, I opted to try an online bank. The process for signing up for an account was seamless and my partner was easily added to my account via a signature and return envelope. I have only needed to speak with their customer service representation on one occasion and my question was answered quickly with minimal hold time on the phone. The ability to take photos through the app for check deposit is incredibly easy and I have not yet needed to take multiple pictures of my check because it blurry or out of angle like I have done with my previous banking institution. I also like that my limit on check deposits is higher so if I have multiple higher dollar check amounts I do not have to hold onto them for several days. I am also impressed that they offer interest on my checking account with charging huge fees to just keep my money with them, let alone be required to have a high balance to avoid any fees, they are perfect for the typical working person. I recently recommended Ally.com to a friend who was having issues obtaining an account at a local back because she hadn't yet had her license changed to reflect her new address. With Ally.com this was not an issue and she was able to get an account that day. I feel that my money is safe with this institution and have the customer's needs in mind.",2017-10-26

No fees for checking, plus a small amount of interest on the account are great features. Very low overdraft fee as well.",2017-10-24
959,Banking With An Ally,30006,277,Ally Bank,44284,4,"I chose this bank because I moved away from my hometown where I only used a local bank. I needed to be able to make deposits online and use it primarily on mobile. I emailed customer service with some general questions, and they replied almost immediately by answering but not pushing me to join the bank. It included all the things I need, like using my Masterpass or using my Microsoft Wallet. I never have to worry about my information being discovered by a third party or there being a data breach, which is similar to my former local bank but something I value in a bank I didn't know much about that I took a chance on using. I also use an Ally credit card and it allows me to get a 2% cash back on grocery stores and for getting gas. It isn't a lot but it's something, a little perk that makes me feel a little better about spending money sometimes. I had an issue once where I was charged a $1 fee at a gas station 3 times instead of just once, and Ally resolved it for me right away. I don't have anything bad to say about them, and I prefer them over any big name bank out there because the experience is more personal and just as secure.",2017-10-22
960,A Great and Reliable Online Bank,30004,277,Ally Bank,44282,5,"I've been banking with Ally for more than 5 years and only have positive things to say. They have very attracting CD and, checking, and savings account interest rates, along with very accessible customer service. Their website is very easy to use and navigate and the lack of fees are very very good. I have no intention of ever switching to a brick and mortar or other online bank, as ally has everything that suits my needs - an efficient and reliable bank that I can access easily online. It's also very easy to link accounts at other banks for quick and efficient ach transfers and the debit cards have very good fee rebates. Every time I've called their customer service, I have never had to wait long either. <br/> <br/>I highly recommend using ally bank. I know they also specialize in car loans, but that is one of the few services that they offer that I have not used, but would consider doing so in the future, due to my positive experiences with everything else that they offer.",2017-10-21
961,Great Experience With Ally Bank,29999,277,Ally Bank,44277,4,"I recently opened an account with Ally Bank. The setup was incredibly easy and straightforward. Getting the account ready to go took less than 2 days with a transfer of money from my old bank. Both the checking and savings account offer very competitive interest rates, I believe the savings account has one of the best rates available. The only downside is if you forget your password to your online account you have to make a phone call, which can be annoying. Many other institutions offer sending a new password setup key via email or phone.",2017-10-21
962,Ally Online Bank,29981,277,Ally Bank,44257,4,"Last year my local bank decided to upgrade their web portal. It was basically a disaster. I was locked out of my account for nearly a week at a time when I needed to retrieve records for some financial statements. This was very inconvenient. They kept sending emails saying oops, this hasn't worked like we thought it would so it will be just another couple of days and you can access your account. Not only could I not access my savings and checking account, but I was blocked from my bill pay as well. It was at that point I started looking elsewhere for a place to do my banking. I had taken several loans from Ally in the past so I looked into starting an account with them. Come to find out that since I had taken loans from them before, I already had an account. All I had to do was choose the savings and checking options to start banking there so I did. Transferring my funds was painless and I was suprised to find out that even though I couldn't log into my old account, I could still transfer the funds from Ally. I was concerned about deposits since they don't have a local brick and mortar store but it turns out I can make deposits on paper checks even easier by using the camera on my phone. Wait time for help is never very long and they are always super helpful and patient. In the end, I kept my accounts at my old bank but do all of my banking and bill pay from Ally now because I like it there. They have better rates too.",2017-10-19
963,Ally bank is all its cracked up to be.,29972,277,Ally Bank,44237,4,"I was skeptical about joining ALLY bank because of the commercials and making sure I wasn't jumping into something just because of advertising. However, I was surprised from the start. Their fees are low and their customer service is really great. I liked how it is very easy to get someone on the phone rather than having to wait for 20+ minutes at my brick and mortar bank. Everything at ALLY is black and white, you aren't trying to figure out fee's or what checks aren't depositing. They are the most consistent bank I've ever banked with. It's convenient for me because I can make mobile deposits from my phone and I have the money the next day. Rarely do they hold any checks and that's what I'm looking for in a bank. Their savings interest rates are great to because they don't have the over head that brick and mortar banks do. I recommend them to anyone looking for something else with a bank. I highly recommend and you won't be disappointed!!",2017-10-19
964,Ally is a great online bank!,29786,277,Ally Bank,43552,4,"I have been a customer of Ally Bank for several years and currently have a checking and savings account there. In the past, I have also bought CD's from Ally when I didn't need to use the money for a year or two. Even though it's only an online bank with no physical branches, I think it's the best bank! It has 24/7 customer service, using employees in the United States who are very helpful and have always been polite and knowledgable. It also pays one of the highest interest rates for checking and savings accounts, and its fees are easy to find on the website. Because it has no physical branches, Ally also refunds all ATM fees (without requiring me to do anything) from any location in the United States. Ally Bank allows for check deposits using my phone camera, which is very easy to use. They have also recently started using the chip technology on all debit cards to help protect me from identity theft. What more could I want from a bank than excellent interest rates, 24-hour customer service, free nationwide ATM's, and banking online at any time. Great company!",2017-10-16
965,Ally Bank Initial Thoughts,29780,277,Ally Bank,43545,5,"I was in the market for a higher yield savings account for short term savings (I work as a teacher, so I was saving money for the summer months). I began by searching for the highest interest rates for online only banks. I had a whole list of banks to look at. I first checked their interest rates, their fees, and then their reviews. One after another they all had poor reviews, mostly relating to the same thing: changing interest rates. From reading all these reviews and a few articles, I learned that many online only accounts will offer really high interest rates to entice people to join, and then drop down below the average online banks. So then I began looking at some of the bigger more well known online banks, and came to Ally. Ally caught my attention for having a decent interest rate, no fees, good customer service, an app, mobile check depositing, and an advertised 10-minute or less sign up. So I decided on Ally. It really did take only 10 minutes to sign up. It did take me an additional day to link my checking account though, as I had to wait for their two random deposits to verify my account. This all happened just two days ago, so I have not funded my account yet, but I have used the website and app to get my feel for using it, and both are very user friendly.",2017-10-15
966,Ally with Ally,29764,277,Ally Bank,43529,3,"Ally Bank is a solid online bank that offers competitive interest rates for new savings accounts. Basically, the more money you have to stow away, the more able you are to fully utilize what Ally has to offer. I like to call my Ally Savings Account my ""rainy day fund"" because it is easy to maintain and it seems secure and safe. I have opened CD accounts with them in the past which has been nice. I have deposited funds into the account via check which is easy to do, and customer service is a delight to deal with. If you ever need the funds that you save with Ally, you can link a separate bank account to it and withdrawals take about 1-2 days, which is great and fast. Overall I am impressed with Ally.",2017-10-12
967,Ally bank review,29722,277,Ally Bank,43467,5,"I have had an Ally savings account for over three years now. I like it so much that about a year ago I opened another savings account. The automatic transfers are easy to set up and make recurring. The interface is easy to use and view exactly where my accounts are at. In particular I like the interest rate that I earn, which is far superior to any rate that I would receive from a typical brick-and-mortar bank. I would highly recommend Ally to anyone that is interested in setting up a savings account. The interest rates alone make it worth it, and getting money in and out is just as easy as with a traditional bank.",2017-10-08
968,Best savings account,29706,277,Ally Bank,43449,5,Ally has the best dedicated savings account I have ever used. This would be my third account for savings and I have had the best experience with Ally. It is now the only savings account that I use. They make the transfer process incredibly easy and straight forward. I am able to deposit checks directly into this account. I love the ease of using both their online website as well as their mobile application on my phone. And the best point is their interest rate. It is one of the highest available for a no fee savings account and has gradually risen even higher since I first opened the account. I would highly recommend getting an ally account to anyone interested in opening a dedicated savings account.,2017-10-06

I have no problems with that bank; however, I finally got tired of earning .1% return on my savings account. I put up with it for so long because I was expecting to use that money and didn't expect to have it in the account for that long. Well, months turned to years and I finally sat down and figured out how much I lost in interest compared to an online bank. So I pulled the funds and opened an account at Ally. Now I earn over 1%. True, 1% isn't that much more exciting than .1% but it's better than being spat on and I'll find a use for the extra hundreds of dollars per year.",2017-10-02

They have extremely competitive rates and are often higher than other banks especially when it comes to their savings accounts. I love not having to go anywhere and deal with anyone, however, their customer service is very helpful if you happen to need it. I chose an online only account because I figured it would help with discipline. My experience has been great and I have had no problems!

971,Ally is My Ally,29616,277,Ally Bank,43297,5,"I started using Ally banking services a few years ago and it's been one of the greatest decisions of my life.

I only have a savings account with them, but Ally offers one of the highest annual percentage yield that I've seen for savings accounts. And there's also no monthly fees for having an account with them, which is also super awesome. Signing up with them literally only took like a minute and it's just been a pleasure handling my finances with Ally ever since. The one thing that has been kind of a hassle though is their limitation on how many checks I can write every month. They restrict me to only writing 6 checks per month using Ally, which I was worried about at first, but I rarely ever need to actually write checks these days so it's been ok so far on that front.",2017-09-27
972,Amazing bank,29566,277,Ally Bank,43180,5,"I was able to open an account on this site so easily. I had a lot of fun setting it up. I got some info in the mail from them and I was ready to go. The customer service was really good. The man I talked to on the phone told me about how they work and I was not sure about them, since they were an online only bank. My favorite thing about this bank is the fact that they do not have an annual fee. That is a huge thing with me. The last bank I was with had a fee of six dollars a month. This is one of the only banks that does not have a fee. They also have interest compounded daily, which is really unique.",2017-09-24
973,Ally Bank,29564,277,Ally Bank,43178,3,"I banked with Ally Bank for a short time while I was living abroad. It was easy to keep track of my finances with their online services. I was pleased that I was able to contact customer service with any issues and still get what I need... it wasn't difficult like I thought it was going to be. I was pleased that I was able to monitor my accounts while feeling like my funds were safe. I used primary checking and savings with automatic payments set up and had very rare issues with anything for the year or so that I used Ally Bank. The transition to an account when I got back to the states was easy too! Overall, I was happy with how this worked, especially since it wasn't an ideal situation.",2017-09-24
974,Excellent online bank,29558,277,Ally Bank,43172,4,"Ally is an excellent online banking institution. I found it on numerous searches and best lists for places to store money. It has very low fees. Interest rates are some of the best for savings accounts as well as cd's. I have savings, money market, and Cds with ally. I feel that my money grows more quickly. It is federally insured as well so I feel secure having my money wth them. Customer support is top notch. They are always quick to assist my needs. I get assistance and help immediately. I have never felt frustrated with this banks. Previous banks left me feeling taken advantage of",2017-09-23
975,Competitive High Interest Rates,29538,277,Ally Bank,43148,5,"Ally Bank offers premier mobile and online banking and savings accounting. Their high yield savings account boasts consistently at or above average interest rates (currently 1.20% APY). They also have no maintenance fees, and offer a very user-friendly, efficient online banking scheme. Their online notification system is excellent (using emails and online inboxes) to provide updates pertinent to the account such as interest rate changes. The restrictions on accounts are clearly defined and communicated (for example a maximum number of transactions limit per account cycle). Ally offers a wide variety of online products, such as CDs, Money Markets, Interest Checking, High Interest Savings, IRAs, and loans. Overall, this bank gets a 5 out of 5 stars rating. I would highly recommend this bank to friends and family.",2017-09-22
976,Best online bank,29525,277,Ally Bank,43115,5,"I opened an account with Ally bank, from my bedroom on the computer. I did not need to get up and get ready and go anywhere. My account was up and running in under 15 minutes. All items I needed were mailed to me. A debit card, checks, deposit slips and self-addressed envelopes. The rates are very good and all my transactions are done through their app. When I use my card at an ATM and there is a charge, I receive that money back at the end of the month. There are no maintenance fees. This is by far the best bank I have ever used in my life. Brick and mortar banks are in the past and online only banks are the way of the future.",2017-09-20
977,Online Banking with Ally,29522,277,Ally Bank,43112,5,"I have had several accounts with Ally bank for at least 8 years; savings, checking, CD, Money market, and IRA. I have transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars in and out of these accounts while buying and selling real estate. I have not had even one bad experience with this bank. <br/> <br/>Customer service is excellent. The representatives are very efficient, and have always resolved my questions to my complete satisfaction. Transactions are always timely.<br/> <br/>The web site is intuitive and very easy to navigate. I rarely need to contact customer service since I can handle almost everything myself. When I make transfers to other financial institutions I know exactly when I am going to receive my money. There is a graphical interface on the opening page that gives a clear picture of how your money is allocated among my accounts. This is my favorite banking site. <br/> <br/>The interest rate at Ally is always higher than the major banks and the credit union that I belong to. They even offer a credit card that gives a nice cash back opportunity if you deposit the ""cash"" in an Ally account.",2017-09-20
978,Ally is awesome,29336,277,Ally Bank,42541,5,"I really enjoy using Ally bank. I used to be a Chase user for my savings, but when I signed up for Ally I definitely felt like I was dealing with a more trustworthy bank. I really like their interest rate they provide for the customers for savings. I also think it's has more mobility then most online banks. I think they need to start being a bit more competitive because other companies are catching on and doing the same thing, but the truth is is that they did it first. That makes what they offer more believable to me. It's very accessible for an online bank, and I like that I'm able to check out money a decent amount of times per month (about 5 I think). Overall, they're a very good bank, and I'll recommend it to anyone that is looking for a new place to stash their savings.",2017-09-17
979,Review of Ally Bank,29329,277,Ally Bank,42534,4,"I decided to switch my short term and long term savings accounts from a brick and mortar retail with my current banking institution (Bank of America) to an entirely online bank account with Ally.<br/> <br/>The main reason I decided to switch was to make it more of a ""hassle"" to get to for lack of a better word. I thought that if my savings were not tied to my main account it would be easier to forget about and save accordingly.<br/> <br/>If I were to transfer the money back to another account, I could do so in 24 hours. I love the ease of accessing my money in the case of an emergency. Also - I automatically draft a certain dollar amount out of each check to each account which is a breeze. Monthly, I transfer money from Bank of America to Ally, which is not as difficult as I thought it originally may have been.<br/> <br/>I would highly recommend an online bank account to anyone, specifically Ally. I currently earn 1 percent interest on my available funds in the account, which is leaps and bounds higher than any other lending institution would have provided. The APY is high, the convenience of doing business, and the ease of accessing my funds are my main reasons for sticking with Ally. I highly recommend them.",2017-09-17
980,Ally Bank,29320,277,Ally Bank,42525,4,"I have been banking with Ally for about 1 year. I like how they have excellent customer service. I opened a checking account with them because they offered an interest-based checking account with low minimums. It is very easy to access my account, deposit money, withdraw/transfer money and set up direct deposit. I only keep a small amount in here at most times. It comes in very handy when I travel and need reserve funds in case my wells fargo account puts a hold on my checking/credit card. It has happened before and Ally has helped out a lot. I don't use any other services other than a checking account through Ally but I know they offer many. I only wanted a checking account through a strictly online banking institution and Ally has provided me with everything that I need and exceeded my expectations.",2017-09-16
981,Ally Bank- Get Your Feet Wet With Online Banking,29309,277,Ally Bank,42514,4,"I've been an Ally Bank member for a little over a year and I have been very happy with the experience. At first I was a little apprehensive because I have always dealt with brick and mortar banks, but I felt it was time to give this one a try. What was most appealing to me was the interest rate, which was well over 1% at the time I joined. It's not much, but it is something and it adds up over time. In addition to the interest rate, you also don't have any of the typical fees that you get with a traditional bank. They even reimburse you for ATM transactions. I have several bank accounts and what I can say is that there is absolutely no difference between how I interact with Ally and how I do 98% of my transactions with my other banks. Looking back I have had no issues with Ally.",2017-09-14
982,Easy and Convenient.,29257,277,Ally Bank,42430,5,"As the title says, signing up and using Ally Bank for checking and savings services is easy and convenient. I was looking for a good online bank that I could have my online business/work income be deposited into. I wanted something that either had a low or no signup fee. Ally Bank allowed me to signup rather easily and required no signup fee. I was given a checking and savings account within minutes and I was able to start using this account once I made my first deposit. I was sent a Mastercard debit card within two weeks and some temporary checks. Having this account is rather convenient in that I can use their mobile app to access information about my account such as balances, deposits, and withdrawals at the touch of a button. I've had this account for over a year now and it's been a pleasure doing business with this institution and I would highly recommend this for anyone who has no need for visiting an actual brick and mortar bank.",2017-09-08
983,A Great Bank if You Never Need to go to it,29208,277,Ally Bank,42324,5,"I love Ally Bank! I love the fact that they don't have fees for transfers, ATMs, or on their accounts. It makes me feel like I'm not constantly being charged money for the use of my money. Their online banking is easy to use and I love their app. I'm able to deposit checks using my phone. The customer service people are helpful and you don't have to wait too long waiting on assistance. And another awesome thing is that they refund any ATM charges you have. Wonderful.",2017-09-06
984,Interest rates that make brick & mortar obsolete,29204,277,Ally Bank,42319,5,"I have both a checking account and several savings accounts with Ally Bank due to their high interest rates and how easy it is to open accounts with them. The account opening process takes minutes and there are no minimum balance requirements. Every single time I've called customer service, I've had such a great experience. Their customer service representatives are knowledgeable available 24/7.<br/>The most recent account I opened was an additional savings account. I called because I had questions about the transfer limits and the representative didn't just answer my question, but explained why there were transfer/withdrawal limits on savings accounts. She took the time to explain how the federal regulation that governs these accounts limits my withdrawals and talked to me about my activity and whether or not that would be a good account for me. She was not only immensely helpful, she went out of her way to explain the situation to me - which is something I've never had a bank representative do for me.",2017-09-06
985,Great Online bank with fantastic rates,29194,277,Ally Bank,42308,5,I have banked with Ally since 2012 when interest rates were very low and I was looking to maximize my earnings. Ally had 10x the savings rate of my then current bank which excited me to switch. Since switching I have been happy with their ATM fee reimbursement (since they don't have their own locations) and their expanding services. It is convenient to be able to use one service to manage my money and this has simplified my financial management. I enjoy their free check deposit function where you just take a picture of your check. I have never had a check rejected and this service has worked well.,2017-09-04
986,Great Way to Save,29187,277,Ally Bank,42301,4,"I already had a bank account with a major bank in the United States, but I had just started earning income from a side job, and I wanted an account to keep the money in that was completely separate from my main bank account. I checked a few online banks, and Ally seemed like a straightforward and trustworthy site. Plus, the 1.15% interest seemed like a nice added benefit.<br/> <br/>It was simple to open my account, but I ran into some problems when I tried to sync my Ally account with my major bank account. I'm not sure whose fault it was, but when I tried again the next day, the problem had resolved itself.<br/> <br/>Ally was a good choice for what I need if for -- a safe way to keep track of and store my money.",2017-09-03
987,Bank With Ally,29178,277,Ally Bank,42292,5,"My experience with Ally bank has been nothing but positive. I currently have my emergency fund in a high interest savings account with Ally bank. Their interest rate on basic savings accounts simply blows every brick-and-mortar bank out of the water. The mobile app is very easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. I have only called their customer service line once; but the customer service was exceptional in this one experience. Overall, I highly recommend Ally bank, especially for their high interest cash accounts.",2017-09-02
988,Banking with Ally,29173,277,Ally Bank,42286,4,"I have been banking with Ally Bank for the last few years. I have multiple savings accounts with them, each set up to have fund automatically transferred to them each month. The interface, both online and in their app, is intuitive and easy to use. I can see my balances at a glance and can easily navigate to different accounts to check them in more detail. The interest rate is much better than ones that I get at my other brick and mortar bank. While not astronomical, I at least feel that I'm losing less money to inflation than I am at my other bank. Further, I do not pay any fees to my online bank, and they allow plenty of transfers and amounts for my needs.",2017-09-02
989,Ally is my ally,29149,277,Ally Bank,42259,5,"When I started searching for a bank I had two goals in mind: My first goal was to find a bank that had a decent savings account where my money would be somewhat hedge against inflation. Most bank pay a paltry and dismal .01% interest rate for you lending them your money, quite an insult really. Ally stood out among the top banks having interest rates, even higher than some CD's. It was fortunate that my first goal tied with my second goal when I chose ally, they were pretty easy to use. Throughout setting up my account and moving my money between banks, ally made the process really easy and I felt secure while doing it as well. Even when I've had to call customer support they've made the process really painless. Overall it's been a good 2 years with ally.",2017-08-30
990,"Ally Bank: The best internet bank, hands down",29147,277,Ally Bank,42257,5,"I've been a customer for Ally Bank for about six years now. I was at first reluctant to open another bank account because I already had accounts in other popular local banks, let alone the fact that I wasn't comfortable with an idea of an internet only bank. My brother had an account with them and he approached me and said that Ally Bank offers the best services and an unmatched customer experience. The process for opening a new account is straightforward and they even offer bonus to anyone who refers up to 5 people to them. Since I was a bit dissatisfied with the services I was getting at other banks, I decided to give Ally a try by opening a checking account with them. My account is always secure and I get all important notifications. The maintenance fees are also reasonable and their customer service is excellent. I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone looking for a customer friendly and easy to access financial institution.",2017-08-29
991,Ally is amazing,29136,277,Ally Bank,42246,5,This bank blows all other banks out of the water in my opinion. Setting up your accounts is so much easier than any other bank. You do it all from your phone instead of going into a bank. I chose this bank because of convenience; it's all done through your phone. They have I think the best fees of anyone almost none! I have overdraft protection so if my checking goes over it automatically takes from my savings. The app shows you how many transactions left you have from taking money from your savings to checking before a fee would occur. They give you back any fee that was taken from any atm's at the end of the month which is amazing. To deposit money you just take a picture of the check on the app and it get's deposited the only downfall is you can not deposit cash. They have amazing customer service you call and are connected to a real person right away.,2017-08-28
992,Great Experiences aren't always Brick-and-Mortar,29132,277,Ally Bank,42242,4,"I had reached a point where I found banking to be frustrating with wait lines in the drive through teller and always having to adjust my hours around the limited hours my local bank was opened on Saturday. In a Money magazine article, I found a recommendation for Ally. I was immediately pleased with the ease of opening an account. Even more impressively was that they had ATM's that could be accessed in my area without a fee. Be SURE to check their ATM locations - you may be pleasantly surprised. My banking experience with Ally has been limited to Savings and Checking but the experience has been painless. I would rarely ever call in but once lost an Debit Card connected to my Savings and called in and received excellent service. Another call-in experience over an inquiry into the CD's was just average but nothing bad and worthwhile to think about. Most pleasant for me has been the rate of savings. While still nowhere near the level they are during the Clinton era, the APY on the Savings is currently 1.15 which is many times more than the measly 0.05 percent offered at the local bank. While I'm not a rich person, I do enjoy seeing money add to my hard-earned savings. The checking has been worthwhile as well. While I rarely ever write checks unless it is for an offering at the church, I have found they are easily cleared just as quickly as my local bank was. Overall, I'm a very happy customer and would recommend Ally to many working professionals who may not have the time during their busy workday to visit a local bank.",2017-08-28
993,High yield savings online,29124,277,Ally Bank,42234,4,"I opened a high yield savings account with Ally Bank. At the time, the annual interest rate was 1%, which was twenty times higher than my local bank's interest rate. I wanted a place to park my money where it would be safe and earn more interest. The customer service with Ally has been very good. The mobile app makes it easy to deposit checks I receive. One downside is that cash must be deposited by mail.",2017-08-27
994,Awful customer service but otherwise adequate service,29107,277,Ally Bank,42217,3,"I created an online savings account with Ally Bank to take advantage of their more favorable account interest rates compared to brick and mortar banks. The application process was significantly more onerous that it should have been; after completing the application process provided by the bank I spent several hours on the phone on hold with their customer service because of some unknown error with their system. After spending several hours on the phone, I finally managed to be elevated to a customer service agent who actually had the pertinent information about the problem, they told me they didn't know what the problem was and that I had wasted my time on the phone because the problem would need to be addressed at a later date. <br/> <br/>Over a week later I was eventually contacted by the bank, and they informed me that my account was available to use. I deposited funds, and was, if not pleased, at least content with my choice to create the account. The interest is still laughably low, but at least it's better than any brick and mortar interest rate.",2017-08-24
995,Ally Bank Savings Account,29098,277,Ally Bank,42203,5,"I have had an online savings account at Ally Bank for the last 3 years. The company is awesome and I have not ever had any problems. The type of account I have does not have any monthly fees associated with it, which I really like because it saves me money by not having to worry about keeping a minimum amount in there at all times. It also has competitive interest rates compared to my bank that I can physically go to, which is nice. The last thing I really like is that when I want money available in my checking account (at another bank), as long as I initiate the transaction early enough in the day, it's available the very next business day! Ally Bank is a very good online bank.",2017-08-23
996,The Best in Online Banking,29081,277,Ally Bank,42185,5,"First of all, I absolutely love Ally bank. Yes, I've had a few issues, mainly because of my fault, but their customer service is one of the best in the business. One incident I had was, I forgot my login to my account, so I called them to see if I could reset the password. Within five minutes, I was able to login to my account again. It's simple to receive statements online, and to transfer money around when needed to wherever I want virtually. Also, who doesn't like to deposit a check simply by taking a picture of it from your phone? Overall, I'm very satisfied with Ally Bank and have no complaints so far.",2017-08-21
997,Ally Bank Experience,28974,277,Ally Bank,41800,5,"I opened a checking and savings account with Ally before moving to another state. I did it in 3 minutes online, and it was verified, my money transferred, and ready to go in a matter of 3 days. We are now able to deposit checks simply by sending a picture of the check. I received a debit card but was having trouble getting it activated. The online support was readily available and guided me through the process in a few moments. There customer service by phone or chat line has been superb when I have had a question. I have not had any hidden or ridiculous fees, and the paper checks are free. I also receive over 1% return on my savings account, an unheard of amount compared to other banks I used in the past. I even get .1 percent return on my checking account. Ally offers a number of options on cd's and IRA's. I transferred a portion of my savings to a long-term cd and enjoy over 2% APY. The online interface is simply and easy to use. I just appreciate the no gimmick, customer service, and convenience of this bank.",2017-08-21
998,Good On-line Bank,28963,277,Ally Bank,41790,4,"I have had a total of two CD's from this bank in the past 5 years. I bought CDs from this bank because they had the highest rate when I first bought one 5 years ago, although the return on my money was still not very good. When that CD matured, I cashed it in and later bought another one because Ally Bank was still offering the best interest. I got the type of CD where you get to raise your rate once if the interest rate goes up. I have enrolled in the notification feature where they are supposed to notify me if the interest rate goes up. I don't believe I have ever been notified, and I haven't checked to make sure that the rate has not gone up. When the CDs mature and renew, you get a little bit more interest. They send me the appropriate forms for income tax every January (or maybe they just email me), so that is simple enough. I had to call their customer service once and the representative was very friendly and helpful.",2017-08-19
999,The best online bank around.,28960,277,Ally Bank,41787,5,"I have had nothing but positive experiences since I opened my Ally account 2.5 years ago. I switched from a bank that would nickel and dime me with random fees. Since joining Ally, I've made money with the great interest rates across three accounts. Their app is extremely easy to use, depositing money is quick, and I can transfer money effortlessly. If I need cash, there are multiple machines that I can withdraw from without any fees. Their online chat is a great way to speak with customer service on my own time. All of my fears about not having a physical address to visit were resolved, and I have never had a headache needing to sort out money matters. I would recommend this bank to absolutely anyone, and I am now a devoted customer of Ally.",2017-08-19
1000,Ally bank experience,28955,277,Ally Bank,41782,4,"I bank with Ally Bank. I currently have an interest checking account with them, and am quite satisfied with them. They offer a great APY, one of the highest for banks in the nation. Transfers are fairly quick, usually within a couple days at most. I use the mobile banking app to view my balance most often. While they do not have any ATMs, they pay you back the ATM fees for the first 3 withdrawals each month from other banks ATMs I believe. Also you can always just get cash back at the grocery store as well. While my balance is usually pretty low, I don't feel any less of a valued customer than probably anyone else does. They also send feee checks to use should I want to or need to, although I have not ever written a check while at my current bank thus far. They also have prompt, and polite customer service. As they don't have physical branches, this is quite necessary as you do all interactions with people who work at the bank over the phone. Overall, I believe Ally Bank is one of the best primarily online banks you could choose.",2017-08-18
1001,Nice bank,28916,277,Ally Bank,41639,5,"Ally Bank is a wonderful way to bank. It is completely online so they offer better interest yields. The wait times for service is comparable to your typical bank, if not faster, and that's only if you need to call. Usually, I can do everything through their app or through my computer. The checking account and savings account have no monthly fees so I don't feel like I'm having money taken out for no reason. I would highly recommend them and have many times.",2017-08-18

I thought that they weren't necessary anymore, and so I looked into online banks, and chose the one I heard was best, which was Ally. I was right, you don't need a bank with physical locations, and Ally turned out to be the best bank I've ever used. It has a checking account with no minimum amount, and no fees. The interest rate is fine, and everything about the experience is smooth and easy, from depositing checks (using your smartphone), to paying bills, to using ATMs (the app shows you which in your area are free), to transferring money digitally. It's all there, and I have absolutely no reason to switch back to a ""normal"" bank. Oh, and their customer service is quick and painless, 24/7. Ally has really impressed me.",2017-08-18
1003,ALLY BANK-THE WAY TO GROW YOUR SAVINGS,28907,277,Ally Bank,41630,4,"My mom started this savings bank account for me when I was 17. She wanted me to be a good saver and she thought this online bank would be the best way for me to do that. She started it out with $500. So then when I would get paid at my job I would automatically have $50 withdrawn from my checking and put into my Ally savings, which I still do today. The money in that account has grown beyond my wildest belief and I just keep adding to it. I think the 1.15% interest rate is the best out there. I really have no complaints with this bank.<br/>Since I have never had to use their customer service but once, all I can say is that one time was a good experienced. I got help with what I needed and I did not have any problems. I never have any issues, except for that one time, with this bank. I just let my money grow. If I do need to use some for some reason, I have no problem getting to the money in my account. I absolutely love this bank and I am really glad my mom opened it for me. If you want to save and watch your money grow, then this is the bank for you.",2017-08-17
1004,My Ally Experience,28905,277,Ally Bank,41628,4,"A couple of years ago a friend of mine gave me some advice. He said it would be a good idea to open a secondary bank account for emergencies. Something separate from the everyday accounts so that there wouldn't be a temptation to spend the money. I decided to open an account with Ally because it offered a high interest rate on its savings accounts and being online made it easy to sign up. In fact, signing up was a breeze. I filled out the form, transferred some money from my regular savings account and I was all set. <br/> <br/>For the most part I am happy with the bank. I don't use the account very often as it is only for emergencies but I am happy with the interest I am earning on what is essentially 'banked' money. Also, the website is very easy to navigate, functions well, and I am confident if I had a problem they would address it quickly and efficiently. I will say withdrawing money from the account on the few occasions that I have the ATM fees were rather high, but I guess that is the tradeoff.",2017-08-17
1005,"Overall, a great choice",28903,277,Ally Bank,41626,4,"I've had checking and savings with Ally for approximately two years, and overall I've had a great experience and would recommend them to anyone. Some of the things I enjoy about Ally are the competitive interest rates. My savings account earns 1.15% while I get a little interest with the checking account as well. The bank is easy to use, and has a full mobile platform that allows me to transfer money, deposit checks from my phone, and pay bills using their app. I also get free checks for the rare occasions that I write a check. I've only had to reorder checks once, but when I did they were free to reorder. There are a few cons with Ally. First, it seems their mobile site/app is always undergoing maintenance. Not a big deal, but there have been a handful of times when I wanted to check my balance and it wasn't available. They also don't allow you to cash checks made out to a different person. For example, for Christmas my daughter gets a check made into her name. I used to cash it into my account no problem with Wells Fargo. From there I would transfer it to her savings account. But with Ally, they wouldn't let me cash it into my account, they said the only way they could cash it is if I opened a checking account for her. So that was a little frustrating, but not a deal breaker. Overall though, I've been very pleased and will continue to bank with them for a long time.",2017-08-17
1006,Ally Bank - One of the Best Banks,28864,277,Ally Bank,41555,4,"I have used Ally Bank for approximately half a year now. I love it. I used to use Citibank and HSBC, but after reading online about all these things I could be doing with my money, I read up on ally bank and felt like their products would produce so much more results for me in the long run. Their interest rate to this date is about 1.10%, compared to Citibank's .5% or so. That is an incredible difference. I have loved every aspect of online banking with Ally, and I love having all of my details and accounts at the palm of my hand. Everything is easily accessible, and you can transfer funds to and from your other banks with no additional fees. I really could not speak more highly of Ally.",2017-08-14
1007,Ally Bank is incredible,28839,277,Ally Bank,41504,5,"I got a checking and savings account through Ally approximately two years ago. In that time, I have had to use ATMs at different banks, contact customer service quite a few times, and ask for a refund of a fee that hit my account. Ally repays $10 of ATM fees per month at the end of that month. They usually have a 2 minute wait time on customer service calls, and I have always felt welcomed and like my concerns were legitimate. They even took a $25 overdraft fee off my account once because I had money transferred in the same day. I have had similar experiences with other banks, and none were as pleasant (excessive wait time, refunding half a fee). In addition, Ally offers the most competitive interest rates on the market for both checking and savings, and does not charge fees for simply having accounts.",2017-08-13
1008,Ally Bank,28833,277,Ally Bank,41498,4,"I have been banking with Ally Bank for quite some time now. I have never had a problem with them. They make it easy for you to make deposits into your account, and transfer money in between accounts if necessary. They are wonderful when it comes to ATM's and their reimbursement of any fees associated with using those ATM's. I am very pleased with the service and quality of my banking accounts. I highly recommend this bank.",2017-08-12
1009,Extremely Great Online Option,28824,277,Ally Bank,41489,5,"I originally looked on the internet in order to find an online banking account. From my research, I decided All Bank was the best for me. I have a checking and a savings account with them and I am very pleased. I have already recommended this bank to a lot of other people. They have ATM refunds so you can use any ATM near you. It is not a problem that they don't have any physical locations because you can take care of all your business online. I love using this bank and I will continue using this bank for a long time. I will also be using them for other banking services shortly. This is an excellent online option.",2017-08-11
1010,Wonderfully easy and convenient,28819,277,Ally Bank,41484,4,"I opened both checking and savings accounts with Ally Bank about a year ago. The whole process was very easy. After verifying my information and linking a bank account, my account was live and functioning within two days. I've been depositing every month via their eDeposit through their app. I've also had to call their customer service a few times, and I did not experience any difficulties or long wait times. <br/> <br/>I've been so happy with them, in fact, I decided to open up an investment account through them. Transferring money from my savings account is quick and painless. The money is available to be invested in one business day.<br/> <br/>All and all, I very much recommend Ally Bank. They have competitive rates, quality customer service and a user friendly platform.",2017-08-11
1011,Online Banking At Its Best,28814,277,Ally Bank,41480,5,"I chose to check out Ally because I needed a second account to process specific money paid to my children for child support. I ended up switching my account with another bank out for this one because I was so impressed. Ally is known for having a great interest rate return in checking, but they surpass this in almost every other detail. Not only does Ally have a great system to refund money for ATM fees, they process the reimbursements quickly. Another thing that I really like about this banking system is their stellar customer service. I recently had to deal with a full identity theft, and they sent me an email immediately following the breech and went above and beyond to help ensure my security. They really made me feel as though I was a top priority and took steps beyond what they were responsible for to help me get all of my non-Ally accounts secure. The customer service rep even checked on me several times over the course of a few weeks to make sure my security was still intact. The one issue I have with Ally is that I find transfers and deposits, aside from direct deposits of my payroll check, do seem to take a little longer to process. I still use my second checking account just to deal with this issue because I think that 4-5 days is a bit much to wait for funds to be available for a check deposit.",2017-08-10
1012,No Fees and High Interest Rates,28807,277,Ally Bank,41473,5,"Ally Bank is the best bank with which I have ever done business. They have extremely high interest rates in their savings accounts and certificates of deposits and their mobile app is extremely intuitive and user-friendly. Their customer service representatives are always knowledgeable and quick to find the correct and accurate answer to their customers' questions. Customer service almost never has a hold over a couple of minutes on the phone and one can connect to a real individual virtually instantly via the convenient chat option. The mobile app and the online banking show live, accurate wait-times for phone call queries. If you are the type who would rather figure things out on your own, Ally's FAQ on their website is exhaustive and all documents you might need are available there. The online banking allows you to make any and all changes you may need to on your account if you'd rather not talk to a person via chat or phone and have them do it for you.",2017-08-10
1013,Great rates and great service,28770,277,Ally Bank,41336,5,"I've been with Ally for over a year now as my primary personal savings account and I have been thrilled with everything so far. They have some of the highest interest rates in the industry and their web and mobile banking platforms are seamless. They are very simple to navigate and intuitive in terms of the placement of the menu, etc. The interest rates and mobile platform are great, but the customer service at Ally is probably their biggest selling point. They are extremely responsive to customer needs and provide resolutions very quickly! The ease of use and ability to transfer directly to/from my checking account and another one of my accounts I receive payments through makes this a great choice for me. Not having a physical location doesn't affect me since everything is made so convenient online or in the mobile app.",2017-08-09
1014,Ally Bank exceeds most other banks in almost every way,28764,277,Ally Bank,41330,4,"At the suggestion of a relative, I opened an Ally savings account a few years ago or so and have had nothing but positive experiences since. I deposit all of my money into my Ally account when I can help it because its interest rate is far and away the best among the several banks I use (and have used). I've also seen the interest rate go up several times over the years, including just within the last month. I had a savings account with another bank for a while, simply because I had a checking account with that same bank, which I closed after discovering that I had made two cents in interest for the entire year. Ally Bank offered (at the time) an interest rate that was 25 times higher than that bank offered. Anytime I transfer money to and from my Ally account, it goes through quickly and without a hitch, and I really couldn't be more satisfied. My only complaint is that, because it's an online-only bank, I have to use other means to deposit cash.",2017-08-09
1015,Nice for CDs,28753,277,Ally Bank,41319,4,"I have used Ally Bank twice in regards to opening and holding a CD of more than $10,000 each CD. These were short-term CDs with a low interest rate and I used Ally Bank as a service to hold my money in-between other investment opportunities. The customer service I received was acceptable however I wished the investment staff was a little more knowledgable. They knew the ins and outs of their own systems well and I had no trouble opening or closing out the CDs. However, when I attempted to chit-chat with the staff regarding other, more promising investment opportunities within the bank, they were very unhelpful due to lack of knowledge. I have used their website a few times just to check on my accounts and have never had any issues logging in. The investment turn around on the CDs was very minimal and I had to open a checking account in order to open the CDs, but there were no fees involved so I didn't mind following their rules. I still maintain the checking account I opened with Ally Bank and use it as a backup checking account. I have never insured any mysterious fees with Ally Bank like I have with some other banks, so I appreciate their due diligence with keeping on top of their institution's record keeping. I believe Ally Bank is more often used by individuals who require loans, so perhaps that is why they are not more aggressive with securing better interest rates on CD investments. I will continue to hold a secondary account with them for the time being for possible future investments.",2017-08-07
1016,A great bank,28730,277,Ally Bank,41287,5,"I have been a customer of Ally Bank for almost 20 years. I have an online checking account and have been extremely pleased. Ally consistently has one of the highest interest rates among most banks. The customer service is very friendly and helpful. I have called them several times over the many years for various questions: how to access account, resetting passwords, moving, etc. They know the answers without having to transfer me to other people or give a vague answer. I can easily transfer money from that account to any of my other accounts, deposit into my account or simply withdrawal money from my account. I have an automatic deposit set up with Ally each paycheck and love watching my money grow. They have no fees and some accounts do not need a minimum deposit. I would be hard pressed to find a better bank.",2017-08-06
1017,"Great Bank, But Have a Backup",28723,277,Ally Bank,41277,4,"I have a checking account with Ally. Overall, my experience has been great. I've never had any fees from them, and not only do they not charge to use an ATM, they refund your ATM fees. When I started with Ally the ATM refunds were unlimited and now there's a cap at I think $10, but that's still pretty sweet since I rarely reach that cap. I deposit checks using their app, and it can take me a couple tries to get the picture right but I've never had a problem with deposits. I have had my account information stolen a couple times (which I don't think is on them, it can happen anywhere) and their customer service for that wasn't great. The first time I found out that my card had been frozen by trying to use it, couldn't use the ATM either, and found out what happened by calling them. They made no attempt to contact me first, and then I couldn't access my money (except by using checks) for a couple weeks because they took that long to get me a new card. That's why I recommend a backup bank if you're using Ally. However, besides that experience they've been pretty great.",2017-08-05
1018,Amazing Customer Service.,28719,277,Ally Bank,41272,5,"Ally bank has been a godsend in the banking world for me. At first I was hesitant to move to an all online bank, but Ally took that fear away very quickly. My first experience in their amazing customer service was only about a week after opening the account, when I had a check to mobile deposit, and the app was having issues accepting it, when i called and explained the issue to the individual on the other line, they took the check information right there and it was deposited within 24 hours, no issues. A few years later, I had my debt card stolen and roughly $3000 in fraudulent charges placed on it, when i called them up they were more than accommodating and I had the money back with in a week! I cannot express enough graciousness for the wonderful experiences I have had with this banking Institution, they absolutely have a customer for life.",2017-08-05
1019,Easy way to get my home loan,28712,277,Ally Bank,41265,5,I opened up a checking and savings accounts in Ally Bank five years ago. I wanted to start saving to buy a house. I have been a renter ever since I was an adult of 18 and I was tired of just paying rent and not owning anything in the end. But I knew I needed to start saving money. I went into a Ally Bank branch and talked to a customer service representative. I opened up a savings and checking account that day. I felt I was on my way to becoming a home owner. Then six months ago I went back to Ally Bank and they walked me through the procedure of getting my loan. It was easier than I thought it would be because they had told me how to get there. I love living in my home. Thanks to Ally Bank.,2017-08-04
1020,Banking online with Ally,28703,277,Ally Bank,41256,5,"I have always banked at a physical brick and mortar bank. It's something I was used to and wanted to continue. I started seeing different advertising on other banking institutions that were mostly online. Of course I was skeptical but began to look into them. I visited web sites and read countless reviews until I hit on one that I decided to give try. I tried Ally Bank. The first change I made was switching my savings account over from the bank I'd been using for years. The rates were extremely competitive and I,found the customer service help,I,received was outstanding. I was very happy with the whole process and I decided to look into personal checking accounts. Again I was surprised at the competitive rates and fees associated with personal checking accounts. I am now doing all of my personal banking with Ally Bank. I am now looking into CDs and college funds for my grandchildren. I couldn't be happier with Ally Bank and I highly recommend them.",2017-08-03
1021,Ally Bank is great!,28692,277,Ally Bank,41245,4,"I really enjoy banking with Ally. They have a great online user experience and an easy to use mobile application. The customer service has been amazing when I needed some questions answered and you are usually able to start an online chat if you can't call in. I currently have a checking and savings account through Ally, which both earn better interest rates than my old brick and mortar bank. I earn 0.1% APY on the checking account and 1.15% APY on the savings account. Another cool feature is that I can create sub accounts in my savings account. However, there are some cons to online banking with Ally. As it is only and online bank, it is not possible to deposit cash. Additionally, transferring money in and out of the account can take some time. It is usually 3 days before I can see the money in my account. Overall, I'm pleased with Ally and enjoy banking with them more than my old bank.",2017-08-02
1022,Ally Is Great For Banking,28688,277,Ally Bank,41241,5,"I have been using Ally Bank for years now. Anytime I have questions about my account the customer service agents are very pleasant and helpful. They do not have a brick and mortar location. This might be a negative for some who like going in person for their banking needs. For me, I do not mind that at all. I have never had issues calling customer service. They were prompt in sending me my banking card. The app is easy to navigate. I like the convenience of having the app on my phone. I get to see all of my account activity on the go. The website is also very easy to use. The interface is easy to navigate. I enjoy using Ally as my bank.",2017-08-02
1023,Great rates for an online savings account.,28397,277,Ally Bank,40276,4,"I would say I have had a very positive experience with ally.com. I opened a savings account with them about a year ago. The application process was easy and fast. I haven't really had any customer service issues, but if I did I feel pretty confident they would be resolved in a timely and professional manner. The rate of return for online savings accounts with ally is 1.05%, which far exceeded that of my other bank. This was my main reason for opening an account with ally. I have been happy with the process of transfers between my bank and ally.com. Overall, I would recommend this bank to a friend.",2017-07-31
1024,Happy to be banking with Ally,28374,277,Ally Bank,40222,5,"I started banking with Ally a short time ago (maybe a year ago give or take some time) and I have absolutely no complaints service wise, I only have savings and a money market account with them but i honestly couldn't be happier, the interest rate is so much higher compared to the brick & mortar local bank that I still use for checking, so I feel it makes my money work for me, even if it's just a few extra dollars a month. (My local banks savings accounts only offer 0.05% interest whereas ally offers 1.05% on savings accounts and .85% on money market accounts)<br/>The only problem I have with Ally is that if I didn't have a local physical bank I'd have to write checks and mail them to make a deposit. I have not yet actually had to deal with their customer service as I haven't had anything come up that would warrant an interaction",2017-07-31
1025,A great place to online bank,28366,277,Ally Bank,40213,4,I was a little hesitant to initially open an account with an online institution. My husband was the one who opened an account first. I thought it would turn out to be really terrible and difficult since there is no branch to go to when you have problems. However it turned out to be incredibly simple and I love the high interest rate on our savings account. We love it so much that we've opened a few different savings accounts. Their mobile application also makes it super easy to view and manage all your accounts from your home page. I would ever go back to a traditional savings account.,2017-07-30
1026,Ally Bank is good for savings,28893,277,Ally Bank,41616,4,"I have had an Ally Bank savings account for a little over a year. The savings rate is not that high, but it is an easy way for me to set aside money and I really enjoy the online only part of the account. I don't receive any paper mess with this account, and i can easily transfer money in and out of it. I have had to contact customer support to reset my password, and they were very helpful in getting that accomplished. I was impressed with the security of the conversation as well, in how I had to answer all of the pre-setup security questions. I plan to continue using Ally Bank as my secondary savings account and may even look to utilize some of their other services in the future.",2017-07-28
1027,Easy to use,28350,277,Ally Bank,40197,5,"I signed up for Ally Bank about a year ago. The reason I came across Ally Bank was due to the ease of use while only being available online. I use Ally Bank online as a savings account for smaller earnings that I accrue throughout the month. The interest rate with Ally Bank's savings accounts are competitive. The interest rates are not the best that are available online, but I have found that I only qualify for particular online banks. My credit is not the best and many online-only banks had to run my credit before accepting me. With Ally Bank, I was able to set up the account immediately and begin depositing the next day. I really appreciate the ease of use with Ally Bank and it has not been a problem thus far. I will continue to use them because I have not encountered any problems technically, or with customer service.",2017-07-27
1028,Great experience,28804,277,Ally Bank,41470,5,"I chose to open an account at Ally Bank last month (June) because their CD interest rates were much better than my brick and mortar bank. The online application was fast and simple to open a savings account and CD. Ally's savings account interest rate is also more than my ""regular"" bank. It takes a little longer than normal (imo) to transfer funds to Ally from my brick and mortar bank, but I don't really care. My accounts were open and funded within a 3-4 day period. I also opened a savings account for my son since Ally makes it so simple. I plan to open an investment account there as well. I don't care that Ally is an ""online only"" bank; their interest rates definitely make a difference. Their website is easy to navigate, looks nice, and has lots of helpful information. They also have customer service numbers and chat available, but so far I haven't needed either one. The steps to open accounts are very easy to follow and I like I can make transactions at any time of day.",2017-07-26

Everywhere I was looking the minimum amount to start an IRA was 500.00 I ran across Ally banks' website. I was surprised to learn there was no minimum. I even found a section on the website that explained each type of account, the fees, and a compare option between accounts. It was very easy to learn about, set up and feel confident that I made the right choice. I also took of advantage of the budgeting courses and I learned so much more than I could ever imagine. I will go to Ally bank for any of my other needs in the future.",2017-07-25
1030,Online Banking You Can Trust,28325,277,Ally Bank,40171,5,"I am a relatively new customer of Ally, but was drawn to their high-yield savings and high-yield 12-month CD that is not rivaled by any other online banking service. I feel that online-only banking is becoming popular in the digital age, and Ally is securing their spot as the most transparent and fruitful service among the rest. I have a 1.05% savings fund with Ally, significantly greater than the 0.03% I was receiving from a big institution. Additionally, their 1.35% CD cannot be matched. The mobile app is smooth and uses fingerprint technology that makes me feel that my funds are secure. I expect to stay with Ally for all future savings/CD funds, and possibly moving my checking account to one of their 0.10% APY services.",2017-07-21
1031,Know What You Want,28675,277,Ally Bank,27795,2,"Ally bank is fine for direct deposit banking only. For the Almost 2 years I have had my account HOLD every check I make by mobile deposit is held for 10 days. Then I am charged $25.00 over draft fee, due to them holding my paychecks. This is not the first paycheck but the check from the one employer has been over a year. They are not greatest bank ever. More like better than some. This bank account gives you a little interest other than that is is the same as buying a prepaid credit card.<br/>It took a year for me to be able to use my card and check my information online and I have 3 degree's in computers.",2017-07-19
1032,"Great Rates, But Costly Lessons Learned",28674,277,Ally Bank,31150,4,"Ally's ""no-penalty 11-month CD"" motivated me to be a customer and I like their 24/7 live customer service. However, some of their agents, including technical team members are still providing erroneous information. Some other hard lessons I learned:<br/><br/>- Customers cannot set up ""custom"" alerts on CDs in spite of what multiple agents claimed.<br/>- Customers must open a second Ally account and keep it active in order to qualify for speedier disbursement of funds via wire transfer or ACH.<br/>- CDs can only be funded one time. I was initially informed that CDs can be funded from multiple external accounts within the 30-day window. In reality, funding a CD from numerous sources must be deposited in a separate Ally account then transferred to the new CD in a single transaction. (Again, a separate Ally account must be opened.)<br/>- There are periods when funds do not earn any interest.<br/>- I noticed that when I agree to complete a customer satisfaction survey prior to being transferred to an agent, and subsequently the agent was not able to answer my question or resolve my issue, I am disconnected and unable to complete the survey. Subsequently, I learned that bonuses are awarded each month to agents based on their survey evaluations; the latter also impact their performance reviews.",2017-07-19
1033,Awesome online banking services with great interest rates for savings account,28318,277,Ally Bank,40164,4,I have a savings account with ALLY Bank and I like how competitive their rates are. They make sure their clients will always get the best interest rates to maximize our profits. They also perform one day bank transfers to other bank accounts outside of ALLY. There are NO fees for these transactions! I have never had any issues with this bank. The only time I had to contact them was when I forgot my log-in and the customer service rep was extremely nice and professional.,2017-07-19
1034,Others Should Learn From Ally,28668,277,Ally Bank,40250,5,"Working with Ally is almost always easy. The web interface allows me to do pretty much everything I need to do with no hassle and no waiting. Opening new CDs and closing existing ones is a breeze.<br/><br/>The checking and savings rates are generally quite competitive. The 11 month no penalty CD has a rate above the savings rate often enough that I find I keep very little in savings. When the no penalty rate increased, I was able to close one CD and open its replacement in less time than I've spent writing this review. To my great pleasure, the CD rate went up again a few days after I opened a CD and it automatically updated to the new rate. Had it not, it would have only cost me a couple minutes to fix it.<br/><br/>When I've needed to talk with a CSR, they've been available with a very short wait and generally quite able to help. The one thing that is troublesome for them is figuring out how to order duplicate (carbon copy) checks. Luckily I don't use too many of them so I don't have to suffer through this too often.<br/><br/>The ATM card allows alerts. I generally don't use it, so I want to be alerted of its use. At the one place that I do use it, I find that my phone is alerting me of the purchase before the receipt finishes printing. I have made a couple international trips. In the UK I tried to use an Allpoint ATM and my transaction was denied. I don't know whose fault that was and it really wasn't a big deal. In Spain I didn't bother hunting for an Allpoint ATM and was able to withdraw without hassle with a 1% exchange fee.",2017-07-18

My last Internet only bank was Ing, which I liked but if was lacking. Now with improved technology and faster internet connections, Ally Bank provides everything I need. Calling is great, and if I choose to chat then that is also a great way to get great customer service. Transfers don't take weeks like it's use to with Ing and there are a lot of banks of on their network that don't charge a fee for ATM use. I love them, and now that I paid off my car with Wells Fargo I can cut the cord completely.",2017-07-17

I like to use a credit union for loans and online banks for deposits. Ally had the best rates at the time and I had heard of them because I live in Detroit. Setting up the account was very easy and hassle free and I LOVE their online wait timer for customer service reps via telephone(although it was sometimes a little generous). They also didn't hold deposits as long as some banks I had used in the past. The website was my only hangup, it was difficult to find the routing number but a bit too easy to find my account number, although that may be my paranoia at it getting compromised.",2017-07-17

I was accepted for a new account within minutes of my application. I was able to join with my initial deposit of $50. I found their login process and account screen very easy to use and interpret. Once my total balance equaled $100, I immediately began receiving an interest rate of 1.05%. Interest is compounded daily, and deposited in your account monthly. I also was happy with the fact that you can transfer amounts from your Ally account to another bank account up to six times per statement period. It takes a few days for transfers to go through. Overall, I am satisfied with Ally as a convenient Online Banking solution.",2017-07-14

I have a savings account and the interest rate is one of the best available when you have a small balance. Setting up the account was very easy. I was able to make a deposit directly from funds in another bank account and the whole process only took a couple of days. While I primarily just add funds through direct deposit (this is intended to be an emergency savings account), I like that I can deposit checks with my phone. I didn't qualify for a checking account, due my credit rating. This makes it difficult because I can only access my money through a wire transfer to another account, which costs me $20 and can take one business day. I would like to have faster access to my cash with no fees.",2017-07-13
1039,My Awesome Online Bank,28267,277,Ally Bank,40058,4,I have been banking with Ally Bank for five years now and I love it. This bank is the true definition of online banking which values customer service. The bank has no physical establishment where I can go to inquire something but they have an excellent online platform which caters to all my needs. Once I had to travel to Africa and I needed some emergency money while there. I went to an ATM and to my surprise I could withdraw money. This was amazing and I was really happy. Whenever I have problems with my debit card I can just call customer service and they are happy to help me. This bank is always prompt in renewing my debit cards before they expire. I love the efficiency of this bank and I would not trade it for anything else.,2017-07-13

Fairly easy to work around but still.<br/><br/>And, like most places, they can be down in the wee hours.<br/><br/>Limit of 6 transfer outs per savings account but you can have lots of savings accounts. There is a fee if you go over 6. They waived my first & only one.",2017-07-12
1041,Solid Performer,28256,277,Ally Bank,40046,3,"I have been a member/user of Ally for about 5 years now and have never had a real issue with them. Initially I was attracted by their good rates on CD's however over time I have become less and less impressed with them in that regard. That said I have never had a bad experience with them and when I have needed assistance their technical support and account folks have been very helpful. I have moved all my banking over to them from one of the big banks and have never regretted it. Managing my accounts has been easy, finding competetive products that meet my investment goals are easily available. All in all I am a satisfied customer who is pleased with the product offerings and would encourage people to check it out",2017-07-11
1042,Best online bank around,28249,277,Ally Bank,40039,5,"1.05% interest on savings accounts should say it all! Some banks offer higher interest but you have to jump through many hoops. At Ally you don't need to do anything. No minimum amounts, No amount of purchases needed per month. .10% on checking is one of the best around as well. And $10 monthly on ATM fees is a great plus as well if you cant find a free ATM. They do have 43,000 free ATMs across the country. Customer service is also top notch, any time I had a question or concern, they were able to take care of me. Stress free.",2017-07-08
1043,Customer Service? Good luck...,28243,277,Ally Bank,40034,3,"After many years of banking with traditional banks, I decided to try an online bank hoping to save some cash. I admit I probably didn't do much research, but I decided to open an account with Ally. On one hand, while I Was able to accomplish saving money on fees (the fees at my regular brick and mortar bank are insane), I actually am not sure it was worth it. The customer service at Ally leaves much to be desired. For an online bank, this is terrible because you have to rely on the customer service on the internet or the phone. If you have a problem with your regular bank, you can just visit a branch and they're usually able to help. All in all, Ally is only good until you have an issue. If you have an issue, you're absolutely in a mess.",2017-07-06
1044,"Ally is my first online bank, and the only one I'll ever need",28132,277,Ally Bank,39664,5,"I was worried at first about using an online bank because I didn't know if they were trustworthy. Reading reviews for Ally put my mind at ease about that, and so I decided to try them out. They have a free checking account with no minimum balance, so it seemed easy enough. And it was. I signed up and deposited my money via the extremely easy to use check scanning with their mobile app, and I've been using them ever since. Connecting other sites and services to my Ally account was easy too, which is a huge plus, because I hate having to input routing numbers and account numbers every time I want to interface with another site. With Ally I just have to log in with my username and password and I'm good to go. And their mobile app is really secure too, with a fingerprint option so that nobody can get into the app but me. Their customer service has been amazing, with both chat and phone available, and I've used both with no problems. I definitely don't regret using Ally.",2017-07-03
1045,Easy And No Problems,28549,277,Ally Bank,40747,5,"I have a savings account, Roth IRA, a couple of CD's and an investment account originally opened through TradeKing.

1046,"Phenomenal Bank, No Complaints",28530,277,Ally Bank,40689,5,"If you're okay with not having an in-person bank, you will not be disappointed with Ally.

1047,Unfriendly With Your IRA Direct Transfers To Other Banks,28519,277,Ally Bank,39115,1,"Fantastic and easy to use on-line banking website to open and close accounts, chat with customer service people, etc. HOWEVER, beware that it can be very difficult and cumbersome when it comes to getting Ally Bank to process your IRA Direct Transfer Request to move your IRA funds to another bank or CU to take advantage of better CD rates. For example, Ally Bank REFUSES to accept from the sending bank an IRA Direct Transfer Request in DocuSign form with a electronic signature by the IRA account owner. They require a handwritten signature from the IRA account owner.",2017-06-28
1048,Great Bank,28515,277,Ally Bank,40649,5,The people at Ally have always been very helpful and very knowledgeable. We've been banking there for several years and have NEVER had a bad experience with them.,2017-06-28
1049,Great Experience!,28080,277,Ally Bank,39587,4,I have had a great experience banking with Ally. I was at first hesitant at using an online bank that I could not track down if something went wrong but banking with Ally I found a ton of positive reviews and that really helped comfort me. The experience I have had has been solid as I use it to store some extra cash in my savings account that I am saving up for a trip. I don't have to look at the amount and just have to wire the money there every month and the rest is taken care of. If I login to my account I can check my balance and do everything that you would be able to do at a bank. I love using Ally.com.,2017-06-24
1050,Ally Experience,27959,277,Ally Bank,39329,5,"My wife and I have been banking with Ally Bank for 4 years now. It was a little intimidating when we first made the switch because there is no physical bank, but it has never been a problem for us. Anytime we need cash, we can use any ATM and the fees are refunded to us each month, which is a plus. Also, checks are free to order. Ally's Bill Pay system is also very easy to use and is very clear about when the payment will be made so that there is no confusion or late bills! Anytime that we have needed to call Ally's customer service the wait has been under 3 minutes and the representatives are always very kind and helpful! Whenever we have a check to deposit it is very easy to just simply take a picture of the check and the bank deposits it for you. Very simple and efficient without the hassle of having to go to a physical bank!",2017-06-19
1051,Ally Bank Online Savings Account,27946,277,Ally Bank,39315,4,"I have an online savings account at Ally. They are an online-only bank so it is perfect for me as I do not have to be near a physical branch. The 1% APY is one of the largest interest rates you can earn on a savings account, especially compared to my home bank where I have other checking and savings accounts. The customer service is highly responsive due to its nature as online-only and their mobile banking is easy to use. I do about 95% of my banking on the Ally app and the other 5% on my laptop computer on a web browser. I rarely need to access my savings account, but I like how Ally is accessible everywhere on all my devices and earns a fair amount in this current rates market.",2017-06-16
1052,Savings Account,27937,277,Ally Bank,39304,5,"A couple weeks ago,I made a deposit to my savings account. The deposit was somewhat large and important. A couple days later, I checked to see if my deposit was cleared and in my savings account. The deposit was not there yet so I called an Ally customer representative to see what the problem with my deposit was. The representative was very helpful and respectful. I was having a bad week so I was not very respectful and was a bit rude with her. She looked up into my account and noticed that I had typed my account number wrong. We went through every step and gave her my correct account information. Two days later the amount I deposited was sitting in my savings account. I have been a customer with Ally for two years now and all that I can say is that they have the best customer service I have had to deal with. I really recommend Ally bank to everyone.",2017-06-15
1053,Positive experience banking with Ally,27922,277,Ally Bank,39282,5,"I have been a banking customer with Ally for about 6 years. The customer service has been great and the representatives are always very friendly and helpful. I like the ability to chat and email a bank rather than sit on a phone and be on hold. Emails are responded to within a matter of hours and chat features are always answered real-time. I had reservations about using an online-only bank; however, Ally made the process very simple and easy to use. I am able to check my accounts very easily, make electronic deposits, and they partner with traditional banks to withdraw funds. I also took out a couple CD's electronically and it was also very easy to do. The most unique thing for me was using the electronic signature feature, but that was also very simple and straightforward. I recommend others use online banks too for their ease-of-use and lower fees than what you get at traditional banks. Loans have lower interest rates and savings accounts pay a higher interest rate. There really isn't anything they cant do at Ally that they can at a physical branch. It is amazing how everything can be done electronically.",2017-06-13
1054,Great!! (for the most part),27903,277,Ally Bank,39263,4,"Ally Bank was a breath of fresh air for me. I was tired of getting run around and hassled by the brick and mortar financial institutions and ultimately ending up with something I did not really want or prefer. Ally Bank's investment rates were so significantly better than the traditional banks' rates that it was not even funny. I also had no problem at all setting up checking and savings accounts. <br/>But, and this is a big but, there is something to be said for having a bank you can walk up to. Shortly after opening my account with Ally, my identity was stolen and I had to spend a great deal of time and effort getting that problem rectified. My data breach had nothing whatsoever to do with Ally but the simple act of physically talking face-to-face with a financial representative would have been more reassuring and Ally could not provide that.",2017-06-08
1055,I really feel like they are my Ally.,27843,277,Ally Bank,39158,5,"I have had a checking account with Ally Bank for several years now. I initially signed up because fees with my previous brick-and-mortar bank were getting out of hand, and I have not regretted it once. Not only do they not have any monthly or annual fees for having my account, they actually pay me a small amount of interest. It doesn't add up to much, but it's good for today's rates. I was concerned about the possible difficulty of accessing cash without any physical locations, but Ally does not charge any fees to use an ATM, and additionally will automatically reimburse the fees charged by ATM operators up to a few dollars. Their overdraft policy is also unusually generous, and they offer some other great perks. I couldn't be happier with this service and can't see ever switching back as long as they keep it up.",2017-05-30
1056,Great Online Bank,27828,277,Ally Bank,39142,5,I believe that Ally Bank is the best online bank ever created. This bank has great customer service and it continues to be there for what I need. This bank is always quick to respond to all of my needs. Ally also has low fees and they transfer funds between my other bank accounts very quickly. I've been with them for about 2 years now and I have loved every minute of it. I was sick and tired of the delay and poor customer service of the big banks like Bank of America and BB&T so I decided to switch.,2017-05-25
1057,Great rates and easy to use,27752,277,Ally Bank,38996,4,"I have a savings as well as checking account with Ally. They have some of the best rates available on the market. Transferring money into and out of the accounts has never been an issue. The only thing I miss is an ATM presence but they do allow you to go to any ATM machine and the fees you incur will be refunded at the end of the month. The mobile application is very intuitive and easy to use, never had any crashes of problems logging in. When I did have an issue, there is a timer that shows the average wait time, the representative that answered my call was courteous and provided me with the information I needed. Thanks again for a great product/service.",2017-05-17
1058,Safe and Affordable,27742,277,Ally Bank,38986,5,"I switched to Ally mostly to lower my fees and try to earn a little better interest rate on my money. The experience has been nothing but positive. I have avoided many of the fees that my traditional bank required. They are good about reimbursing transaction fees if you use an atm out of their network. Also, I was given checks completely free, compared to my old bank where I had to buy them. Their online banking system is very user friendly. It is easy to transfer funds to other accounts online. I was nervous at first to try an online bank, but I am really glad that I gave Ally a try.",2017-05-15
1059,Best online bank I've ever used!,27731,277,Ally Bank,38973,5,"I've not run into any problems from Ally. Their customer service is amazing. And their ATM fees are non existent, they will actually pay me back at the end of each month up to 10 dollars for ATM fees if I was unable to use their recommended ATM. But they do have a certain ATM that is abundant all over america that won't charge Ally customers any money for use of their ATM. So they've been great, I'm so glad I decided to give them a try! I would personally highly recommend anybody who's wanting to save money, especially if they don't have to use a branch location.",2017-05-11
1060,Ally banking - great customer service and low fees!,27685,277,Ally Bank,38888,5,"I use Ally's online banking services. I have been using it now for a little over a year. During that time I have been quite impressed by the services I have received. On several occasions, I had to contact the bank's customer service via telephone. I was very impressed by a couple factors - first, the wait was very short - I've never had to wait more than a couple minutes to speak with someone. Also, I've always spoken to a live representative who was very friendly, quick, and thorough in assisting me. Also, I have an app on my phone that allows me to access my services. The app is well laid out and is easy to use and understand. The website is much like the app, and is quick and easy to understand. I also feel that the information I give on the website and app are secure. I would highly recommend this bank to anyone who is looking for an online solution to their banking needs.",2017-05-05
1061,A Good Bank to get Started,27683,277,Ally Bank,38886,5,"I originally joined Ally because of their no minimums and no monthly upkeep fees. However, I have grown to love it. I have gone from a basic interest checking account to also include savings and an IRA. The setup was simple but thorough, and transfers between accounts are instant. I even got some free checks and a no-monthly fee debit card in the process.<br/> <br/>Deposits have been simple. Checks have a 'take a picture' feature, and it is very paypal friendly for electronic deposits. Being I never deposit cash, this system works great for me (though there are instructions on how to do so if needed). <br/> <br/>Customer service is amazing, too. My longest wait time ever was about two minutes, and they are very customer friendly. One time an online shop decided to use my debit card on file to pay a subscription and it threw my account into a negative despite the fact the deposit was already processing beforehand. The staff looked over the situation and waived the overdraft fees, and they were incredibly friendly and helpful in the process. It's a good bank for people who need a reliable bank and no fees or minimums to juggle.",2017-05-05
1062,The Truth Behind Ally Bank,27677,277,Ally Bank,38880,5,"Initially upon getting an account with Ally I was a bit concerned. The bank doesn't really have any actual physical locations. Can I really go without having a physical location? Absolutely! I initially opened up a Money Market Account and Savings because the interest percentages were the best on the market. In addition I got another checking account and have been banking with them since 2008 happily and with no issues. Through the years I've had my account I have found many advantages I couldn't get per se at your traditional bank. I love the fact that all your ATM fees, if charged are refunded once a month. I have 24/7 access to customer service and not only are they simply phenomenal and understanding. I feel like I can really make an actual quick 5 minute call instead of having to jump through hoops and hoops of prompts to get to a single person who than transfers me. I don't think I have ever been transferred to anyone when calling Ally. Lastly I want to mention the mobile app. I love that I can access the mobile web page and/or use the mobile applications. My fear of not having a bank locally for deposits was relieved when Ally chose to do their mobile deposits. It's super simple and easy and sets your expectations on when you deposit something when to get a response (which you get emailed if it has been accepted or if there are any issues) along with when to expect the deposit as long as it clears! Online bill pay is simple and also is cut and dry stating when to expect the withdrawal/payment to be received by your bill payer. I highly recommend Ally with pride.",2017-05-04
1063,Online Savings Account with Ally Bank,27670,277,Ally Bank,38872,5,"I created an account with Ally Bank because of their competitive interest rates for savings account and because the traditional bank I used for checking had paltry rates. I was able to create the account and transfer the initial balance from a checking account with another bank into this savings account. I have also been able to set up re-occurring transfers, automating my savings. I have not had to interact with their customer service department at this time, but have found their site to be user-friendly. I also have online statements. Overall, a very positive experience and excited that there are still savings accounts with decent interest rates.",2017-05-03
1064,Ally Bank is great for people who get paid online.,27606,277,Ally Bank,38746,4,"I use Ally for our primary savings account. I can transfer this money into a checking account, then use my Mastercard debit card to pay at checkout or withdraw cash from ATMs. I can even cash checks using the camera on my phone and the Ally Bank app. It's all really very handy.<br/> <br/>Rates are reasonable and fees are pretty much nonexistent. There are free ATMs all over town and Ally will reimburse you for fees charged by other ATMs (up to ten dollars per month).<br/> <br/>I'm really quite satisfied with Ally and expect to bank with them far into the future. I would definitely recommend them.",2017-05-02
1065,Ally Feedback,27601,277,Ally Bank,38741,5,"Ally bank has been an excellent resource and bank and the interest rates that they offer for their savings accounts makes them stand out from their competition. Their customer service is also exceptional. There was two instances in particular in which I had unknown fees like an overdraft fee. I called them for clarification and they ended up removing the fee from my account. Their customer service is excellent and they are always there for support regarding any banking or loan questions that you may have. I have several family members that also do most of their banking with Ally and have found them easy to work with and very competitive with the interest rates they offer. Currently, I have a Money market, checking account, and savings account through Ally and I have also been considering opening up a CD.",2017-04-29
1066,Ally is a GREAT Bank for Checking/Savings,27597,277,Ally Bank,38737,4,"Ally has impressed me so far. I have been with them for about a year now. Their checking/saving account is a no BS account with no confusing fees and a small annual yield of 1%(in my case.) I have had 2 issues with the account receiving an overcharge fee, of $25, which they removed for me. They didn't have to do that but they did it anyways. I would recommend this bank to anyone looking for a no BS online bank they can trust.",2017-04-28
1067,My experience with Ally Bank,27590,277,Ally Bank,38730,5,"As you would expect with an online bank, the web and mobile services were top notch and much more user friendly than traditional stone and mortar establishments. You can tell that since the emphasis is for online service from the get go, they make sure the offerings on their website are easily accessible. I also liked that the bank reimburses you every cycle for checking account maintenance fees. I have yet to find a traditional bank that is willing to reimburse for checking account service fees and in this instance Ally Bank stand out from the rest. The only issue I have is customer service, if you want to meet face to face, you cannot.",2017-04-26
1068,Great flexibility,27584,277,Ally Bank,38724,5,"Being an entrepreneur, I needed a bank that is flexible and I could work with no matter where I was. Ally has filled those needs for me. By not having brick and motor locations they are more flexible and pass the savings on to use the customers. It is the only bank that I found that offers a savings account that gives me 1% annual interest and a checking account with .1% interest. They are proactive when watching out for fraud and I have never had a problem dealing with the customer service. They reimburse you for all ATM fees, which is a must for me because I use ATMs religiously. All and all Ally is just a great bank thank is changing the way the bank industry does business.",2017-04-25
1069,Couldnt have asked for a better bank,27487,277,Ally Bank,38499,4,"I have never been more thrilled to work with a bank that cares so much about their customers and really focus on what they do for their customers. Ally is always readily available to speak on the issues facing their customers. I have never waited for more than 3 minutes to speak to a real, live person. I always am able to get through quickly and get to the right resource. With other banks, its always a wait, even to talk to a rep at a branch it would take minutes. They also offer one of the most competitive rates on interest for their customers. Its a great value to have when it comes to casual banking. I think that everyone should take a look at ally today.",2017-04-21
1070,Ally Bank and the revolution of Online Banking,27481,277,Ally Bank,38493,4,"Around a year ago I decided to switch to Ally Bank for my savings account. They offered some of the most competitive interest rates at 1% for the savings account. The customer service experience was fantastic, as customers we have the ability to instant message with their customer service team. With this tool I was able to get all of my questions answered a lot faster than I have in the past with other financial institutions. Also, the banks website is easy to navigate and they are able to quickly move money between my savings account I hold there and my other accounts I have spread out over other financial institutions. The reason I chose Ally was for the 1% interest rate on a savings account, but I was surprised and very pleased with the customer service and other benefits I received.",2017-04-20
1071,Why I Love Ally,27478,277,Ally Bank,38490,5,"Ally is one of the best online only banks out there. Despite the fact that there are no brick and mortar locations, this is the best bank I've ever had. I actually am a consumer lender for another bank and still maintain an account with Ally. There are NO maintenance fees, the app is amazingly well designed and streamlined. I can deposit checks easily. Their funds availability policy is readily accessible online, as well as their ACH cutoff times. Most banks (the one I work at included) go to great lengths to not exactly hide this information, but at least do the bare minimum to make it accessible. Also, a 1% APY on a savings account is about the best rate you'll find anywhere, at least on smaller checking accounts. Can't say enough good things about Ally. The app is so well designed that I have honestly never had to call customer service. If you're a responsible consumer and mostly rely on direct deposit and your debit card, you really don't even need another bank.",2017-04-19
1072,Ally Banking,27473,277,Ally Bank,38485,5,"I have really liked using Ally Banking thus far. Any time that I have ever had an issue, I have been able to talk to a customer service representative promptly and they have always been super helpful. I have also been very happy with their Savings Account interest rate. I know it doesn't seem like a lot, but getting 1% back is definitely a lot more than most other banks. One thing that I really enjoyed about Ally is that I had an issue with Identity theft. Someone had tried to access my bank account from another state or country. I immediately got a text message from them that my account had been closed and a representative called me within 10 minutes to assure me that everything was okay and that my account was closed.",2017-04-17
1073,Ally Bank,27470,277,Ally Bank,38482,4,"I began using Ally Bank a year or so ago. I wanted something that I could easily keep track of my earnings and not have to worry about anything. Ally gave me all this. The best part is, there are no fees associated with my account. Account set up was quick and easy, I had my account and routing number as soon as I completed my form. My debit card showed up about 3 days later. When I transfer money into Ally, the money is there by 4am the next day. I honestly have never had a better banking experience. I love the fact that I can deposit checks from the app on my phone, I haven't had to call customer service yet, but I'm told it's one of the best customer services around. I was really nervous about getting an online bank account, but to be honest, I'm sad that I didn't do it years ago.",2017-04-17
1074,"High Interest, Low Stress",27463,277,Ally Bank,38475,4,"I have been banking with Ally, among other banks, for several years now. I was simply looking for a place to park some liquid cash and earn anything other than 0% interest. For a nationally available bank, Ally is about the best you can do. I enjoy a 1% interest rate on my online savings account and have great flexibility with withdrawals, additions, transfers, etc. There are no hoops to jump through or deposit requirements or average minimum balances. I have never had to use customer service because everything has been so simple. The Ally mobile app is also very user friendly and meets my standards for a modern app. Additionally, broad ATM presence and I have never been charged an ATM fee. No issues here. Great bank.",2017-04-14
1075,Pretty good experience,27459,277,Ally Bank,38471,3,"I only use the account for saving, checking and a credit card transaction account. It has been a pretty good experience so far, I really enjoy the online component because it prevents the need from travelling to banks. The agents have been very helpful and nice in the process, but it was pretty hard to use their online website at first. I have some savings money for my future expenditures for college. I always pay my credit card bills on time and there is no overdraft fee for me because I know a personal relative in the institution. As well, there have been no stupid fees, so I am pretty happy for that.",2017-04-13
1076,No hassle and no fees,27454,277,Ally Bank,38466,5,I have been banking with Ally Bank and so far my experiences were overwhelmingly positive comparing my conventional bank. I own Savings accounts and CD through Ally. I have more than one savings accounts and their annual percentage yield is from 0.85% to 1.00% which is the most I have gotten so far. My initial starter savings of just 20 USD gave me 0.01 interest within 2 months which is compared to my other bank was unbelievable. My 3 months High Interest CD yields right now about 0.35% which I also found outstanding given that I only invested a 1000 USD. There is no fees connected to handling the account and there is a very handy mobile app that is easy to use on the go. I also received physical cards connected to my savings accounts on which I can make withdrawals without fee. I have not yet tried to withdraw money in this way from my account but making online transfers are very simple. Transferring money from a different bank takes about 3-5 workdays which isn't too bad. The live online chat help is available if I have questions but everything is clear and straightforward on their website.,2017-04-11
1077,Banking with Ally Bank,27450,277,Ally Bank,38462,5,"I have been banking with Ally Bank, off and on, for many years. I started banking with them when they were GMAC Bank. After they were sold, they renamed themselves as Ally Bank. During that time, I had several CDs with them. I had no problems with them through the transition as they honored the terms of the CDs. Once the CDs matured, I was able to transfer the balances to my local bank. <br/> <br/>Back in 2012, Ally Bank offered some attractive rates on 2-year CDs so I purchased 3 CDs for $2000 each a few months apart. I renewed them on 2014, and they gave me a .25% adder on top of the CD rate just for my loyalty. I cashed them in the Summer of last year and had no problems with the transactions. <br/> <br/>This Fall, Ally Bank offered a 1% interest rate on their on-line savings account. I decided to open a savings account with them as the highest rate I have seen on a ""brick and mortar"" bank was .20% and on-line bank had been .95%. I made a deposit last November and have been periodically adding to the savings account since then. <br/> <br/>In short, I have been banking with Ally Bank for several years and have had no issues with their service and performance.",2017-04-11
1078,Ally provides a great experience,27446,277,Ally Bank,38458,4,"I've used Ally banks for the past year, and I've had a great experience so far. They are my main bank that I use for my everyday banking (checking, savings), and I love how connected they are digitally speaking. The app that they provide is easy to use, and the wait time between a deposit from my brick and mortar bank and money being available is excellent for an online bank (3 business days). My experience with customer service representatives were that they very understanding and handled any situations promptly, I recently had an issue with a check I deposited. I like the feature of being able to name my accounts whatever I want so that I always know what they are used for at a glance, this is perfect for a person like myself with multiple checking and savings accounts. Their savings and checking APY rates are very competitive and almost double what most banks offer. The debit card connected to your checking account offers rewards, unheard of these days. You cant lost with this online bank, I would rank it above and beyond most regular banks.",2017-04-10
1079,Ally Bank Savings,27439,277,Ally Bank,38451,5,"I have opened a savings account with Ally bank about a year ago. The main attraction was a one percent interest rate which is way more than my accounts in other (brick and mortar) banks yield. Opening account was a breeze. No fees, and i was able to transfer money from my checking account in a different bank pretty much right away. Both website and mobile app give me full control over what i want to do. I have monthly deposits scheduled and so far no issues encountered. I have also used Ally savings account to fund my Stash account, also with no issues. You only get 6 free transactions a month (unlimited deposits) , but considering that this is a savings and not a checking account, it works for me. Overall, i am very pleased with the service i receive from Ally Bank.",2017-04-08
1080,Excellent Bank,27419,277,Ally Bank,38407,4,"I have banked with Ally Bank for over 2 years now and it has been a great experience. I have found that the customer service is excellent and is available 24/7, which has been very convenient as I do a lot of traveling and have often needed the representatives at random hours of the night. The only issue I have ever had with the bank is that there is no way to deposit cash, but this is often found with online banks. The interest rates are higher than any banks I have banked with previously and there are no fees. The bank even reimburses you for ATM fees (up to a certain monthly limit) if you have to go to another bank's ATM. As a young adult, this has been one of my first banking experiences by myself and I have found it to be very user friendly and accessible. Overall, I would and have recommended Ally to my friends.",2017-04-07
1081,Best interest around,27416,277,Ally Bank,38404,5,Not many banks offer 1% interest on their savings without having to jump through hoops. Ally does! Customer service is also top notch. They have a wait timer on their website. And the wait has never been longer than a minute when I had questions. Bank transfers have also become easier in 2017. Only taking 24 hours to transfer money to other institutions. It use to take 3 days.,2017-04-06
1082,Ally is a good way to save.,27396,277,Ally Bank,38343,4,I have used an Ally high yield savings account. It was simple to set up and I was able to do so completely from their website. It was easy to set up automatic transfers to and from the account. I was able to get a good return on the savings account at the time in comparison to other high yield savings accounts. I would recommend Ally to anyone that wants to create an easy way to start a savings account.,2017-04-06
1083,Best Banking Experience,27389,277,Ally Bank,38336,4,"I have never been more thrilled to work with a bank that cares so much about their customers and really focus on what they do for their customers. Ally is always readily available to speak on the issues facing their customers. I have never waited for more than 3 minutes to speak to a real, live person. I always am able to get through quickly and get to the right resource. With other banks, its always a wait, even to talk to a rep at a branch it would take minutes. They also offer one of the most competitive rates on interest for their customers. Its a great value to have when it comes to casual banking. I will highly recommend Ally to anyone who is seeking to switch.",2017-04-05
1084,Good service,27380,277,Ally Bank,38327,4,"A decent bank that offers some decent service. As I had never tried something related to just online banking by itself, I went ahead and thought maybe it is worth a shot and won't be that bad. So I tried it. I had some questions, so the first thing I did was look up some information and then contact them. The wait times on the phone were not bad at all it was actually pretty fast. I had just dialed in so I went through their automated system which was rather easy and nice. Then in under five minutes I was actually speaking with someone and they were very courteous and nice to me, taking their time, and in no time at all my issues were resolved. I was pretty impressed with that. Overall it is not perfect but no service is. It is excellent and is easy to get the information when you do want to start up as their service is on hand most of the time and I do not regret signing up for their service.",2017-04-04
1085,Ally is full featured and responsive.,27377,277,Ally Bank,38324,4,"I have been an Ally interest checking account holder for about five years. I've had an excellent experience with this bank. In the beginning, the mobile app had some issues. I had difficulty depositing checks with my smartphone, but they've worked all of that out. The latest version of the mobile app is much easier to use. Ally presents themselves as a bank that is geared toward mobile banking and you can tell they've put a lot of effort into designing their technology to accommodate the mobile user.<br/> <br/>Two years ago, I received a call from Ally's fraud alert department inquiring if I was attempting to check into a hotel in China. I was not. Ally's fraud alert recognized that this was probably not a valid transaction and they contacted me to check. Over the phone, their customer service agent listed the last few charges on my account to see what the last one I actually made was, and then cancelled my debit card refunded me the one small fraudulent charge they found and issued me a new debit card that arrived in three days. I was very impressed with the way it was handled.<br/> <br/>Ally has fairly competitive rates for their products (I earn .1%). Interest rates are low everywhere but if I was pressed for one area of improvement, I would say higher rates would be nice. Right now, a savings account through Ally yields 1% which is not the worst.",2017-04-04
1086,Good customer service,27366,277,Ally Bank,38313,3,"Overall I enjoyed my time with Ally. I opened a savings account 5 years ago in the hopes of saving money, out of sight. The appeal of a no brick and mortar bank made it seem that pulling money out would be harder to do. Also, another reason I picked them at the time is because the interest rate at the time was slightly better than the banks in my area. The rate wasn't much higher but still a little higher which worked for me. Moving money around was actually a lot easier than I realized. I had to call customer service a couple months back to dispute a transaction and the rep I worked with was amazing. She thoroughly reviewed my account to see what what had happened and resolved the issue within 24 hours. I really did love Ally, but closed my account so I could have everything in one place at my local credit union. I still highly recommend Ally when someone wants to bank online since their site is so user friendly, the customer service reps are great and their fees/interest rates are competitive.",2017-04-03
1087,Nice transition to online,27289,277,Ally Bank,38140,4,"After many years of banking with traditional banks, a friend of mine convinced me to try out online banking with Ally Bank. I was hesitant at first to say the least, although I consider myself tech savvy, and I do almost everything else online, I always thought that banking and finances are things I would prefer to do the traditional way. However, after banking with Ally Bank for the past 10 months, I have to say 'm impressed. I have a lot less fees overall than I used to with my regular bank, and I still have access to my money for free at the very same ATMs I used to use with my other bank, at no additional cost. Overall, I am happy with my services at Ally.",2017-04-02
1088,Ally is truly an Ally when it comes to online banking,27274,277,Ally Bank,38106,5,"I've been with Ally for almost 3 years now. I gotta admit at first I was a little skeptical going with a online only bank. But after the first couple of months I felt I was at home. I have a checking and a savings account. The savings account has a 1.0% annual yield or interest rate and my checking account has a 0.10% interest rate. I know that's alot higher than my last physical bank that I was with. As far as ATM fees, they have a specific ATM that they ask you to use and if you go with the ""special"" ATM there will be no fees, but if you have to use one that charges a fee, ALLY will pay you back up to $10 every month for ATM fees. I've never had any problems out of these guys, the only thing that has happened a few times is their mobile app goes down and I can't use it. It's happened quite a few times, but it's always back up in a few hours. Other than that, they've been a joy to bank with !",2017-04-01
1089,Best Bank,27269,277,Ally Bank,38101,5,"I opened an account in Ally bank after I had heard so much good about it and decided to give it a try. I wasn't disappointed at all. I started with a regular checking account and opening it was no trouble at all. Their agent welcomed me with a smile and she even gave me a reward offer if I were to bring in at least two more clients. So I went and talked to my friends and I got three people to open checking account. As reward, I received $125 in my checking account. Their services are really good and they offer online banking as well as mobile banking which facilitates the services.",2017-03-31
1090,Excellent Bank,27250,277,Ally Bank,38065,5,"Ally bank is the best bank I ever dealt with. The reason for choosing Ally Bank is that they have atm reimbursement. I travel a lot, and with my previous bank, I incurred lots of fees ranging from 2 to $5. I also enjoy the fact that they give a better than average percentage rate for checking and cd accounts. I have both checking and savings along with a cd account. The people of ally are very friendly, knowledgeable, and address any issues I may have. Deposits are easy, and online transactions in most cases, are available within 24 hours. The mobile app makes depositing checks easy and convenient, and the mobile app is easy to navigate. You can't ask for much more from a banking institution.",2017-03-30
1091,Ally's Rates,27332,277,Ally Bank,28491,3,"So far I have had a good experience with Ally having purchased (5) CDs last year to construct 5-rung ladder. Now as my 12-month CD reached maturity, I was planning on rolling it over by purchasing a new 5-year CD at Ally. However, I am finding that Ally does not have a competitive rate for their 5-year $25k CD which is currently 2.0% vs 2.3% for the competitors. I will be giving Ally until this Friday 03/31/2017 to at least match the competitors before shifting my CDs to a new provider. On another note, I just learned that I will not qualify for the .05% relationship bonus rate when I rollover from a IRA distribution to a non-IRA CD. Bad enough when the relationship rate was lowered from .25% to .05%. I really would like to remain at Ally but I must follow the money.",2017-03-28
1092,Awful Bank,27318,277,Ally Bank,38224,1,"I've had headaches from the start with Ally, but my most recent one has to do with the fact that they don't accept cash deposits. I had to get money orders, which were no problem, but then they were sent back to me with an issue i had to deal with. I fixed the issue and sent them back in the enclosed, pre-addressed envelope, and they've disappeared. The bank can't find them, and are doing little to resolve the issue. I've since changed banks, and now all I want is those two money orders returned to me.",2017-03-27
1093,Will Never Go Back to a Brick-and-Mortar Bank,27217,277,Ally Bank,38014,5,"I have a checking and savings account with Ally bank. I switched to them from Bank of America because I was between jobs and getting crushed with fees from BofA from not maintaining minimum balances and other things they make you do to keep accounts with them. Ally has no fees for their accounts, no minimum balances, nothing. I have so many good things to say about them:<br/> <br/>Their savings account has a 1% interest rate, compared to .01% from BofA (and many other large banks) so I actually make a little money off my savings every month. They also allow you to send money to anyone for free. That's how I pay my rent every month.<br/> <br/>Customer service is great. I've never been on hold with them for more than a minute, and they take the time to help you out. One time an ATM machine ate $40 I was trying to get out and Ally reimbursed me for the money.<br/> <br/>They reimburse you up to $10 in ATM fees every month, so you can go to any ATM at any bank or gas station a few times a month and never pay fees. They also have a preferred network of ATMs that don't have fees but I've honestly never needed to use one because of the reimbursement.<br/> <br/>One potential downside is you can't deposit cash, which could be a problem for people who get paid in cash, and that sometimes it's convenient to be able to get things like cashier's checks immediately instead of waiting by mail. But by and large I couldn't be happier with them. Wish everyone would switch to these smaller banks, they treat you so much better.",2017-03-25
1094,Online Banking Made Easy with Ally!,27137,277,Ally Bank,37803,4,"I opened an online bank account with Ally Bank a few months ago and I have been very pleased. I wanted to open a savings account that I would have access to if necessary, but one that I wouldn't be able to just go to the bank and withdraw money from. Saving money is hard for me! I love Ally because it does take a few days for the money to transfer to a checking. I know that some people would consider that a detriment, but it really helps me to stop and consider if I really need to transfer the funds. My savings account with Ally has a good interest rate, and interest is added into my account every month. Though the APY isn't enough to swoon over, it's significantly higher than other banks and shows that Ally's business model is truly to offer the best in class. <br/> <br/>I haven't needed to call customer service, but Ally's website displays the current wait time for their customer service line at all times. I see this every time I log in, and more often than not, it reads 0 minute wait. I'm very satisfied with my Ally experience and will stay for the long haul.",2017-03-24
1095,Ally Bank - easy and simple way to save money,27124,277,Ally Bank,37790,5,"I've been using Ally Bank exclusively for savings for about a year now. Previously I tried to save money with the bank in which I have a checking account and credit card but found that it was too tempting to transfer money out of savings whenever I needed it. With Ally, the money is more ""out of sight, out of mind"" and transfers take a few days to process. I get a 1% return on savings with interest compounded monthly, which is quite competitive in today's market. I have never had any issues opening or closing accounts, depositing money, or withdrawing it to another account. I have also used the chat function for customer support a few times and found it easy to use. Overall, I'm very glad I decided to move my savings to Ally and would recommend it to anyone looking for a similar service.",2017-03-21
1096,"Great service, great features",27120,277,Ally Bank,37786,4,"One of the biggest things I appreciate about Ally Bank is the comparatively high interest rates for savings and checkings accounts as well as the refunded ATM fees. In fact, I consider the refunded ATM fees to be essentially part of the interest rates. Moreover, the app and web interface provide everything I need for banking--checks are quickly and easily deposited via the app and my account information is always readily available. I also apprecite the ability to quickly make transfers between both Ally and non-Ally accounts. I also had some issues when moving with changing my address and while the bank did initially make a mistake in cancelling my account, it was quickly rectified and every customer service agent I interacted with along the way was courteous, informative, and helpful.",2017-03-20
1097,Average experience with Ally Bank,27115,277,Ally Bank,37781,4,"I had a fair experience with Ally. I do most of my banking online and appreciated that everything was accessible online. I was never charged an overdraft or fee that I did not expect, and had no issues on the financial end. The only true problem I had with this bank was that it always took a long amount of time to be able to reach someone on the phone. I usually prefer to go inside of a bank when I have a problem, but the amount of time that it took to get through to someone made it a slight drawback. Also, the deposits usually deposited with a day or two, but on the weekends or holidays, this amount of time was questionable and could range anywhere from 1-7 days. I ended up closing this account because it ended up being more of a hassle than the bank I already have.",2017-03-18
1098,Ally is great!,27062,277,Ally Bank,37697,5,Ally bank is one of the more competitive banks on the market. Offering a great rate on savings and on checking. Although it is an online only bank they are able to offer everything local banks do. They have free atms available in a lot of locations. And offer $10 /month for atm that charge fees. Direct deposit is easy to setup and theres no delay in deposit. You can also take pictures of checks to get them deposited. 24/7 customer service and its with a real person. Wait times are never long. They even have a timer on their website showing wait times,2017-03-15
1099,"Ally banks: Decent fees, excellent customer service for a digital world",27055,277,Ally Bank,37691,4,"I've used Ally banks for the past two years, and it's been a mostly happy experience. They are my main bank that I use for my everyday banking (checking, savings, etc.), and I love how connected they are technologically speaking. The app that they provide is easy to use, and the wait time between a deposit and money being available is excellent. I recently had my information stolen, and the customer service representatives were very understanding and handled the situation promptly. <br/> <br/>The only negatives I've found while using them have been the ATM fees. They seem to be higher than the norm, and I always seem to notice a bigger chunk of my income disappearing down the drain each month. I know that I could allay some of these grievances if I made the trek across town anytime I need to withdraw cash, but having to choose between convenience and big hit monetarily via atm fees definitely sucks.",2017-03-14
1100,A good bank is one you don't hear from,26982,277,Ally Bank,37471,5,"I used ally bank for the last three years after having moved from st. louis and no longer being able to bank with my credit union. I usually steer clear of banks in general, but I wanted one that would accept my card and have locations across the country as I am a traveler now. This bank is about as good as I could imagine one being. It doesn't charge me random fees like overdraft, the staff is usually friendly and attentive to my needs, and their hours are pretty reasonable for me to come in and talk to an advisor. I have not downloaded their app or used any other products, so I cannot speak to much about this bank outside of my experience, which is with checking and savings accounts, but my money goes where I want it to go, and there is no errors or faulty charges that usually come up with these sorts of banks.",2017-03-13
1101,Great savings rate,26951,277,Ally Bank,37396,5,"I opened a savings account with Ally bank last year after extensive research. Previously, I had savings account with Chase. The reason I decided to switch bank for my savings was because Chase's annual percentage yield was dismal something like 0.01%. So, I researched online for the best savings account bank that is reliable and has good customer service. And my search ended when I came across Ally. They have one of the best rate of any of the banks almost 1%. I must tell you that they have great customer service and the wait for online rep is never lengthy. I have also found that they take security very seriously. I don't think anyone can hack into my account. They have tough security measures. So I am very happy to see my money grow at Ally. One thing that might deter certain folks from choosing this bank is that they don't have physical branches or ATM. Everything is online, which I am okay with. I do everything online on my phone with apps but for some people who use checks and deposits, it might be difficult. But you can always use the app to deposit checks. The app is friendly and easy to use. Overall I highly recommend Ally!",2017-03-10
1102,A great alternative to a traditional bank,26948,277,Ally Bank,37393,4,Ally bank is a great alternative to traditional banks. They do not have any physical locations but they do offer many services despite this. They waive the ATM fees at most ATMs near me so I don't have to worry about paying money just to withdraw money. I like this bank because they also have great customer support. They understand that because they don't have any actual locations they must be easily accessible over the phone. I have never had a long lasting problem with Ally. They believe that they should just resolve situations instead of complicating or dragging them out. I will continue to bank with Ally because they are reliable and care about the customers. I would rate them ten stars out of ten.,2017-03-09
1103,Why I choose this Bank,26944,277,Ally Bank,37389,5,I was shopping for an online bank that had the best CD rate when I choose Ally Bank. I ha never worked with an online bank before so this was a new experience for me. As a novice I ended up calling their customer service many times with questions and requests for help with setting my account up. I was always given very good service and many times their representative ended up spending more than 15 minutes helping through whatever problem I was having! I likes the bank and it's CD rates so much that I stayed with them for two years. When I closed my account it was due to my need for CD's cash so I could pay for my children's college education. Two years later I received a check in the mail from the bank stating that I had not completely closed the account out and the check was what I had l left in the account. Now the bank could have just waited and turned it over to the states unclaimed property department but they choose to make the attempt to mail it to me first. As I said their service was great!,2017-03-08

I emailed and I called only to be put through the same road trip around the world to find me. <br/><br/>Finally on 2-2 which was 10 days earlier then I received the letter saying the dispute was settled in my favor. This is now March 7, I have tried to get the money transferred but they have a restriction on my own money so I have no access to it. I finally got a hold of someone that was going to transfer the funds to my checking account ---- 4 hours later a call was placed to me to tell me .. NO.. can't do that you are restricted.. ok just let me have my money and never NEVER see Ally again. I now have to wait for a check, which I orignally asked for in Jan. to close the account and now guess what it will take 7-10 days by mail to get my check. I can't even explain in any language the stupidity this company displays. I know it is only 100bucks but they have had my money for 3 months and me... not able to touch it. <br/><br/>I can't even wrap my head around the stupidity.",2017-03-07
1105,Excellent bank,26933,277,Ally Bank,37378,4,"I was shopping for a new bank and my girlfriend suggested looking into Ally Bank. I took her advice and ended up opening an account with them. The process was simple and very easy. This bank is FDIC insured which is very important to me, especially in unsettled times. The customer service representative that I spoke to when I opened the account was very friendly and helpful. She treated me as an individual and not just another faceless person. The website is adequate for my needs. I ended up setting up not one, but two different accounts with Ally. I am very pleased with their very competitive interest rates on their accounts. The interest is compounded daily, not monthly like many other institutions. The higher interest rate and security I have with this bank is what I wish many other banks would ascribe to. I have since referred a couple of my friends to this bank and they have also set up accounts. It is unusual for me to be completely pleased with a bank, but Ally Bank has been able to fulfill all of my needs.",2017-03-05
1106,Great Option for Those Who Don't Deal With Cash,26931,277,Ally Bank,37376,5,"I've had a checking and savings account with Ally Bank for about a year now. The pros: great rates on savings products, no fees (that I've encountered yet), easy to use, good app and website, reimbursement of ATM fees. The cons: I've only had one interaction with a customer service agent. And while she answered my question, she was a bit rude in the process. Also, this may not be the best option if you deal with a lot of cash. I have gotten a bit of cash recently and have no alternative but to sit on it and not deposit it. So if you never deal with cash or only use it rarely and don't mind not being able to deposit it, it's not a big deal. I mostly received checks and direct deposit. Checks are a breeze with their Ally app, I can deposit them using my smartphone. If you don't have a smartphone or don't want to deposit using the app, you can mail them to Ally with a deposit slip and they will deposit them for you. But this is not something I've tried.<br/> <br/>All in all, I've had a good experience so far. They don't hassle me and provide exactly the service I need, so overall I would recommend them.",2017-03-04
1107,Best Online Savings Rates,26852,277,Ally Bank,37173,5,"I use to bank with Sallie Mae for my money market and savings needs. The rates slowly weren't as high and the transfer speeds were very slow. When I switched to Ally a few months ago I was impressed with both the ease of use and high Money Market and savings rate. One of the nice things with Ally is the quickness of access to your money. When you do an echeck deposit through their app it clears very quickly. Other banks make you wait a week for funds availability. Ally did not, they have 3-4 business day access. Also my deposits are sent from my bank to their bank within 3 business days and I have access to those funds as early as the 3rd day. Other online banks were a week hold. The set up process for my account was super easy online. If I were to recommend any online bank account I would highly recommend Ally. You will have the highest savings rates and easy online access. They still connect you to a brick and mortar bank in which you currently have. This gives you fast access to cash if you need to write a check to yourself or wire funds back. They have many ATM's and a debit card to access your money with the Money Market or checking accounts with no fees. Don't be fooled by other online banks, Ally truly brings back the spirit of old customer banking with new technological advantages.",2017-03-01
1108,Best Bank Ever,26847,277,Ally Bank,37168,5,"I have had an online savings account with Ally Bank for awhile. I love this bank! Their interest rates are always at the top offered anywhere and they have never disappointed me. Through the years, the rates have fallen, but it still has the best rate of any bank. It is very easy for me to transfer money from my account to any other account I have. The wait time is 2 days at the most. I have contacted them several times for customer service and their representatives are knowledgeable and very helpful. They solve any problem to my satisfaction and makes me feel like a valued customer. I would highly encourage anyone interested in an online savings account to seriously consider Ally Bank. You will not be disappointed.",2017-03-01
1109,My Ally Experience,26840,277,Ally Bank,37159,4,"I've been banking with Ally for a little over a year now. I used to bank with Baxter Credit Union, as well as Capital One but switched to Ally.<br/> <br/>At first I was skeptical to bank purely online, because my first banking experience (with Capital One) was in an actual brick and mortar bank, I had met my banker in person and he had helped set me up completely. Let me clarify quickly, when I say ""bank"" I mean concerning checking and savings. With Ally though you never really see or hear anyone IN PERSON. However, the 24/7 Customer Service they reference on their website and their TV commercials is true believe it or not. I tend to not really need customer support all the time but for those who rely on it, I could see how it's useful. The times I did need their help they never seemed to rush me or be rude to me.<br/> <br/>As for their products, they have excellent savings accounts and CDs and great rates. Their online access makes them easy to use and frees up my time for other things than making trips to the bank. I haven't had any issues with the app and use it a lot.",2017-02-27

I earn .1% interest on my account balance, I can take a picture of ny paper checks that I have and I have any atm that I can use that is close to me. Though, I wish there was more accessibility to ATMs but they do offer my a 10 credit a month for any charges I receive at another atm i use. There is also no monthly fees, chase was going to charge me 6 dollars a month. I could not afford that. They also have 24/7 service which I have used once when I lost my card and need to get money out in a jiffy. They had overnighted me a new card at no cost, though this was a one time convenience. there overdraft is also considerable less then Chase!",2017-02-27
1111,Ally bank - Great experience,26762,277,Ally Bank,36959,4,I have been a customer at Ally bank from the very beginning. They were once known as GMAC bank which I was a customer. In the 8-10 years I've been with them I have not been disappointed. Their money market has paid a steady (or almost steady) 1% ever since I've had their account which is fantastic. Transfers in or out unlike other banks that I use take 2 days vs. 5 or more for others. The best part is the 24 x 7 customer service with a live person in the US. I've used them once or twice when I got stuck. They tell you how long you have to wait upfront which is very helpful. Hope this is helpful to your readers.,2017-02-24
1112,Great Rates and Great Customer Service,26756,277,Ally Bank,36953,5,"This bank was recommended by a friend when we were talking about the lousy rates banks give on saving and CD accounts. I was a bit skeptical at first of dealing with an ""online only"" bank, but my fears were unfounded. I started with a CD and have now moved my regular savings over to them as well. I made more money in interest there than I have in years in a standard bank. Customer service is great, although everything is so easy, you rarely need to contact them. Everything is very user friendly and I could not be more pleased with a bank. You just can't find these higher rates at any local banks. I recommend this bank to all my friends now. Ally Bank is the go-to place for all my banking needs.",2017-02-23
1113,Much appreciation for Ally Bank,26751,277,Ally Bank,36947,4,"I am a big fan of Ally Bank and truly satisfied with their service. I especially appreciate the mobile app which makes depositing checks and checking my balances fast and easy. Perhaps most significantly, I appreciate that their lack of brick and mortar locations allows then to have higher interest rates for checking and savings accounts, especially in this time of particularly low interest rates. Coupled with the fact that ATM fees are refunded, I feel like any fee I might experience is far outweighed by the benefits. I did have one issue wherein my account was closed due to moving and changing my address to a business rather than a residential address. While inconvenient, the issue was addressed relatively quickly and my interactions with customer service representatives to help resolve the issue were productive and helpful. For these reasons, I have successfully recommended Ally Bank to several friends who are now also very happy with their products and service.",2017-02-22
1114,One of the best online banks,26743,277,Ally Bank,36939,4,I have had a CD account and a Money Market account at Ally Bank for the last five years. The first thing to know is they do not have branches. The second is that for deposit accounts they are one of the best! Their rates are way more competitive than your brick and mortar banks and their website is a simple joy to use. I personally love their Certificate of Deposit accounts. Every year I get a summary of the account and asking me if I would like to renew it for another year. The one time I ran into a problem and had to deal with customer service it was a pleasure. They were extremely nice and were able to resolve my issue very quickly. If you are looking for a new savings account I would highly recommend you consider Ally.,2017-02-21
1115,Great Returns,26739,277,Ally Bank,36935,4,"I have a checking and a savings account through Ally. I started off with a car loan and opted to open up an account as well once I realized how much I liked their service. With the savings account I get a great savings rate for having a savings account with them, and with the checking rate is good since my balance is always at less than $15,000. If you were able to maintain a minimum balance of $15,000 then you would yield an even better rate. I always experience the best customer service whenever speaking with someone directly over the phone. When I use the automated service, I tend to get frustrated because it will either take you in loops because it seems to be always malfunctioning, or it takes a long time to speak with someone depending on the time of day you call. Other than that, I don't have anything negative to say about them. They've always come through in making good on my yield percentage, when I do get someone on the line I always get my questions answered and am satisfied with that part of the experience.",2017-02-20
1116,Solid Online Savings Bank,26793,277,Ally Bank,37022,4,"My experience over the last four years with Ally has been a good one. No nonsense and consistently steady return rate of 1% over the time with no loaded fees. I have, to date, never been charged any fees as they promised.<br/><br/>I have held numerous online savings accounts and have been with this bank through it all! What I really enjoy is that Ally is found in ALL of my personal finance apps like Mint, PersonalCapital, etc. which makes the online connection to the accounts a cinch! Many other obscure banks are not found on the apps which cause a major problem.<br/><br/>Solid online banking experience!",2017-02-19
1117,Good bank for CDs,26738,277,Ally Bank,36934,4,"I opened an account with Ally Bank a few years ago in an effort to take advantage of the quite favorable CD (Certificate of Deposit) rates that this bank consistently offers. The account opening process was easy and concise. I was able to open the account online without any issues. I was able to open a CD with a very good interest rate as compared to other banks. And when it came time to renew the CD, a favorable rate was offered for the renewal. I have had a good experience with this bank. I would recommend this bank to anyone who wants to open a CD with a good interest rate and is comfortable with banking online. Keep in mind that this bank does not have any physical local branches, so if you need this feature, this bank is not for you.",2017-02-18
1118,High Interest Savings with Ally,26645,277,Ally Bank,36672,4,"I still like to have a savings account, it's old fashioned but important to me. Unfortunately, my normal banking options don't offer me much in the way of interest on those savings, even when looking at CDs. After searching around, I found Ally bank. I had my first car loan with them, and I was familiar with their online stance to banking, using them for a savings account and later two CDs turned out to be just as positive.<br/> <br/>First, I did have to get used to the idea of not having a bank that I could walk into when I needed something; however, the web design is very easy to follow and compartmentalized based on what you are using their services for. Secondly, they don't just offer competitive, but at that time, the best rates for savings and CDs. Transferring funds to them is as easy as it can be as long as you are careful about inputting numbers, and their customer care by phone is top notch. <br/> <br/>In many ways, Ally has offered me, and continues to provide, a high level of service. Finding interest rates that at least match inflation these days is difficult, but they do have them, with no fees on savings, which means that if I want to use them as a savings means, compared to other larger, brick banks, I am at least investing my money for the future, without fear of losing the inflation battle in a matter of a few short years. I can't imagine a better bank to use for savings right now.",2017-02-16
1119,Best bank for interest rates and low bank fees,26533,277,Ally Bank,36286,4,"Because Ally Bank is an online bank rather than a brick and mortar bank building, they save their clients money by not having the overhead expense that is usually associated with your typical bank. Because of this, I can go to any ATM machine and rest assured that Ally will refund the entire service fee to my account. They do this because they are strictly an online bank. <br/> <br/>In addition to refunding me $10/month (whether or not I've used the entire $10 that month) that have the best interest rates for their check and savings accounts that I've found. <br/> <br/>Although I haven't used their loans service, I would be interested if I were in need.<br/> <br/>In regards to their customer service, I have rarely had to wait long than 3 minutes and they are friendly and polite.",2017-02-09
1120,Ally Bank: Great rates but the customer service can be lacking,26523,277,Ally Bank,36276,4,"I signed up for Ally bank about 3 years ago when I first heard about it. They had good rates which were much better than anywhere else I had seen and they had no minimum balance for the good rates they offered. I did have a couple difficulties down the years with their system a couple of times and have called customer service and while they have been nice, they haven't necessarily helped me that much with the problems I had. They instead wanted to offer me platitudes and suggest that I wait it out more than anything else. Overall I would suggest the bank to people but I would make sure that you understand that if something goes wrong you might be on your own for a little while until it gets fixed.",2017-02-06
1121,Great Online Bank and Customer Service,26521,277,Ally Bank,36274,5,I use their online savings account. I have never had a problem with any aspect of it. The money transfers very fast and it does not have any problems. It also pays a competitive interest rate. I have also had a problems with some things and the customer service was excellent. I was able to a live person and they were very helpful. They also walked me through it each step and then followed up on it. The one negative was that the money transfer took to long. It can take about 2-3 days to get money from the account into a checking account where it can be used. But that trade off is worth it due the other great features and does pay a great rate. It also does not have a lot of fees. In fact I cannot think of any fees that they do charge. I am not aware of any annual fee or anything like that. Great way to save money if you are able.,2017-02-04
1122,Choosing Ally,26520,277,Ally Bank,36273,4,"Choosing Ally as your provider is a good way to deal with online banking. Checking accounts, and savings, and cd's and more. My personal experience has been well so far, and i have been dealing with them for a few years, and experienced only a few problems. Those problems were fixed and dealt with and stayed a happy customer. They also have good relations with the customer and really great support team if you need to ask any questions about your financial needs. No minimum balances needed to open checking or savings. And even no balance on cd's. They also have credit cards with good APR rates and for your spending needs. I give the bank 4 out 5 stars and i do recommend any body looking to deal with an online bank, choose Ally as your next online bank.",2017-02-03
1123,Ally Bank,26516,277,Ally Bank,36269,5,"My first bank account with an online only bank was with Ally.<br/>They are a wonderful institution. Better in every category than any bank i have used previously.<br/>They offer a decent interest rate on checking and savings accounts which I have. They also offer CDs and the like but I have yet to give that shot.<br/>There are no late fees as far as I can tell I was over drafted for a few days and did not incur any charges. I went into debt with the last bank when I over drafted 1 dollar... They pay interest on time and regularly. One of the cool things is that they reimburse you for ATM fees. Absolutely a blessing to not have to worry about ATM fees. Over all I'm very pleased with Ally. I do not see myself switching any time soon.",2017-02-03
1124,very happy banker,26515,277,Ally Bank,36268,4,"I have banked with ally for almost a year now. Ally bank has been my go-to bank for savings. I have enjoyed the great percent yield on my money when I keep it there and do not touch it. The customer service at Ally is awesome as well. I noticed a maintenance fee on my account early in my experiences with them and was very concerned as the account I had from my understanding was not suppose to have a fee. I called and within just a minute I was talking to an agent. Sure enough, there had been a mistake on their end and my fee was credited back to my account. They are very good at explaining things to you as well. I had many questions about the type of account I had opened when I first started and they walked me right through everything I needed to know about it and what all the benefits are.",2017-02-03
1125,"Superior customer service, Great interest rate on savings, no hidden fees. Very Happy.",26510,277,Ally Bank,36264,4,"Banking with Ally Bank has really given me my faith back in financial institutions. I have had an account with them for over 3 years now and I have always had positive experiences. They do not have a brick and mortar bank, but that is fine with me because I would rather have great interest on my savings account. They are very easy to reach, any time I have a question or concern I have gotten right through when I called them. I have never felt like I was missing out by not having the opportunity to use a local branch. Their customer service is top notch and you can tell that they created their platform to be very customer centered. They even care about how fast you get your money, unlike most banks. They have created a very fast money transfer feature so you can transfer money to another account very quickly. I am consistently earning some decent change each month by banking with them due to their 1% interest rate on savings. This is very helpful because it is so easy to put money in there using their auto-transfer feature, and if I ever need to take some out for unforeseen expenses, that is very easy too. I would strongly recommend their savings account to anyone looking to improve their financial situation and stick to their goals.",2017-02-02
1126,Ally Bank Review,26508,277,Ally Bank,36262,5,"I began banking with Ally Bank in July 2016. I opened an online savings account with Ally Bank after researching the best savings accounts available in the United States. I chose to open an online savings account with Ally Bank because of their low fees (I have no paid any fees, whatsoever), intuitive online interface, and reputation for having excellent customer service. I earn 1% interest on my emergency fund, which I keep in a savings account with Ally Bank. I am able to link my Ally Bank savings account to other bank account I have and move money, online, using the Ally Bank website. The website is easy to use and navigate. The only downside to banking with Ally Bank is the lack of ability to make cash deposits. Because of this reason, I will always have to have a separate bank account open with a bank which has a local branch.",2017-02-01
1127,Best Online Banking,26463,277,Ally Bank,36171,5,"I recently switched my checking account over to Ally banking, maybe 6 months ago or so, and it has been one of the best decisions I have made. They offer a great interest rate on checking accounts and this is wonderful to me. My other bank was incredibly lower. Every time I have talked to someone from Ally on the phone, they have always been pleasant and helpful. Another great perk at Ally is there are not any monthly maintenance fees and I talk to a live person 24/7. These two perks are fantastic!",2017-01-30
1128,A Bank With Security.,26434,277,Ally Bank,36058,4,"I've banked with Ally for about 2 years now and all I can really say is that their bank is one of the only online only banks I've had no issues with. If security is a issue for you trusting a online bank, Take it from me they have you covered. Customer support and service is top notch not just only with online banking but any bank that works outside of the internet as well. The website experience is very smooth and fast, It's not confusing to learn how to go around to maneuver and find your way around the website at all, The site also looks aesthetically pleasing as well so that's a plus. Competitive products is something Ally has been doing all their time in the online banking community. I highly recommend them to anybody for their security, reason APR and fee rates. If you're just starting out to learn how to online bank trust me when I say this, Ally is the bank to go with. Reasonable fee's. Great website, security is very high and you're always going to feel secure with them, I can't stress that enough. If I had to give them rating it would be a 4.5/5 stars. Amazing experience overall banking with them.",2017-01-27
1129,Definitely recommended,26433,277,Ally Bank,36057,4,"I signed up with a savings account with Ally because I was disappointed and disgusted with the savings account interest at all the other banks. Because it doesn't have a physical location, I was leary of using it. But I'd heard a lot of good things about it from my co-workers. I've been pleased thus far. I've had to speak with a customer representative a few times, and I'm satisfied with how they have handled my issues and questions. I haven't had any problems using them. I'm confident in their products and services. It's the only savings account I use because I appreciate their helpful customer representatives and the higher than average interest they offer to their customers.",2017-01-27
1130,My review of Ally Bank's saving account,26430,277,Ally Bank,36054,4,"I have had a savings account with Ally Bank for about 3 years now. I switched to Ally Bank from JP Morgan Chase do to their significantly higher interest rate. Opening the savings account with Ally was very easy and only took a few minutes after a credit score check. The interest payments are made to my account on the 15th of every month and are compounded. The bank has never missed an interest payment to my account.<br/> <br/>I can check my account easily and quickly online through their website. I also downloaded the Ally Bank app for my phone, which I use occasionally and is convenient. There is no minimum amount deposit to open an Ally Bank savings account, so that is nice if you are worried that you cannot maintain a certain amount of money in your account. <br/> <br/>I have only contacted customer service one time and my only fault with the company was that the customer service person I spoke to have a very thick accent and was very hard to understand.",2017-01-27
1131,Great Savings Rates at Ally!,26429,277,Ally Bank,36053,5,"I have had certificates of deposit with Ally Bank for years and have found that they often have the best, most competitive rates. Setting up an account with them was easy. I particularly like their ""Raise Your Rate"" CD. It allows you to change the rate of your CD once during the 11 month CD period, so you can benefit from any rate increases. I have never had any problems with my account at Ally and plan to continue using their services indefinitely. I would highly recommend them if you are looking for competitive savings vehicles!",2017-01-27
1132,Ally Bank is a great bank.,26427,277,Ally Bank,36051,5,I opened a checking account with Ally Bank and I do not regret it one bit. It is very convenient that I have full availability of my money. I can withdraw from any institutions' ATMs and Ally will cover the transaction fees! It is really nice being able to go anywhere to get my money back and not have to worry about paying a huge amount! Thank you Ally Bank for this great customer service.,2017-01-26
1133,Ally Bank is great!,26423,277,Ally Bank,36046,4,"I have been a member of Ally for a little over a year now and have had nothing but positive experiences. When I first signed up, the member who was helping me was very informative and helped me choose the right type of account. I opened a checking account with ally bank that I set up my direct deposit from my part time job in. I have never had any issues with my check not being deposited in time or being able to access my money right away. I think ally has done a great job, and the one time that I called customer service over an online account issue, they were able to help and fix it within the phone call. They were very friendly and professional. I would suggest this bank to anyone who needs access to a safe and reliable bank for checking, savings, or any other needs. Ally is great!",2017-01-26
1134,Great Bank for DIY Online Banking,26422,277,Ally Bank,36045,4,"I am someone who likes to take extreme control of my finances and situation. Ally Bank is a great online bank. The rates are always competitive and when I signed up they had an additional bonus promo which paid just as described and expected. This isn't always the case with bank promotions which I frequently like to take advantage of. The online interface is easy to use and decent to look at, it's intuitive and professional looking without being too stuffy. Like the title says, if you want to do something on your own, this is perfect for it, it's definitely suited for a self-serve style. The only issue I had was trying to call into customer service when I was applying for financing from another institution. The other institution had very particular requirements for verifying deposit accounts and needed a physical address for the institution and it was nearly impossible to receive and the service rep seemed confused. It eventually resolved but it shouldn't have been such an issue.",2017-01-26
1135,Ally Bank is the best of online only alternatives,26405,277,Ally Bank,36004,4,"Although I bank with several different institutions, I choose to keep my emergency savings with Ally Bank. Although I do this mostly because their online savings account pays the highest interest of most of the savings options available to me, I have also had the opportunity to speak with their customer service. Their customer service department ranks very highly when compared with other local banks. When you call them they actually seem happy to speak with you and go out of their way to engage you. I have recently opened a checking account with them as well in order to more quickly access my savings which brings me to my only complaint. As of the writing of this review, it takes 2-3 business days to move money in and out of the institution by way of an EFT draft.",2017-01-24
1136,My experience with Ally banking,26356,277,Ally Bank,35829,4,"Ally banking was my first experience with an online only bank. I was a little reluctant at first but have been very pleased. Ally provides very competitive interest rates on their checking and savings accounts. Furthermore, I can use any ATM in America to draw money or deposit. Ally will reimburse any transaction fee charged for using another bank's ATM machine. Being an online only bank, it is needless to say that the web experience is very good. The website is easy and user friendly. It also does not take very long to contact a representative when calling customer service. This is a big deal since most banks take forever waiting for a representative. The experience is pleasant and I will continue to bank with Ally banking.",2017-01-19
1137,Great bank and Superb Customer Service,26348,277,Ally Bank,35820,5,"I have dealt with Ally Bank for over 3 years and I'd have to say that they are the best by far. The interest rates are always at the top of the range in comparison to other financial institution and the customer service is second to none. I have money market and CD accounts with Ally and doing any transaction with them is always simple and flawless. Their online customer service is pretty good as well, but their phone service is easily accessible, has great hours, and is always there to answer any questions that I may have. While they do not have a brick and mortar building in my area, I am able to get everything that I need to get accomplished with them through online and phone communication.",2017-01-19

Transferring from my account is very simple and is processed quickly. There is no minimum amount to have this account and no monthly or annual fees. I will continue to keep this account and am very well pleased with it. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great online bank.

1139,Ally Bank,26323,277,Ally Bank,35769,4,"I have been an Ally Bank customer for about 6 months and I could not be happier. My savings and checking accounts have provided me better service that my other physical banks. Both accounts earn me interest that is more than my Wells Fargo and Chase account, and I have not had any issues transferring money from them into my Ally accounts. In fact, my checking account from Ally Bank earns more than my Wells Fargo savings account! Six transfers from my other banks a month to my Ally accounts is more than sufficient, and I can find a nearby ATM that are fee-free, but I get $10 a month in ATM fees credit anyway. When I do have a question, I can either call or chat. The alert of hold time on the clean, and easy to navigate web site is normally 0 to 1 minute of wait time, but chat is just as efficient in getting my question answered. I love Ally Bank. Ally makes up for its one-size-fits-all checking option by providing outstanding savings accounts and dependable customer service. Plus, the checking account it offers is a cut above most others.Unlike some of its competitors, Ally's account descriptions and fee schedules don't require translators, and customers won't be hit with unexpected service charges. Even though it may take a while longer before the words ""banking"" and ""fun"" are used together regularly, Ally certainly makes managing one's finances feel like less of a chore.",2017-01-17
1140,An excellent online bank!,26303,277,Ally Bank,35739,4,I have a savings account with Ally bank because the fees are beyond reasonable -- in fact the one I chose has no fees and pays interest on my balance monthly! The only issue I have had was with a password reset and customer service helped me resolve that issue quickly and easily! It was simple to link other accounts with my Ally account giving me the freedom to transfer funds in and out of the Ally and other accounts whenever needed. It does take a few days for a transfer of funds to be available into my checking account (which is with another bank) but that is fine by me. I find the direct deposit option to be the easiest way to save money!,2017-01-16
1141,Internet banking is convenient.,26248,277,Ally Bank,35601,4,"I've been banking with Ally for nearly a year now and I'm completely satisfied. When I first opened my account, the closest free ATM would have been blocks away. But after I opened the account, they added an ATM that was just down the street. Another nice feature is that they'll reimburse any fees for using ATMs that are out of network, up to $10 per statement period (one month). This is nice when you need money fast and don't want to chase down a free ATM using the app. Adding money is simple. The app is awesome. You can cash checks using it. They offer interest earning checking with no minimum deposit, which I find is nice for saving up for things like the holidays or special purchases. The debit card is Mastercard, so it's honored everywhere. I'm very satisfied with Ally Bank and would choose it again.",2017-01-12

It is convenient: Ally is very easy to reach via email and they constantly send me reminders through email. The online savings return is a pretty competitive rate. My checking account is also great! They have no fees whatsoever. I'm so glad there are no monthly maintenance fees as Bank of America was really hard on me when it came to those. I've never run into any issues with the site failing when i need it the most which is a huge relief. I strongly recommend Ally Bank for your baking needs.

This supposedly helps to save costs which are in turn passed onto the customer in terms of higher than normal interest rates. This is my favorite thing about this bank as no other bank's interest rates on savings and checking accounts are anywhere near Ally's. Also, they give you a debit card which you can use to take money out of an atm anywhere in the world. Also, they reimburse you for atm fees. Not just the fee from Ally, but also the fee that the ATM charges. Who else does that?? My favorite thing is probably how easy their website and mobile app are to use.

I deal with customer service and never had a problem on there end, just small one's like the app isn't working right, or I'm getting an error. If those mistakes happen, ally will fix it.

I wanted something with a competitive interest rate because in today's economy, that is difficult to come by. Since they are an online only bank, their overhead cost is lower and they can offer higher interest rates. I was pleased with this idea and they are now my main savings account. They make transferring money very easy. All I have to do is enter my other bank's information and Ally allows me to transfer money in or out whenever I please. The interest compounds daily and they even have a daily interest calculator so you can closely monitor your investment. The interest credits monthly on the exact same date which makes it easy to plan for. Overall I am very pleased with my experience at Ally bank.",2017-01-06

They seem very secure and also the app is fingerprint enabled for iphones so that is also a huge plus.",2017-01-06
1147,Ally Bank Is The Best Online Bank,26194,277,Ally Bank,35498,5,"Ally provides me with a checking account, savings account and debit card. The fees are extremely reasonable and the Savings is free. They also provide me with free overdraft protection as long as I have direct deposit going into my checking account. But, what I love the most about it is the customer service. I was the victim of fraud once, and Ally immediately shut down my card, contacted me and verified whether or not the purchases were mine. Once they verified they were not, they gave me a reimbursement, and a new card within a week. I have been with Ally for years now and its the best online bank I've ever banked with.",2017-01-06
1148,Great online banking!,26193,277,Ally Bank,35497,4,"Ally has been great for me. I have a checking and savings account with them. I get lower fees then other banks with ally for both checking and savings. The customer service is wonderful and understanding to your problem. They have a great online system, it's easy to use and can even deposit checks through your smartphone. I gave been with them for 1 year now and couldn't be happier.",2017-01-05
1149,Love saving with Ally Bank,26191,277,Ally Bank,35495,4,"I've been using Ally Bank for my high interest savings account for the last few years. I often have recommended it to friends because of its website is easy to use and simple and because of the bank's very high rate of return (for a savings account that is). I feel comfortable keeping the largest portion of my liquid savings with Ally Bank even though its online only. Really, when do you ever need to go to the bank any more? Cash transfers are painless and work seamlessly both in and out. Money is usually available to me in my check account about 2-3 days from time of transfer. I recently was notified that they are working to increase transfer speed next year significantly! I look forward to continuing to use Ally bank for some time, and maybe invest in their CDs too.",2017-01-05
1150,I Love Ally Bank,26148,277,Ally Bank,35359,5,"I was looking for a savings account when my brother told me that he had one with Ally Bank. I opened a savings account with them and have never looked back. I chose this bank because they had the highest savings rate. I also like the fact that it is easy to transfer money from my savings account into my other accounts. They use a service called Pop Money, which helps you to transfer money between your Ally savings account and your external banks. I also like that when I need to call them for a question, the hold time is less than one minute to speak with someone and there is not a large maze of buttons to press to speak with a customer service person. I would recommend Ally to anyone looking for a secure place bank to save money with a higher-than-average interest rate.",2017-01-04
1151,Best Bank Ive Ever Had!,26145,277,Ally Bank,35356,5,"Ally had been living up to their name and then some. I have had previous experience in my life with other banks, many of which existed solely to take my money. I have found a bank that really does care about me as a customer and makes sure I am satisfied. Their best feature is how they always answer the phone quickly and work on my issue and get to my business as soon as they can. They have very friendly, and always live customer services reps. I have felt from the very beginning that they were interested in not my business, but keeping me as a customer. They really do hope to do their best, and make their banking experience the best in the industry.",2017-01-04
1152,Ally Bank - Safe and Reliable,26120,277,Ally Bank,35315,4,"My wife and I recently got married and have been saving money for our first home. We considered many different options and avenues to pursue for the best way to save our money. We considered mutual funds and ETFs, but decided that we needed our money to be a little bit more liquid and A LOT more safe. We contacted Ally Bank's website and learned of their ""No Penalty CD."" After spending some time checking around and verifying the legitimacy of the offer, we pulled the trigger and opened an account. Our money is currently growing and we do not face a penalty if we were to withdraw, which is fantastic. We feel that Ally offered the best case scenario for us, and we could not be happier with their services!",2017-01-03
1153,We Are Pleased,26165,277,Ally Bank,35430,5,"My husband and I have been using Ally for a few years now. The mobile app is reliable and so convenient. I love how easy it is to make deposits and transfers. I forgot my pw once and called customer service who was very helpful. For atm fees, Ally reimburses me which is no loss on my part. So far we've been pleased with Ally.",2017-01-02
1154,"Great, caring bank with real people to talk to",26059,277,Ally Bank,35174,4,"I've had savings and checking with this bank for quite some time. My mother and father both had it, too, and they were the ones who recommended it to me. When my dad passed away, I had to work with Ally to remove the money in the account and pay for final expenses. They made this experience very easy, and were very kind with caring words to say about my father, and even thanked me for the whole family being customers. I love how when I call with a question it gets answered right away. Their customer service is really great compared to other banks I've used in the past, and I feel like they are also very trustworthy about the information they give you. Going online to view my account is also very pleasant as they have a great layout.",2016-12-30
1155,Great Experience,26021,277,Ally Bank,35083,5,"I've been a loyal customer of Ally Bank for the last 18 months when I took a new job that requires me to travel alot. I converted all my other savings accounts from a credit union and a larger bank into one easy location that I could access anywhere I needed, even internationally. My credit union's webpage interface was always a problem trying to log onto, but I haven't had that problem with Ally Bank's easy to use customer interface system. I think that's really been the highlight for one, having everything in one place that is easy to use, and I don't have to stop at a physical location somewhere to check a balance like I used to. I've also had a fairly decent return rate on the money I've put into a money market account with Ally Bank, even in this time of record low interest rates. I couldn't be any happier with my experience with Ally bank, especially the one time I had a fraudulent charge that was easily handled by their customer service department.",2016-12-27
1156,Good experience,25997,277,Ally Bank,35010,5,"I found Ally Bank to be innovative. It allowed people desiring a different way of banking the opportunity of a little more freedom. I love the deposit feature. You take a picture of your check and send it off to them, then seeing it in your account within seconds is great. I don't remember ever feeling like I needed someone to talk to in person. For questions and inquiries about any issue, chat, email or phone was always available. I think you can get as much info that way as you would in person. I didn't have an IRA, but my savings and general banking needs were met. I especially appreciated fraud protection. I was traveling one year and I received a message from the bank to let me know that money was being used in another country. They were on the ball about fraud.",2016-12-24
1157,Ally Review,25992,277,Ally Bank,35006,5,"Ally is an incredible bank. Their customer service is by far the best I have ever encountered when dealing with banks. Because they're not spending money on leases, they're able to invest in customer service and it really shows. Additionally, they give me an incredible interest on both my checking and savings. Overall, Ally is an amazing bank. All the money they have saved has been invested into making your experience as a customer amazing and it truly shows.",2016-12-23
1158,Modern Banking,25991,277,Ally Bank,35005,5,"I started banking with Ally a couple of years ago on the recommendation of a coworker. I chose to get a savings account through Ally because they have an unbeatable interest rate. With my brick-and-mortar bank, I was getting less than .05% interest. The interest earnings get deposited monthly, so the interest compounds, and it also really encourages me to save more. Ally charges me zero service fees for having my savings account, and there is no minimum balance required for the specific account type I have. Transfers to my other bank accounts are easy and take only 2-3 days maximum. Ally's customer support is really great, too. Every time I have ever needed to call them, the wait time was a minute or less to get to a service representative. I cannot say enough good things about this bank, and I will be establishing more accounts with them in the future.",2016-12-22
1159,Love the service ,25983,277,Ally Bank,34994,4,"I have been an Ally Bank customer for about 6 months and I could not be happier. My savings and checking accounts have provided me better service that my other physical banks. Both accounts earn me interest that is more than my Wells Fargo and Chase account, and I have not had any issues transferring money from them into my Ally accounts. In fact, my checking account from Ally Bank earns more than my Wells Fargo savings account! Six transfers from my other banks a month to my Ally accounts is more than sufficient, and I can find a nearby ATM that are fee-free, but I get $10 a month in ATM fees credit anyway. When I do have a question, I can either call or chat. The alert of hold time on the clean, and easy to navigate web site is normally 0 to 1 minute of wait time, but chat is just as efficient in getting my question answered. I love Ally Bank.",2016-12-22
1160,Ally is great,25979,277,Ally Bank,34989,4,"One day I was looking to sign up with a new online bank because I don't like dealing with banks in person. I signed up for Ally because they had the highest interest rates for checking and savings accounts, so I would be getting a little extra free money with that. I've been with them for several years now and haven't had any problems. If I want to transfer money from my savings to checking, or checking to savings, it takes like 30 seconds. I have it set up so every other week, $50 gets transferred from my other bank to my Ally bank to use for car insurance. I really like that I'm able to set up this automatic transfer with Ally so I don't have to deal with doing it myself.",2016-12-20
1161,The future of banking,25964,277,Ally Bank,34955,5,"I have been an Ally Bank account holder for about 5 years. It was my first experience with an ""internet"" bank, so I was a little skeptical at first, but the relatively high interest rates for online savings accounts piqued my interest. So, I started with a relatively small deposit from money that was sitting in my savings account at one of the big national banks earning a few cents in interest each month. Setting up the account and making the first deposit was easy and intuitive. Ally's website is easy to use and there are many options for transferring money, paying bills, and other things from the website. Before long, I had transferred most of my liquid savings to Ally and was earning much more in interest than at my other savings account. My experience at Ally has been mostly without any issues, but in cases where something has come up -- for example, I recently got locked out of my account because I forgot my username/password and had a new computer -- I have always received quick and friendly customer service. I'm a happy customer and plan to be an Ally account holder for a long time.",2016-12-20
1162,Best Bank I've ever used!,25878,277,Ally Bank,34749,5,"Ally is more than just an ally when it comes to banking. They do everything that a great bank should. You are always greeted by a real person, who is always very pleasant. I cannot say Ive ever waited more than 5 minutes to speak to a rep. <br/> <br/>The banking itself is even better, which is hard to do. They replace all ATM fees each month, since they do not have any of their own. They offer competitive rates on CDs, and their high yield interest savings accounts are hard to beat. They offer great interest rates that help you save and grow your money. I would recommend Ally to anyone who is in need of a quality bank. They truly cannot be beat!",2016-12-16
1163,Amazing rates. Awesome Service,25873,277,Ally Bank,34743,5,"Ally is probably one of the best banks around. The interest on their savings accounts is above average. They have no minimums and no hoops to jump through. And they also have no fees! Checking also gets great interest on checking with a debt card. You get reimbursed up to $10 on ATM fees. Customer service is also top notch. They have a wait timer on their website showing how long it will take to talk to someone and it's never such a long wait. Lastly, they provided fast and friendly service.",2016-12-15
1164,Great Customer Service and Price Point,25793,277,Ally Bank,34574,5,"I love using Ally as my bank. I have moved a few times and never have to worry about where I should be banking. I can easily deposit checks through their mobile app, so I don't have to worry about driving to a bank to do a deposit. Their customer service is great and every time I have called I have gotten in touch with a rep very quickly. They also make it easy to open up multiple accounts. I have 3 checking and 1 savings. It doesn't cost me any more to do it. Did I mention, free ATM usage! There are a few downsides. If you get cash as payment, there is not an easy way to put it in your bank account. Also, when you deposit a large check, it takes multiple days for the funds to fully get into your account. Overall though, they are a great option.",2016-12-08
1165,Great online bank if you have money sitting in a savings account.,25781,277,Ally Bank,34561,5,"This bank is a great alternative to traditional banks in that the interest rates they provide are literally one hundred times better. I had some money set aside in a traditional bank accruing less than .01% interest. I did not feel that investing this money was wise, as I would need it at some point for emergency funds. I felt that the interest I was receiving was nonexistent. I decided to try one of the online banks that provided more interest and could not be happier. It has been a really easy transition to Ally. Transferring the money was painless and only took a few days. The times I needed to pull money out, the withdrawal was also painless and I saw the money in my account within days. I, personally, have not needed to withdraw money from my account from a physical ATM as of yet, but I assume there will be no problems as they are very helpful in the online chats.",2016-12-07
1166,I love ally,25778,277,Ally Bank,34558,5,"I really do love Ally bank. They are always available to talk, and they realize I am not just some customer. Sure, they send some new product info, but I dont get tons of advertisments for their products. They have the highest rates around, and without fees, or minimum balances. Some other banks try to give a minimum account of $1,000 for the same interest as you get at Ally if you deposit say $5. I also love how easy it is for me to move money to say a CD / or other feature. I started using Ally as a second bank, as it wouldn't be so easy to withdraw money, but ended up using as my main bank. THANKS!!!",2016-12-06
1167,"Ally bank saves me money on fees, and I get cash back",25770,277,Ally Bank,34550,5,"I signed up for an Ally account 2 years ago, and have been thrilled with both the account services and the customer service. There are no monthly maintenance fees (and no minimum or direct deposit requirements to waive fees), the debit card gives me 1% cash back on all purchases, and I am not charged for replacement checks. I am also not charged a fee for using other banks' ATMs, and get up to $10 reimbursed per month for ATM fees. Just last week, while on vacation, I used three different ATM machines - the total fees should have been about $8, but Ally reimbursed me for all of the fees. As if no fees weren't enough, I also get great interest for my savings account, and checking. Plus, I love the ability to deposit funds using my iPad/iPhone camera and the Ally app; it makes the whole thing a lot more convenient. My only caution would be to keep a close eye on your account, because overdraft fees (without transfer) are $25 per paid item, so a few math mistakes could add up quickly to a lot of fees. Last, but not least, the customer service is great. When I had an issue with my account a few weeks ago, I was able to get a representative on chat in under a minute, and my questions were answered politely and correctly. Like I said, love this bank!",2016-12-05
1168,Great Choice for Online Banking,25674,277,Ally Bank,34297,4,"I signed up for an Ally Bank checking account so I could have a place to conveniently store money I make online. I tried linking my regular bank account to my Amazon account, but it kept getting rejected. However, my Ally account linked instantly. Now I can get access to my online earnings as quickly as one day after I transfer them to my Ally account.<br/> <br/>When I signed up with Ally, they also sent me a checkbook and a debit card. I can use the card at a wide variety of ATM's, many near my home. I do have to pay a fee at some of the machines, but Ally offers ATM fee reimbursement. I have not had to use that service yet, but I'm glad to have it.<br/> <br/>Ally's checking accounts are perfect for those who earn money through services like Paypal or Amazon Payments. I highly recommend them.",2016-11-30
1169,Great place to keep some cash,25656,277,Ally Bank,34231,4,I have been banking with Ally Bank for just about a year now and I only wish I had found them sooner. They offer a very competitive rate on their savings account and you don't find that in too many places. Their rate on an interest bearing savings account is pretty much the best deal out there. They also offer you easy access to your money. There is no penalty for withdrawals and there is no minimum amount that you need to keep in the account. It is a much better offering that a lot of other banks where you need to keep a minimum amount and you do not earn a decent amount of interest. Transferring funds is very easy with the click of a few buttons and you have access to your account via their website at anytime.,2016-11-29
1170,Great no frills online checking,25633,277,Ally Bank,34195,5,"Ally bank provides a great online checking account. The opening process was easy and smooth. The customer service representative that assisted me on the phone with setting up the account was patient, kind and friendly. She made it easy to understand. They have very competitive rates, especially if you will be carrying a large balance and there are no fees. There were no local banks that provided that. They also have 24/7 customer service which is great for me as I work second shift and normal banking hours are difficult for me. I had a check to deposit and was having trouble with the app where you can deposit the check through photo and again had to call customer service and was only on the phone moments with a very friendly person. I don't use ATMs often but I have my fees reimbursed if I do! I couldn't be happier with this bank.",2016-11-28
1171,Excellent bank! Very pleased.,25589,277,Ally Bank,34102,4,"I have a checking account with Ally Bank. I originally got the account because the setup process was so easy and simple - all I had to do was fill out some information on a website! Although there's no physical bank to go to, withdrawing money is easy. They don't charge ATM fees and refund up to $10 a month of ATM fees charged on the other end. Depositing checks is super simple - just take a picture. I've had my card information stolen a couple times, and Ally was helpful with that as well. They refunded my money and sent me a new card. My one complaint would be that it took a while (a couple weeks, I think) to get my new card, and in the meantime the only way I had to access my money was through checks. So, I recommend having a backup physical bank! But for the rest of the time, great experience.",2016-11-22
1172,Ally offers the best Online Savings Account,25570,277,Ally Bank,34045,5,I use Ally bank as an offsite/online savings account that is separate from my household checking account. The moble and web functionality and features has made me consider completely switching over from my local bank. Mobile Phone app allows for e-deposits which allows you to take a photo of your check and deposit it without having to go to a physical location. Overall the mobile app is easy to use and can be linked with any outside bank accounts for transfers with ease. Definitely a great decision choosing Ally for my online savings account!,2016-11-21
1173,Too Slow In Processing Transactions.,25668,277,Ally Bank,34273,1,"It takes Ally far too long to process and post all types of transactions when compared to other banks I've used. This is especially true of mobile check deposit. 4-7 days to process a deposit is virtually useless to me. Also, the mobile app is glitchy.

1174,"Great Experience, Totally Recommend",25646,277,Ally Bank,34220,4,"I started banking with Ally Bank a little more than a year ago and was hesitant to use an online only bank. I was worried about not being able to customer service when I needed to, but working with and using Ally completely erased my fears. Deposits are fast and easy using the Ally Mobile Banking app on my phone. I have occasionally used their over-the-phone customer service and has always been taken care of well. I chose Ally because the rates they had on CDs were better than the rates that I could have gotten at brick-and-mortar banks. I'm also pleased with the way you can use ATMs and get reimbursed for any fees they charge, and that you can also use many ATMs across the country without incurring any fees. Overall, I will continue banking with Ally because it is convenient, their customer service is excellent, and I am very happy with the rates they offer.",2016-11-18
1175,"Easy to Use, getting on with life",25514,277,Ally Bank,33936,4,"Ally is the easiest banking experience I have ever had. Everything is in one place. For basic Checking and Savings accounts, they are very easy to access. My favorite part is being able to use any ATM in the country and Ally pays the fees. I can do everything from my phone to make things as convenient as possible using their easy-to-use app. The interest rates they have with the Savings account is very competitive with the rest of the market. If I ever have to speak to someone with any issues, the 24/7 customer service with a real person is a nice touch. They have the option of using other services such as opening an IRA or needing a credit card directly through them. I will continue using them for a very long time.",2016-11-16

I encountered a number of issues involving their locations and the services there. Worst of all, I had a really horrible APY rate. It was worse than inflation. I switched over to Ally Bank when I found out how competitive their rates were comparitively. I've had a great experience with their online and mobile apps, especially since that is their forte. They really put effort into. Their customer service is available 24/7, which is really nice, however, I wish that the service people would be a little easier to work with. It also took a while to reach someone when I used their service. All and all they are a pretty good bank that offer really amazing APY to those looking to save more.",2016-11-14

I like the app, it functions well and makes it easy to submit transfers, edit transfers, and deposit checks. It does take several days for deposited checks to show up. It is faster at my local bank. I do wish that transfers between this bank and my local bank were faster. It takes 2-3 business days, not long by bank standards, I guess. But since I make 1 transfer between these banks every month, I wish they would sync and transfers could go faster. I like that on the app, it shows how long your wait time would be if you needed to call. It's normally 1 or 2 minutes. I don't think I've ever seen it longer than 2 minutes.",2016-11-14
1178,Checking And Savings Account Customer,25575,277,Ally Bank,34056,1,"I also opened my Ally account due to the high interest rate. My husband and I closed our other accounts and decided to just use Ally. HUGE MISTAKE. I'm reopening an account at my old bank first thing on Monday.<br/>My husband has direct deposit and this has been working fine. I unfortunately don't have direct deposit at my job so I must deposit my actual check. It takes WAY too long for my check to clear. Their check deposit times leave a lot to be desired. My last check was deposited on a Thursday and I didn't have access to my money until Monday. You have to wait for TWO business days after the day of deposit until they let you have YOUR money. Absolutely ridiculous.<br/>I hate that you can't deposit cash or even a money order. They also got rid of refunding all your ATM fees and will only reimburse you up to $10. Classic bait and switch.<br/>Things were going okay until two weeks ago. My husband and I went on a 10 day vacation. I admit that I forgot to tell them that we were leaving, so we weren't that surprised when they shut off my husband's card... 8 DAYS INTO OUR TRIP!!!! But mine was not shut off. Really good security you got going on there, Ally...<br/>That night at the hotel we spent (more like wasted) half an hour on the phone with Ally to alert them we were out of town.<br/>Two days later, we were making a mad dash for the airport and ended up with a shady cab driver who would only accept cash. While waiting for the cab, my husband tried to get money out of the ATM but neither of our cards worked. I called Ally THREE times to see if there was a problem. They kept telling me there was no problem. So we had the cab driver take us to an ATM, again it didn't work! I called Ally AGAIN and then they decide to tell me there was some kind of dumb hold on our account. Needless to say, we missed our flight and had to spend an extra $300 on a hotel, food, cabs, etc. Thanks a lot Ally!!! <br/>Then today, I needed to take a significant amount of cash from the ATM ($1200). They have a $1000 daily ATM limit. I called to see if they could increase that for me. Nope. He said they could put in a request to increase it but that would take TWO business days. It's my freaking money!! The Ally rep told me to wait until exactly midnight, or maybe I have a friend who owns a business and would let me charge my card and get the cash! WTF?? Um no!!! Luckily my husband was able to use his Ally card and get the remainder of the funds I needed out of the SAME ACCOUNT!!! Wish that idiot would've told me that over the phone. <br/>Anyway, waaaaay too much BS. My 1% interest was more than blown on the garbage this bank has thrown at me.

1179,"Ally is the best for interest bearing, no fee banking!",25450,277,Ally Bank,33807,5,"Simply put, Ally is an incredible place for online banking. There are zero fees for transfers and ATM transactions. I know what you're thinking - what about the ATM fees that machines automatically charge? Ally reimburses those fees every single month. What's more, Ally accounts bear interest. All of them, even checking. Savings interest bears more, of course, but it's still impressive that their checking also bears interest. And without a minimum balance! Simply have your paycheck direct deposited and you're taken care of. Their app is also ever-improving and depositing checks is a breeze. Simply sign, take a picture, and you're done. The only drawback is there is no easy way to deposit cash. But how often do you need to do that? If the answer is ""quite often"" then maybe this isn't the bank for you. Otherwise, this is DEFINITELY the bank for you.",2016-11-07
1180,Great Savings Product,25434,277,Ally Bank,33774,5,I have used Allly banks savings account for many years. I think they are fantastic. They have better rates than any other bank I have seen especially banks with brick and mortar branches. In this day and age there really is no need for access to a bank in person. Their website is fantastic and has everything you would expect and then some. It is fast and well designed. Their mobile apps are also great and are available for both iOS and Android. You can do all of your banking from your phone and can link to your checking account at other banks. I have had to contact customer service several times and each time they were extremely helpful. The waiting time is always short. You also will receive an ATM card so if you must get cash out quickly you have the option. Overall I really have no complaint about using an internet only bank in Ally.,2016-11-03
1181,Better interest rate than anything local!,25421,277,Ally Bank,33746,4,"I have been familiar with Ally since I started shopping for an account for my brother. No local savings accounts were offering anything in terms of interest, and he was offered much higher interest at Ally. There has never been a problem with getting his money transferred to another account, and he has never had any trouble getting his money out. The time period for transferring his money has always been much quicker than they advertise. We have been so happy with Ally that we have convinced our mother to put her savings there also! Their website is easy to use and won't confuse the elderly. My mother is shocked that she banks online! All in all, Ally bank is a winner with this family!",2016-11-01

The first time I decided to sign up for Ally, it was offering a checking account/savings account combo, with the APY being .10% and 1%, respectively. Sure, my Capital One 360 account offered good interest (.2% for checking, .75% for savings), but Ally also went further with excellent 3 or 4-year CDs. I opened my very first CD as an adult with Ally Bank, signing up for its ""Raise Your Rate"" 4-year CD at 1.4% APY. I started with these three products over a year ago, and today I have 3 more tacked on: another 4-year CD that's also an IRA, a 3-year high-yield CD at 1.5%, and an IRA Savings Account that I can add to as much as I want. Ally's website and mobile app are easy-to-use, sleek, and consistent. I've never had issues logging in or navigating around. I like how Ally's savings account can be set up as overdraft protection in increments of $100. I try to keep $200 in it at all times to catch any pesky little overdrafts. This also encourages me to keep money in to earn interest. Basically, Ally Bank's offers and interface have encouraged me to save money, which is something I've struggled with over the years. I've set up bill pay for a couple of my credit cards that I use mostly for everyday spending as well as fun things like trips or dining out. I've connected an AMEX card to it, as well as Ally's own Visa that they just introduced (but that's a different product, so I won't say anything about it here). What would be great is if Ally could connect its own Visa as overdraft protection, which other banks can do but Ally does not. Even Capital One 360 has a built-in overdraft line of credit with extremely low interest. Of course, it's always better to use back-up cash like the Ally savings account, but for peace of mind a connected credit card couldn't hurt. I have to say I have't been hit with really any fees by Ally, other than ATM fees-- which get refunded to me if I only go the ATM a couple times per billing cycle. So Ally has done nothing but earn me money, and that's why I still use it and intend to continue using it for many years. Overall it's an excellent online banking product.",2016-10-31
1183,Ally Bank Review,25380,277,Ally Bank,33667,4,"My experience with Ally bank had been pretty descent so far. There is only one thing that I don't like. I don't like the fact that when I get charged for using an ATM from anywhere, they don't credit my account back the charge fee until the next statement cycle. I wish that process was immediate. I chose Ally because of it's lack of fees on ATM's and monthly fees. Not having to deal with fees just to store my money there is great. The customer service is fantastic. I was looking for a good secure account to start saving a little extra money every. I figured a good online only bank would work fine for a savings account.",2016-10-28
1184,Ally Bank is Great,25382,277,Ally Bank,33669,5,"When I was looking for an online bank, I researched and came upon Ally Bank as one of the top online banking institutions. Their free interest checking account convinced me to open an account. Sign-up was very simple. You're not required to put an initial deposit when signing up which was another plus. I was able to open the interest checking account and then place my first deposit with them the next day. The introductory packet that comes in the mail a few days later, comes with some deposit slips in case you want to send in a deposit and a note that states that I was to receive my debit card within 10 business days of making my first transaction and I received it in 5 business days which definitely was nice. The purchases I make with my debit card show up in my transaction history online almost immediately. I had a pleasant experience utilizing the chat feature. I was chatting with someone within 10 seconds of clicking the link to chat. I have yet to try calling in to actually speak to a representative, but I'm sure this experience would be just as pleasant an experience as the one I had chatting. I say that because on the top left of the web page, it states the phone number to call to speak to someone and right underneath the number, the approximate wait time. That, to me, is a plus because when you're busy and you need to get things done, it's good to know exactly how much of a wait you're going to have to deal with before you actually place the call. All in all, so far, I've had a great experience with Ally Bank, and I believe I will have a great relationship with them in the years to come.",2016-10-28
1185,Online Banking that Makes Sense,25347,277,Ally Bank,33588,4,"I have had a checking and savings account at Ally Bank for several years now. They both provide interest way about what a normal brick and mortar bank location gives today. Even though they do not have a physical location, customer service has been excellent. I can chat with a bank representative online or get a hold of one on the phone in a matter of about a minute. I called them last night at 3 a.m. because I was having trouble with a paypal deposit that was getting rejected and they were able to resolve that in a few minutes. The person on the other end has always been able to answer my questions or help me out with whatever I need. Depositing checks via their mobile app is a breeze and beats having to go to a physical bank and make a deposit. Their debit card is a Visa card, so it is accepted pretty much everywhere.",2016-10-24
1186,Great experience,25322,277,Ally Bank,33538,5,"I initially chose Ally because they appeared to have the highest interest rate of all the online banks. When I started the process, I found the website to be very use friendly- it was easy to find the info I was looking for and the information was presented in a clear and easy to understand way. My experience with customer service was great. There was little to no wait time on the phone, they were friendly, and they answered my questions and concerns about opening my account. Now I'm accessing the website to view statements and I continue to feel that Ally was the right choice. Super user friendly, good rates, and I always feel confident that I can reach out and get help when I need it.",2016-10-21
1187,Reasons I Love Banking With Ally,25317,277,Ally Bank,33533,5,"I have been banking with Ally bank exclusively for the past five years. I was skeptical of using an online bank at first, but now I will never go back to ""brick and mortar"". Here are some of the things I love about Ally: (1) Open 24/7. (2) Has a really good app for your smartphone. (3) Free checks. (4) Postage paid deposit envelopes and check registers. (5) Online Bill Pay that gets your payment where it needs to be, when it needs to be there (I have never had a payment show up late!). (6) Popmoney lets you send money to anyone who has an e-mail account (I use it all the time to send money to my nieces). (7) Super easy to deposit ""paper"" checks remotely. (8) ATM fees are reimbursed to your account monthly (up to $10.00), so you basically never pay an ATM fee! Ally also offers Overdraft Transfer Service, which means if you accidentally overdraw your checking account (oops!), they will transfer funds, in $100 increments, from your savings account. Love this, and it has saved me a couple of times! I have really never had to use customer service, so I can't comment on that. Ally is a bank that is always improving and finding new ways to make their customers' banking experience more efficient, and less costly.",2016-10-21
1188,Great Bank!,25265,277,Ally Bank,33441,4,"I have been really happy with Ally Bank. The website is super easy to use and user friendly. Customer service is pretty good too. One time I accidentally locked myself out of my account, and I called customer service. The representative I spoke with was more than understanding and walked me through the steps to get back into my account. I've also talked to them about my account and what options I had for investments, specifically IRAs. I was able to speak with someone at the bank that was very knowledgeable and she even took the time to send me an information packet so I could more easily review my options. She didn't make me feel stupid or talk down to me. I am very happy with this bank! I initially used this bank to handle my savings account, but now have other accounts there as well. I would recommend them to anyone!",2016-10-17
1189,Satisfied Customer,25242,277,Ally Bank,33394,5,"Just this evening I called customer service and did not have to stay on hold for very long before a friendly, upbeat young woman came on the line and assisted me with my call. She made sure I understood what she told me and that I didn't have any further questions before wishing me a good rest of the week and making sure that I knew that customer service can be reached 24/7. I couldn't have had a better experience. I love this bank.",2016-10-14
1190,Competitive rates and low fees- Ally is on your side,25223,277,Ally Bank,33345,5,"Ally Bank does an amazing job fixing the two biggest shortcomings of major banks. Because they are online only and don't have to deal with the overhead costs of running branches, they can afford to be very generous to customers. This comes out in two major ways. First of all, they reimburse all atm fees. No more running halfway across the city to avoid a $3 charge every time you need cash. Find ANY ATM near you, and they will credit the fee back to your account. Also, they offer some incredibly competitive interest rates. Most major banks offer low fractions of a percent, such that your money actually loses value when adjusted for inflation. While Ally might not be the most rewarding place to stash your money long term, they do at least give you something by paying 0.6% interest rate on online checking accounts. Their CDs also offer interest rates above 1%, making them an ideal choice for online banking.",2016-10-13
1191,Great bank and great interest rates,25219,277,Ally Bank,33341,5,"I have had a great experience with Ally Bank. I opened my account because they have very competitive interest rate on savings accounts, and I'm so glad I did. My savings account, which I've had for over a year, is still earning 1% interest. I have only had a couple minor issues with this bank, and both of them were resolved quickly. I'm working on switching all of my checking over to Ally, but because of a number of automatic payments made from my current checking account it has been a slow process and in the mean time it's a 3 business day wait to transfer money from my checking to savings or vice versa.",2016-10-13
1192,Can't Make Cash Desposits. At All.,25212,277,Ally Bank,32086,1,"Ally refuses to partner with any other banks or ATMs so that it's customers can make cash deposits. Instead, you have to go and create a money order and then mail that in. Nope. Not customer-minded all. Just a huge inefficient waste of time. Skip this ""bank.""",2016-10-13
1193,Ally is the Best Online Bank,25204,277,Ally Bank,33320,5,"I love Ally Bank because I have had such great customer service from them and because they do not charge any fees. I sometimes suffer from that old-age disease of forgetting my password. With Ally customer service: no problem calling and getting it re-set. Customer service agents have always been patient with me, even if a mistake was my fault (like forgetting I had written a check). Instead of the check bouncing, Ally covered it with my savings account, and did not charge me what other banks do ($35, and the sting of bouncing). I also earn a decent percentage interest on both my interest checking and savings account.",2016-10-12
1194,My time spent with Ally,25170,277,Ally Bank,33264,4,"I've used a couple online banks before, such as USAA for example, so I have at least medium expectations when it comes to Customer Service and ease of use. Ally bank met if not exceeded most of my expectations. To start with, their customer service is reliable and fast. I've had a couple problems with payment processors, even when visiting other countries (Denmark for example) outside of the United States, I contacted them via their webchat, they told me to call ASAP. Couple minutes later I was talking to a real person, getting my situation sorted. I think I spent maybe 10 minutes on the whole ordeal, from the moment of realizing it wasn't working to getting it sorted out.<br/> <br/>Their ease of use with mobile banking was amazing, being able to deposit checks years ago with a cell phone picture before other banks were even doing this. I've noticed Ally is still very fast with the deposits, most taking 3 days at maximum, never longer. Combine this with their mobile App, I found it very comfortable to use them anywhere I went that had internet.<br/> <br/>I think if someone wants to try out online banking, they should give Ally a try, especially if they have a smart phone. Customer service was some of the best I've seen in a long time.",2016-10-10
1195,Awful Ally,25158,277,Ally Bank,33235,1,"What a nightmare! Their fraud department is just incompetent. They block everything, but the bank still takes out the money and then takes 10 days to return it. Dealing with customer service is frustrating at best, and it's just a very unprofessional and unreliable bank. Don't be sucked in by the low fees, you get what you pay for.",2016-10-09
1196,Now I Understand Peoples Frustration With Ally,25109,277,Ally Bank,26302,1,"I have been with Ally since they were known as GMAC bank or about 7 years. Never had any issues with them. My problems began when I tried to link my account with an external account. The other bank lists their MM as a MM savings. When I set up the bank link I set it up as a MM Savings. The micro deposits made it to my account but Ally was not able to withdraw them. Never notified about this issue by Ally. I called customer service and they said that they will try the account linking again. Once again same results. The micro deposits make it to my external account but Ally was not able to withdraw them, and just like before no notice from Ally about this issue. I called Ally to find out what is going on and they now demanded that I provide them with a letter from the other bank on that banks letterhead with my full name, address, bank account number, and routing number to prove my account ownership. I called the other bank with this request and they declined citing security reasons and for my protection. The CS agent suggested I submit the account opening letter as proof of account ownership. I verified my account number with them, confirmed the ACH routing number, and asked her what type of account was their MM. Savings or checking? The CS agent informed me that it is in fact a MM Checking not a MM savings unlike what is advertised.<br/><br/>With this information I called Ally. I informed them about what the other bank told me. They once again demanded that I provide them with the credentials they told me about regardless of the issue. I sent them the account opening letter and a letter informing them about what is blocking the ACH transfer. Two days go by and no reply from Ally. I called them again, they stated that they have not received anything from me yet. They ask me to resend the information. Two days go by no reply from Ally. On the third day a call from Ally that they do not have the information they expected from me. I informed them that I sent it twice. Informed them that my email does not have my name, to look for my email address instead. After almost an hour on the telephone the CS agent informs me that the information I sent is not what they asked for and that they will not unlock the account for me to re-link them until I provide what they demand. This back and forth nonsense has been going on since August 17. Today October 3 was the final straw. I even requested to speak to a supervisor about this a week ago, I received a case number but never heard back from a supervisor. Let me mention that the CS agents at Ally are wonderful and they are not the problem. They were very frustrated that they could not help me. The people causing all the stalemate are the back office accounts transfer group. I have never experienced such a draconian mentality for such a simple problem. In frustration I have decided to close all my accounts with Ally and terminate my banking relationship with them.",2016-10-04
1197,Best savings account rate,24976,277,Ally Bank,32861,5,"I was looking for a savings account where I could put some money that I had left over on my checking account but upon checking most banks they offered extremely low Annual Percentage Yield which pretty much meant my money would just be sitting there earning nothing. I heard about Ally bank after searching online but had a lot of questions. I went to the bank's website and had the opportunity to chat with a customer specialist who pretty much walked me through the whole process and answered all my questions. It was good to have someone there since this is an account that you have to be approved for. Now, I am able to easily transfer my money to this account easily and earn 1% which is unheard of compared to any other bank.",2016-09-21
1198,Great online bank,24780,277,Ally Bank,32348,5,"I joined Ally bank because of the competitive interest rates. It did not disappoint. I love it. I can deposit checks from the mobile app. It takes several days for the money to show up in the account. I use Ally Bank for my savings account. I have been banking with them for about 4 years now. I have had no issues. When I use the app, there's a button that tells me how long my wait time would be if I needed to call. It's always there! It's usually 1-2 minutes. The best wait time ever! Thanks Ally!",2016-08-24
1199,Ally Bank: The No-Frills Online Bank,24738,277,Ally Bank,32235,4,"Ally Bank is a neat little online bank with no-frills and no fees for savings accounts. If you're looking to put a little money away at a great interest rate, and you don't mind dealing with electronic funds, then it's perfect. Unfortunately, should you need any customer service, the person on the other end of the phone call is pretty much just reading from a script, and can't offer you too much in the way of personalized service. If you're a low-maintenance customer, though, Ally offers competitive interest rates and an easy-to-use website, making electronic deposits and withdrawals very simple, as well as offering deposits of paper checks. I've only had to call customer service once, and was very disappointed the employee couldn't tell me why a check I sent in wasn't accepted, but other than that, I usually find it so simple to make deposits and check my balance at the click of a few buttons. Ally's phone app is very similar to the website, and gives you the same basic information you'll find online. When I need to deposit a paper check, I just scan the front, scan the back, and upload the images. The funds generally appear in my account the next day, and the interest shows up once a month. As long as you don't need anyone to hold your hand, Ally is a fabulous online bank that allows me a lot more customer control than many brick and mortar banks.",2016-08-19
1200,Really Satisfied,24689,277,Ally Bank,32141,5,"I was recommended to Ally by my mother, who was recommended by her friend and coworker. I signed up with Ally because of their very competitive interest rate for a savings account, with zero fees. I have only ever had to call their customer service once (with a question regarding setting up my account), and the lady who helped me was great. They are a great online bank with great rates. Their website is aesthetically pleasing, and I have never had a single issue with deposits, withdraws, or transfers. It usually takes three to five days to transfer in and out of my Ally savings account to my regular (other bank) checking account. Honestly, it is usually only ever three days, and only takes five days if I start the transfer on a Friday or Sunday. The interest deposits monthly and it is nice to see that little ""bonus"" every month, like a little reminder that your money is working FOR YOU for once.",2016-08-15
1201,Great bank for long-term savings,24601,277,Ally Bank,31992,5,"I've had an account with Ally bank for a year or so now. I use it for long-term savings. If I ever come into a larger sum (such as my taxes), I throw it into my ally saving's account. 1% interest is the best I've found besides a CD or other, similar products. The only cons I've experienced is that it's difficult to get money in and out. Make sure you have enough time for a bank transfer, because it can take a few days. Other than that, it's been a great bank. All my experiences have been positive, and their mobile app is very useful. I have recently added their card to Samsung Pay, which is nice because my other bank does not allow use on Samsung Pay. I have yet to use it; however, I'll be excited to try it.",2016-08-08
1202,Good For Simple Savings Needs,24574,277,Ally Bank,31946,4,"I have been with Ally a few years now, ever since they got off the ground with their creative commercials. I was interested in seeking out a bank that had an online savings account. The savings account is all I ever opened with Ally, and I have used it frequently since. It has been great for specific deposits from PayPal or other online selling accounts, but I found using it was hard because it added an extra step to get the money in my own primary checking account at a local bank. I love the concept of having an online savings account with an online bank, because there are less fees and less need to be in touch with a person. Ally really does have a good product for simple savings needs.",2016-08-05
1203,Not Recommended,24477,277,Ally Bank,31720,1,"I have been using Ally for 2+ years. At first things worked great but over the past six months have had several issues with them including significant delays in processing deposits. I have tried to get these issues resolved with customer service who has been unhelpful and could not resolve any of the issues. This used to be a great bank. Changes in their processes and fees as well as that now depositing money takes close to 7 business days for the money to be credited to your account, unacceptable. I would not recommend this bank to anyone.",2016-07-25
1204,A Great Alternative,24390,277,Ally Bank,31486,5,"I have had ally bank for 3 years and my experience with them has been great. The reason I chose Ally was their savings rates. I had a fairly large amount of money I needed to keep on hand but didn't need to touch for a while, and I was tired of earning pennies a month when I could be earning dollars. Since joining Ally, I have not been charged any of the ridiculous fees my brick and mortar bank tries to add on to accounts. After about a year of having a savings account at ally, I decided to open a CD and had a question. I was helped quickly by a knowledgeable customer service rep. One of the best things about their CD accounts is there is no minimum amount Their raise your rate feature is great because if the interest rate goes up you can lock into a higher rate! If you are looking for an alternative bank or secondary bank, Ally would be a great choice.",2016-07-14
1205,Great Online Banking Experience,24349,277,Ally Bank,31394,5,"I have been a customer of Ally bank for over 5 years now. I opened a checking account with them when I left Wells Fargo due to being unsatisfied with the service, and I have not looked back. Ally is very convenient for me to use. Though I cannot go to a branch to get help, I am able to do anything through their online interface. I can look at my statements, pay bills, send money to individuals, transfer money, and even deposit checks without ever meeting anyone face to face. In order to deposit checks, all I need to do is take a few photos of the check with my phone and submit it through their mobile application. The most convenient feature for me is the ability to use any ATM machine without a fee. Ally will reimburse any fees incurred by using an ATM to withdrawal cash. I have never been charged any fees of any sort and would recommend Ally to anyone looking for an online bank.",2016-07-11
1206,Strange Happenings At Ally Bank,24295,277,Ally Bank,27551,3,"I popped for the $250 bonus for opening a 50K IRA account with Ally earlier in the year. They're supposed to post the bonus at the end of this month. However, they just sent me an email stating that I would be getting a $100 bonus. <br/><br/>I gave them a call and they agreed that the email was in error. I told them that they need to find-out how this mistake was made and send me an email acknowedging it. However, the CSR I talked with didn't have the authority to send emails!<br/><br/>So, I'm waiting for a reply back from the powers that be at Ally. This is something they really need to fix before the end of the month. Hopefully, this is just an email issue and they'll post the correct bonus amount later in the month.<br/><br/>If they don't get back to me within a week, I plan on escalating the issue. I don't want to have to deal with them posting the wrong amount and then have to straighten that mess out after the fact. This isn't much of a confidence builder, is it?",2016-07-05
1207,Really happy with Ally bank,24264,277,Ally Bank,31156,4,"I've had a checking account with Ally for about two years, and I've been very happy with them. I've had no problems, and the checking account pays interest, which is nice. The website is clean, simple, and I've never run into any sort of glitch or problem on it. I particularly like the online check deposit option. I've used it a couple of times and was impressed by how quick and easy it was. Also, the fact that it went through in spite of my scan being less than perfect was an added bonus! I can't really say anything about customer service since I haven't had to use it! It's nice to have a checking account that is convenient, problem-free, and doesn't try to gouge me for extra fees at every opportunity. I definitely recommend it.",2016-06-30
1208,They Blame Customers For Their Deception And Take No Responsibility. AVOID,24241,277,Ally Bank,31104,1,"Ally Bank has incredibly deceptive business practices. <br/><br/>In one example, they advertise FREE international transfers, only to have their intermediary bank (Chase), assess fees. Since Ally forces customers to internationally transfer THROUGH Chase, Ally is therefore charging fees, but they never warn of this or take any responsibility. Instead of understanding this, Ally pushes me to contact chase directly, who I am not a customer of nor care to be. They blame me and take no responsibility. <br/><br/>The only course of action after speaking to representatives? I would need to MAIL or FAX a report to their banking team - they claim they have no email or secured messaging (lie) support to do this, despite being an online-only bank. <br/><br/>Their website is full of deceptive marketing and probably fake reviews and ratings. I wouldn't touch this bank. And this is just one example of many that I have had since opening my account with them 3 months ago.",2016-06-27

Ally offers a ton of features that other banks charge you a fee for, but Ally includes them for free. Not to mention it is the only online bank I have found that will offer you a free checking account that gains interest over time. Yes, I said their free checking account gains interest where as other banks you are lucky to just get a free checking account. On top of that, they also offer some of the highest yielding interest on basic savings accounts as well.<br/> <br/>I can always count on getting the correct answer from them to all my questions I might have. It is easy to contact whether by phone, computer or app. I can always get the answers I need.<br/> <br/>You will be hard pressed to find a better online institute that manages to balance great customer service with free useful features and also helps grow your money at the same time.",2016-06-26

The rates are fantastic for what is a simple savings account, with the APR rate of 1%. I had previously been using a branch savings account that netted me an interest rate below 0.05%. This alone was the reason I switched to Ally Bank. Also, the customer service is fantastic. It was very easy to use their online chat and have all of my questions answered. I have not tried any of the other options, because this online chat service has worked so well. The industry standard applies when it comes to fees and restrictions so there was no drop off in that concern. Overall, I am extremely pleased that I have switched to Ally, and would recommend anyone who is simply opening a savings account to do the same.",2016-06-22
1211,Poor Bill Pay,24205,277,Ally Bank,30992,1,Ally bank for some great unknown reason removed all ref to the payer from for all bills using their bill pay. So your transaction history just shows check paid vs. Baltimore Gas Electric. <br/>Bill pay is supposed to make this easier. Why use it if they are going to make tracking your spending impossible.<br/>Their response to date has been I don't know why we changed but we have no plans to restore the capability. <br/>For anyone that expects to need an accounting (Medicaid) you will have to provide not only the register but copies of all the checks since they don't show where they went and reconcile.

1213,Beware Terrible All Around,24161,277,Ally Bank,30878,1,"Never someone to write a review but I literally search how to write a review so the public can know what they are getting into before going with Ally.<br/><br/>Where do I begin.. <br/><br/>Customer Service, starting with having to wait 15-20 min to speak to a representative. To process payments over the phone they send you to a third party Western Union to pay the bill and a $9 processing fee. Drop calls. <br/><br/>Web experience, No online payment process. they do not make it easy to pay a bill.<br/><br/>Ally seems to be either behind in time or just not with this day in age. Literally update your system. <br/><br/>I would never go with Ally Bank if for any future leases in insure a car. I can not stress that enough.",2016-06-16
1214,Very Pleased With Ally,24134,277,Ally Bank,30812,5,"This is the bank I am using to manage my ailing elderly fathers funds with. The customer service is great here, and they answer questions I thought they couldn't. I'm very happy with my experience, and I was able to manage my father's funds for him very efficiently. I was also able to take money out of a savings account for a hospital bill when I thought it was unavailable. I would have been in a financial struggle without this bank and the help of their awesome customer service team! I couldn't be happier, and would definitely say to anyone looking for an online bank that this one is by far the best choice you could ever make. Their log in process is even easy, and with a secure website I don't have to worry about my account being compromised.",2016-06-13
1215,Bank that really cares about its customers,24097,277,Ally Bank,30729,5,"I have been a customer of Ally Bank for over three years and truly believe that this bank has my best interests at heart. Not only is their website and mobile application very user-friendly, they have the quickest customer service of any industry I have tried to contact before. I also appreciate that Ally will not charge me every individual day that my balance is overdrawn, as this has happened to me unexpectedly on occasion, there is just a one time fee for account over drafting. My checking and savings account are both without a monthly or yearly fee which is also a blessing, as I have had banks in the past charge both of these type of fees. This bank is extremely fair with their fees and I have never had a complaint towards them. I plan to stay at Ally for life!",2016-06-10
1216,Really Confused,24106,277,Ally Bank,14100,5,"Glad to see a more than positive review of Ally. What confuses me is the extent of negative comments yielded against this bank. I've been using them for years....checking account, savings, money market and CDs. I've never had a bad experience. Yet to read some of the remarks made over a large span of time, I'd think that this must be one of the worst banks in existence. Hmmm.",2016-06-10
1217,Best Online Banking Experience with Excellent Customer Service,24091,277,Ally Bank,30723,5,I've been a member of Ally Bank for about 6 months now. I initially signed up a year ago but did not follow through with the first deposit. I went back after my previous bank kept charging overdraft fees when the money was in the bank due to the way they reset the pending balances at night. I am so glad I did. I had a problem at first trying to create a new account online because of the previous account I tried to open. I called customer service and they were so friendly and helpful. They were able to help me out and let me know what additional information I needed to reopen the old account as well as the information I needed to open another joint account with my spouse. Both accounts were ready to use within a few days. Transferring money from my old bank was a breeze! I love Ally and its customer service. They are truly a great online bank!,2016-06-09
1218,The Best of the Online Banks,24039,277,Ally Bank,30580,5,"My interaction with Ally Bank has been outstanding. I have had several accounts with them for several years and have always been extremely happy with their service and products. Recently, I became the trustee for my parents family trust and I found out that they had their money tied up in several local banks. Those banks were paying out a whopping 1/10th of 1 percent per year interest. I asked them if I could move their money to Ally so they could at least get 1% or 10x what they were getting. They agreed. Being that opening a trust account is more complicated than a regular savings account I had to call Ally's customer service department to get the proper paperwork. They sent me the correct forms and even walked me through the process to ensure that I filled everything out correctly and provided them with the proper documentation. The process was flawless and the account was opened and funded within 5 days. I wouldn't bank with anyone else on-line but Ally Bank. THEY HAVE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE.",2016-06-05
1219,"Good customer service, but horrible website",24034,277,Ally Bank,30575,3,"Ally Bank has excellent customer service. When you call to resolve issues or do personal banking, they are very quick to answer and extremely helpful. I've only waited a couple of minutes on hold in the past to get a live person on the line. Only once did the original person not know the answer to my questions and immediately got a supervisor on the line instead of waiting to be called back. This is one of the best aspects of Ally Bank. However, they have an absolutely horrible website. It does not offer anywhere near the information that the other banks currently offer online. They really need to increase the functionality of the website to make it more user-friendly. Their fees and products are fairly competitive with the other banks. They are overall satisfactory, but could definitely use some help on the website!",2016-06-03
1220,Ally is a good bank,24032,277,Ally Bank,30573,4,"I've had both checking and savings accounts at Ally Bank for several years, and am quite happy with them. They are very convenient. They refund fees from any ATM in the USA, which is a huge plus and has saved me lots of money over the years. I've contacted their customer service department several times over the years, by both online chat and telephone, and every time the customer service agents have been helpful and polite. Their website is intuitive and easy to use. I contact them before travelling internationally, and have had no problem accessing funds from foreign ATM's. I'd recommend Ally to anyone looking for a convenient and safe online bank.",2016-06-02
1221,"Ally Bank is Easy to Use, with Good Rates of Return",24028,277,Ally Bank,30569,5,"When I moved to a new city to start a new job, I needed a new banking institution. Having spent a lot of my savings on moving expenses and significantly reducing my student debt, many of the local institutions or larger banks were above the minimum deposit amounts that I could guarantee moving into their accounts without incurring my own fees as well. With the advent of mobile deposit, and not having a lot of need for an in-person banking experience, I began considering the option of a web-only banking institution. I considered Ally bank due to their strong reputation of being able to provide excellent customer service if needed, and otherwise being a very simple institution to use. They have one of the highest interest rates on a savings account that I could find between comparable institutions that were available to me. Most importantly, they did not have any minimum deposits, or any monthly fees to worry about if I was not able to keep a minimum amount in my accounts. I currently use Ally for both their regular interest checking, and their online savings account. I have had no trouble using mobile deposit to deposit checks into my checking account. Their phone app is very simple to use, and I can easily transfer money between accounts within seconds. I highly recommend Ally bank to anyone looking for an alternative to a larger bank, and looking to both avoid monthly fees, and get a good interest rate on your savings account.",2016-06-02
1222,"I Found My ""Ally""",23850,277,Ally Bank,30057,5,"I love Ally Bank. I signed up maybe 3 months ago and it was been a wonderful experience. The application process was super easy and only took minutes. I opened a Money Market account that comes with a checking card. I use it like my checking's account; I receive interest on my money and there is almost no fees. I was tired of getting hit with fees from my regular banks, and Ally has been very good to me and my family. I love on the website and app that it tells you how long the wait time for phone calls to customer service. I also really enjoy the mobile application. It works very well and I have no issues with it at all, I think I use the app for 90% of my banking. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a good bank with less headaches. I have only called customer service once and it was for a very quick question, but that was handled very professional as well. I can't speak about all their products but I am going to look into them shortly to see if I can get everything under one account.",2016-05-17
1223,Banking With Ally,23847,277,Ally Bank,30054,4,"I have been banking with Ally for a little less than a year now, and I only have an online savings account with them. When I started my search for a new place to keep my spare cash, I did a bit of research on the web to try to find the best interest rate. I stumbled upon Ally and they were offering 1% APY. I had heard the name before, and did another quick search to make sure they were trusted. After this I went through the process of setting up an account which was pretty simple and only required a couple of phone calls. Their phone service was phenomenal during these calls. Since then, my deposits have been easy and the interest is good (compared to others). I would definitely recommend Ally Bank!",2016-05-16

After 3 weeks I called Ally to see what was going on. Told me they submitted the paperwork to Schwab on 4/13. Schwab mailed the 50K check on 4/21. I don't see it in my Ally account after a week, so I call Ally. I'm told it takes 7-10 days to 'process' the check. I asked will I get interest on it while it's being processed? Response again was it takes 7-10 business days to process the check. I have more than enough in the account to cover the check, so why does it take 7-10 business days to 'process' a check without adding the balance to my account? Not happy with their speed of service while they sit on my money.",2016-05-01
1225,An Excellent Bank,23759,277,Ally Bank,29802,5,"I moved my savings account to Ally more than two years ago and I've been pleasantly surprised. Most banks pay a tiny fraction of a percent on savings accounts but Ally pays a full percent or more. The website and free app are easy to use and I've had zero problems using the app to deposit checks. Money orders have to be mailed to Ally to be deposited but Ally supplies a stack of pre-paid envelopes on request. The few times that I've had to consult Ally's customer service have been extremely positive experiences, especially compared to the horrible experiences I've had with my previous online bank. I was so satisfied with Ally that I've set up a direct deposit and moved all my kids' savings account to Ally too. Ally also allows up to six free transfers out of the account per month. As you can tell, I'm a satisfied customer.",2016-04-28
1226,No Longer Revolutionary,23772,277,Ally Bank,29843,1,"When they first came on the scene, they were great. Low fees, good service, no issues. Fast forward 3 years later. Their fees are online with the rest of the industry, they cut perks, and their service is terrible....I had to speak to 4 people to get an issue resolved that was their fault. I'm closing my account and going back to my old bank, Their product is no longer revolutionary, they're just like every other bank now",2016-04-27
1227,Ally Bank,23756,277,Ally Bank,29799,5,"I switched over to Ally bank around 6 months ago and could not be happier with the accounts and customer service. It took around 20 minutes to open a interest checking and interest savings account and around 4 days for my debit card to arrive. The interest checking is exceptional in that it does not charge any fees and I actually get .1% back a year. To compare that to my previous bank, I was making .01% with my savings and am now receiving ten times the interest in my checking account. The debit card is a master card and has wide usability making this account amazing to say the least. The savings account was the main reason I switched over. As I said previously, my old bank was giving me .01% for savings. I receive 1% in interest a year from Ally. This rate ranks among the highest of all the banks. Overall I would highly recommend Ally Bank due to the rates and amazing customer service.",2016-04-27
1228,I Have Found The Online Bank Of My Dreams !!!,23715,277,Ally Bank,29678,5,"I have had an Ally Banking account for a little over a year now, and Ally is every bit as good if not better than a physical bank. I have a checking account and a savings account. The checking account pays an interest rate of 0.10% and the savings account pays an interest rate at 1.00%. Since they don't have physical locations and actual ATM's they will reimburse you up to $10 at the end of each month for ATM fee's. Plus the Allpoint ATMs have a deal setup with Ally where if Ally customers use their ATM's there is automatically no charge at all. I have my paycheck deposited every Friday morning , and I have never had a problem at all. Before I decided to switch to Ally I was a little skeptical since they didn't have any locations, but that has never been a problem, they strive for convenience and convenience is what I have found the whole time I have dealt with Ally. I have free checking, so in other words, I haven't paid ally any money at all for using their bank. It's the first bank I've ever dealt with where I've never paid them any money!!! I would fully recommend anyone to switch and go with ally !!!",2016-04-22
1229,Horrible For Iras,23637,277,Ally Bank,29482,3,"Ally is okay for general banking and savings, but they’re horrible for IRAs. They call themselves an online bank, but for depositing funds into IRAs they strictly do snail mail, and their customer service reps love to play the “blame the post office” for their slowness. Forget about those last minute deposits in April for the previous tax year. I got burned on that once before, and this year gave it two weeks, but so far, after 8 days they are still claiming they’ve received nothing.<br/><br/>Even if you just want to transfer funds from another Ally account to your IRA, the “online” form is very deceiving. You fill in the pertinent information and then all it does is generate a PDF file for you to print and (snail) mail!<br/><br/>There are plenty of other institutions where you can add to your IRA via a smartphone app. I’ll be moving my IRA before the end of the year.",2016-04-12
1230,Don't Bank With Ally,23633,277,Ally Bank,29473,1,I deposited mt echeck with Ally because they claim that the first $200 is available next business day. They held my check deposit for 5 business days saying that it was because i had frequent overdrafts. I've had 3 overdrafts that I paid back. No traditional bank holds money that long. I have an account with Wells Fargo and they've never held my check for an extended time. I will deposit at WF from now on. Ally just lost my business.,2016-04-12

I have a checking and savings account through them, and have had enjoyed my time spent with them. Their mobile and web interfaces are very user friendly, and I love how easy it is to find what you are looking for. They provide the best return on a savings account that I have found so far, and definitely far better than my old bank. The only area in which I wouldn't give them a 5 star rating is in their customer service. I do feel like this could be improved upon. Although it is better than most banks that I have had trouble with, there is still a significant amount of time spent on hold waiting to talk to someone. Compared to previous experiences, I do enjoy their customer service, and feel as though I am always greeted by friendly agents who want to help me with my problems. Overall I believe that Ally provides good services, and at the root of their business, cares about their customers. If they continue to put us first, I will continue to use them for my banking needs.",2016-04-06

1234,No Complaints,23494,277,Ally Bank,29054,5,"Ally Bank is a really great online bank to use. I was first drawn to it for it's high savings rate. It is much higher than any physical bank near me. What is good about them is that their savings rate changes as the market changes. Sometimes it may go down, but it can go up when the market is better. In this way, it it much more flexible than a typical bank. There aren't any fees so there isn't a drawback to having an account to test it out for a while. It took a while for me to get an account because you have to apply for one so don't expect an account right away. My only issue is that depositing cash is a little tricky only because there isn't a physical location that you can go to.",2016-03-25
1235,Disappointing & Upsetting CD Purchase,23503,277,Ally Bank,29092,2,"I sent a large check to Ally to open a CD. A week later I received a call stating my letter had been received but there was no check with it. We reported a possible theft to the USPS, and contacted the issuing bank who informed us the check had been cashed. I received one follow up call from Ally, and were told the check was still missing. I informed the rep if/when the check was found I no longer wanted the CD I wanted my money back. Two days later I learned the check had been cashed by Ally, but no-one from the bank bothered to inform me. AND they had gone ahead and applied the check toward the CD. My wife and I were literally sick of what appeared to be a big loss to us. I know Ally has good rates. Otherwise I would have given them one star. But after our two CD's mature, we won't be dealing with them again.",2016-03-24
1236,A Better Savings Account,23483,277,Ally Bank,29043,4,"I've had a savings account at another bank for years, but was getting .05% or less back per year. I talked to Ally and they made it a very easy decision to switch my account over. I started at 1% APY, more than 20 times what I was receiving at my previous bank. But the part that really sold me was the fees on the account. My previous account had fees everywhere, from monthly maintenance fees to fees for even checking my balance at a different bank's ATM, and the money I was making on the account wasn't nearly enough to cover it. My new Ally account doesn't have monthly fees, and makes it easy for me to access my money, even from other banks' ATMs. On top of all this, Ally's customer service was a wonderful experience for me, especially since there is no way to walk in and talk with a banker. Their call center was by far the fastest service I've gotten for customer support, and is open 24/7. I set up my account after getting home from work, something other banks make it difficult for me to do.",2016-03-22
1237,Awesome Alternative To Local Bank,23409,277,Ally Bank,28839,4,"We have been using Ally for a little over a year. Their products and interest rates were much better than we could find locally, and their website is very user friendly. We have both a savings and checking account with them and have been very satisfied. The online deposit feature is very convenient, and the fact that they refund all your ATM fees monthly makes it very easy to access your funds wherever and whenever you need them, without worrying about it costing you more. The one issue we had with someone illegally using our account was handled swiftly and professionally and their fraud and customer service departments kept us in the loop at all times. No one likes to battle identity fraud, but thankfully they made the process relatively painless.",2016-03-15

So I followed there instructions for taking a picture and depositing it. Later that day they rejected it bc it included my husband 's name, even though he signed it. So my only option they claimed was to mail this now signed 20k check to them. After doing that I receive a email stating it was deposited. I go to look in my account but I'm locked out. I call only to find out on a Friday evening sorry we can't tell you anything about your account, only another department can and they are only in M-F 8-5. They wouldn't tell me where my money was, why it was locked...nothing. This is not a bank I would trust with your funds. I will be moving money as soon as they find it.

In complete user error, I hit the wrong fast cash button at an ATM and withdrew too much money. Seems simply enough just to put it back, but as with most internet banks they do not allow cash deposits. I called the bank in near terror because I had scheduled a payment to come through the following day. The representative was very sympathetic as she went over all of my possible options for putting money into the account right away. I ended up transferring money from a debit card with an outside bank that I had already preregister with the Ally for transfers. The representative was able to make the transfer right over the phone for me. Things worked out great, and I love my helpful online bank.",2016-02-12

I was skeptical about doing business with a bank that was purely online, but once I read some reviews, I decided to dive in and give it a shot. I was really impressed to find out how accommodating Ally was with their App experience for my iPhone as well as the competitive rate for their accounts. The interest that is accrued is compounded daily which is another great perk. I also love the fact that I was immediately sent a debit card and checks, free of charge, upon Ally receiving my first deposit. Both the website and the app are very easy to use; allowing me to deposit checks on the go and being able to withdraw money from ATM's with all of the charges being reimbursed promptly after.",2016-02-06

I sell lots of things online and wanted a separate and easy account to deposit my earnings. ALLY was the only place which had a true no-fee checking. They sent checks, debit cards and all the things you would expect. I was very impressed since they also beat the rates at our local credit union. To withdraw money you agree to the fees at a machine and they reimburse you at the end of the month. They truly have no fees. Very impressive bank which I would highly recommend to anyone.",2016-02-05
1244,Decent bank (best out there) to stash away some cash for more interest rate...,23156,277,Ally Bank,28088,5,"I've been using Ally Bank for about three years now and I've switched from another online bank primarily attracted by a little higher rate on their CDs. After initial couple years i have stayed on because their CD rates were either better than most or equal to competitors. On top they offered me a retention bonus of small percentage increase on my rate. So overall my experience has been fine. <br/> <br/>My only issue with this banks comes in the form on lack of brick and mortar branches AND more importantly limited international reach of the bank. The first I can live without, that's why I have my checking account in another bank (and use Ally mostly as a savings account). But the international aspect is sort of hampering. For example, I recently wanted to transfer funds IN and OUT of international account. Ally Bank turns out does not have it's own Swift code and works via Deutsche Bank or someone else in NYC. IT was nearly impossible to explain to international partners how to transfer funds to me or how to get paid by me using Ally. At the end I gave up and opted to use my regular bank (which also charged more fees, sadly) for international transactions.",2016-02-05
1245,My Go To Bank,23133,277,Ally Bank,1613,5,"I've been banking with Ally for over 5 years now and it has become my go-to bank, the hub from which I do all my banking. It has a very nice online interface, great phone support with nice representatives and they live up to their no-hidden-fees slogan. They also have high limits for ACH transfers making them an easy choice for a hub-bank.<br/><br/>I normally hunt for best interest rates and as a result have banked with many banks. Ally is my bank of choice even when their rates a little lower than competition. <br/><br/>They have accommodated my (sometimes unusual) requests in very nice, attentive, and prompt manner, even when they did not have to!<br/><br/>My only complaint: their paper statements are too verbose and consume way more paper than they need to!",2016-02-02
1246,Great for Savings,23095,277,Ally Bank,27873,5,We were sick and tired of paying fees with our local bank just to maintain our measly savings. It totally goes against the whole idea of SAVINGS when you have to pay maintenance fees on your account and not to mention the interest we were receiving was nominal. So we decided to check out some of the online banks. We went to ClarkHoward.com and some of the other money adviser sites. It seemed there was a general consensus that Ally Bank was the best in most areas of online banking. So we decided to do a thorough exam of the Ally Bank website. We were very impressed and I loved that there were no maintenance fees on the savings. So that very same day we decide to open an account with Ally Bank and have been happy with it ever since.,2016-01-29
1247,Great Online Savings Account!,23033,277,Ally Bank,27668,5,"I've had an Ally Savings Account for a little while now, and it has been a pleasant experience. I use them because my previous savings account was barely paying any interest, and I wanted the competitive interest rate that Ally offers. For money just sitting around in my savings this seemed like a no-brainer! The one downside I have found is it can take a couple of business days for the transfers to go through. This isn't a big deal for me because I have plenty of money in my checking account but if you would need to transfer a lot keep that in mind. Their customer support has been excellent the couple of times I needed to use them. I changed addresses shortly after setting up my account so my account was frozen since it could have been a potential fraud issue. They contacted me and we were able to get everything going again very quickly. The wait times on their phone support are always very short too (Less than a one minute wait)! I would definitely recommend them!",2016-01-19

As far as I know, they are completely online, and that is why they are able to offer such great rates on savings and CDs. Starting the account was flawless. I just added some details and connected the account to one of my existing accounts. The money transferred right over. Since opening the account, I have opened a few CDs, and I'm thinking about an IRA. They have an app where you can send in checks by taking a picture and its really easy.

However, sometimes the code doesn't show up and there's no other way to get it. You have to call Ally, and then they act like they've never encountered this problem before.",2016-01-05
1251,Ally Bank Review,22933,277,Ally Bank,27323,5,"I have been using Ally bank for around two years and have been very impressed with the bank and the online interface. Currently, I have multiple savings accounts as well as a checking account with Ally and use it a few times a month to make deposits, withdraws and transfers. The highlight of Ally, which originally attracted me to them, was the relatively high interest rates they provide for savings accounts. They are significantly better than anything I could find locally at a brick and mortar bank and in-line with other established online banks as far as I can tell. What I have been surprised with is the ease of use of the online interface and how simple it is to transfer money between accounts or to another banking institution. I have also been interested in their CDs as their rates are competitive with the market, but I have yet to put money into them. Overall, I have been very happy with Ally and will continue to use them going forward.",2016-01-04
1252,Brick-and-mortar banks cannot compete against Ally in terms of features and fees.,22928,277,Ally Bank,27318,4,"My past banking experiences with standard brick-and-mortar banks have been, for lack of better words, quite terrible. The main problem I have run up against is the myriad fees: monthly account fees, withdrawal fees, transfer fees, check fees, and the big one:ATM fees. Before switching to Ally, I was spending approximately $40 per month on various banking fees. After switching to Ally, I spend nothing on fees, in fact Ally actually credits your account at the end of the month if you did get changed with any ATM fees from out of network ATM charges. This is a much nicer than a $2.50 penalty for not using my previous bank's ATM. I feel much freer to get money out when I need it rather than taking out large quantities just to avoid fees. The customer service at Ally has been great and they accepted all of my details and documents over the phone and Internet, I did not have to send them anything in the mail. This made it really easy to sign up for and when ever I have to call the wait time in the queue is always short. The Ally Mobile Banking app is also handy as it tells you the current queue time, which is usually zero or one minute long. The app is easy to use and never crashes either. Highly recommended bank!",2016-01-01
1253,CDs from Ally Bank,22927,277,Ally Bank,27317,4,"I have been banking with Ally Bank for at least 7 years purchasing CDs as a safe hedge for my savings. So far, their rates have been competitive so I have been rolling over my CDs when they mature. They are good at keeping me informed about the balance in my account with quarterly statements and always contact me about 6-8 weeks prior to when my CDs will mature. After the first time they matured, they offered to add to the current CD rate by .25% to entice me to continue my business with them. That .25% is a good incentive to stay with them. All in all, I am quite satisfied with their CD service. My CDs will mature in May and June of 2016. If they continue with their excellent rates and good customer service, I will continue to roll over my CDs.",2016-01-01
1254,4 years with this bank and no issues,22924,277,Ally Bank,27314,4,"I have been banking with Ally Bank since 2011. They are a simple and easy to work with company. I enjoy this bank because of the lack of fees, minimum deposit amounts, and reliable customer service. A great perk of choosing Ally is that you can use any ATM, and whatever fees there may be, Ally will reimburse it to your account each month. I find this perk very helpful, as many ATM's will charge up to $5 sometimes. Definitely saves you money. The interactions and experiences I've had with the customer service have all been great, and my issues or concerns were always addressed quickly.<br/> <br/>I also like this bank's easy-to-use website and phone app. If you have a check, you can just use your phone to take photos of the check, and deposit it to your account through that. No need to drive anywhere, just do it at home, work , or wherever.<br/> <br/>Being an online bank, the one big downside is that you cannot deposit cash, since they do not have official institutions or ATM's anywhere like other banks. It would certainly be nice to be able to do this, but I have found ways to work with it and it's never been a large enough issue for me to switch banks.<br/> <br/>Overall, my experience with Ally bank has been largely positive, and there's never been a need to switch to another bank.",2015-12-30
1255,Started Off Great...Has Fallen Off A Cliff.,22919,277,Ally Bank,27302,1,"We started using Ally in 2013 and had great experiences up until the last month or so. <br/><br/>They have refused to embrace technology. No chips on their debit cards and no mobile pay options. Due to this, we thought they would be helpful and understanding when our account information was stolen. We had 2 fraudulent charges show up on our account, so we immediately checked to see if we had both cards (we did) and called Ally to report it within hours of the charge posting on our account.<br/><br/>They said they would look into and send us some paperwork via e-mail, which they did. We promptly sent it back and then received a verification of receipt. Great we thought...but no. We get a call the next day asking if we plan to complete the paperwork and submit. We told them we had already done so, so they looked into it and found it. OK. Annoying, but it happens. We were told to expect a response in 30 days. No provisional credit or anything. We were just out $600 until the reviewed it. Seemed like pretty crappy customer service to us.<br/><br/>I call a week later to check in on the status of the claim and find out that their is no claim associated with our account. They had lost the paperwork. So after 2 hours on the phone between me and my wife with Ally, they get the process started again. We are initially told it would be resolved in 3-5 days and then told it could be up to 60 days. <br/><br/>In an effort to clarify this discrepancy, we end up on the phone with a manager who asks repeatedly if we had checked the balance on our account recently (we had done so at the start of the call), but I logged back in to find provisional credits on our account. We appreciated this (it should have been done the instant the fraud happened), but did not appreciate being told about like it had been their all along and we were idiots for calling in.<br/><br/>Now add on the fact that we are trying to close on a home in the near future and I just went to pull out our money in a cashier's check for the down payment which we had been told could be mailed overnight and found that it would take 5-7 days. Despite being told that getting our money quickly would not be an issue in cases like this, Ally did nothing to repair the situation. <br/><br/>At this point in time, we no longer feel like our money is safe OR valued at Ally. We have told them this several times and they have not batted an eye. If not for the house closing process, we would have already left. I want to recommend them based on our years of positive experience, but now that we actually need our bank to work for us and give us access to our money, they have not been respectful or accommodating.",2015-12-30
1256,Closed Account Because They Refused Joint Account,22918,277,Ally Bank,27299,1,"The site does look good, and works well usually (not always, especially on the iPhone). But for me the killer was when they refused to add my wife as a joint owner on their accounts. They refused to discuss why or take any input. It was also infuriating during my many attempts to communicate with them that sometimes you land on someone incapable of carrying on an intelligent conversation, who just repeats phrases that they seem to have been taught. In all fairness, some of the telephone help was good. But I had said from the outset that the account was to be joint, and they had said to sign up myself first, and then do the additional paperwork, which I did. They did not come through. Good riddance.",2015-12-30
1257,No Problem So Far,22915,277,Ally Bank,27276,5,"My experience with Ally has been very good so far, however, I realize that is maybe because I don't have too many needs. I barely ever use paper checks, I only have a few credit card payments each month, and I almost never use the ATM since I opened my account with them a few years ago.<br/>I opened Ally checking and savings accounts because Wells Fargo was about to charge me an ungodly amount of ""maintenance fees"".<br/>Opening the accounts were very easy and all my questions were quickly answered via chat. I love that I never had to wait more than a couple minutes for a customer service.<br/>I've had the same problem as some reviewers here, of Ally putting an extended hold on my deposits due to overdraft. That was my fault as I had miscalculated the total amount of bills I had to pay that month and didn't transfer enough from my savings account. <br/>So far, I have absolutely no complaint against Ally. We'll see if and when I have to start using direct deposit, or ACH, or wire transfer if I run into any problems.",2015-12-29
1258,"Very good overall Bank, Website Limited",22906,277,Ally Bank,27262,4,"I signed up for Ally Bank several months ago. They have been a generally good bank to deal with. Although their website is too simplistic and not very user friendly or easy to navigate, the bank itself is a good choice, especially for people looking for a second chance or poor credit checking account to use for online banking. The fees were very low and very reasonable. The debit card and checks came very quickly and the initial setup was very easy and was a very smooth process. In addition, they were able to identify and stop a fraudulent attempt to steal and use my checking account information, which saved me a ton of time and effort. Even though the website was not very well designed or user-friendly, the customer service by phone was very good and the associates were extremely friendly and helpful.",2015-12-28
1259,Closed Account 1 Month After Opening,22867,277,Ally Bank,27150,1,"As others have mentioned the big downside of an ""internet only"" bank is they automate a lot of their processes, leaving you victim to their computer ""logic.""<br/><br/>My wife and I opened a new checking and savings account with Ally. About a month after opening it, they said they were closing our checking account because ""per our conversation, we do not allow business activity on our accounts.""<br/><br/>1) What conversation? No one called me.<br/><br/>2) The ""business activity"" turned out to me some extra books we sold on Amazon and two $6 craft ornaments my wife sold on Etsy (a holiday time hobby, not a business). Neither of these are businesses, but the call service rep just said she had no control over it and the account was automatically triggered to close.<br/><br/>Zero customer service, and a huge headache for no reason. Beware if you ever plan to have an electronic deposit to this account that isn't a paycheck, because they will close it on you with barely a heads up.<br/><br/>The credit union we transferred from had a 2.00% APY (twice what Ally gives) so do yourself a favor and join a credit union. Banks are just awful. We are going back to that credit union since we found out they have shared branches across the nation.",2015-12-21
1260,CD Early Withdrawal Easy,22866,277,Ally Bank,27149,5,The registration of a 5 yr CD was easy and the redemption prior to the 5 yrs was simple and very quick. Will do business with Ally again when their rates become more competitive as they were in the past.,2015-12-21
1261,Ally Bank is a great bank,22837,277,Ally Bank,27055,5,"I have been with Ally Bank for over 4 years now and love how easy it is to get things accomplished. Need to order checks? No problem those are free forever. ALL ATM fees are reimbursed on your closing date, website experience is responsive and easy without needing to use a dedicated phone or tablet app. Like banking apps? Ally has one as well and works well from my experiences on Android, Windows Phone, or iOS. Overdraft fees are relatively lower compared to the competition. Lost your debit card? I have twice and they replaced it for free. There is a $15 charge for expedited replacement and shipping via FedEx. They have reps 24/7 and never have to go through a difficult phone system just to reach a live person.<br/> <br/>They also went to bat for me when I had a creditor who was claiming payments were not being made via eChecks and put stop order on the automatic debit and reimbursed me for subsequent charges that the creditor has made.<br/> <br/>Assuming you can pass a credit check, Ally Bank is a great bank to be with and will take care of your every need as if they were right down the street. Highly recommended.",2015-12-17
1262,Great Alternative To Traditional Banking,22805,277,Ally Bank,26962,5,"I have had an account with Ally Bank for about six years and in that time I have been quite pleased with them. Their customer service is excellent and have always been able to answer my questions and concerns. I once forgot my password and ended up having to call them for assistance. The customer rep I spoke with was very understanding and good natured, even after I said I realized what my correct password was. I also very much approve of their process wherein you can photograph a check and upload the images for deposit, rather than wait for it to arrive by mail. It's very helpful if you need something deposited quickly. My only minor complaint with Ally is that their mobile app is somewhat unstable and doesn't include all of the features that the website does. Other than that I think they've been great, and I really enjoy having a checking account that doesn't have a ""maintenance fee"" attached to it.",2015-12-13

1264,Ally Online Savings Account,22728,277,Ally Bank,26778,5,"Ally Bank Online Savings Account is definitely one of the best saving account in the country with a extremely high savings rate of 1.00% beating almost all of the banks in the country<br/> <br/>Before using Ally Savings account, I had several savings account with other big banks. But the interest I earned was so pathetically low so I knew I had to switch to other account. A quick google for the best savings account and ally bank named popped out. The best thing about ally was that it had a great savings rate but on top of that no fees or no minimum deposit. This was crucial for me as I wanted to test it out first with small amount. I have to say I have probably earned more money from ally in one month than with my original bank in a year. The process of opening account was very quick. The only downside is that there is no way to deposit cash so you do need to transfer from another bank which is 2 - 3 day process. The website is very intuitive and simple.

I have been with them for 2 years now and I have saved a lot of money just between the fees from the other bank and the high APY. I've only had a problem once with a direct deposit. I called the toll free number, talked to a CS rep, and it was fixed right up the next morning. They also have an app which my old bank did not. it's so convenient and easy to bank now. I can deposit checks and transfer money all quickly and easily through the app. Ally is definitely worth five stars!",2015-11-27

We opened a dual-named account so that I could both monitor his spending, and so that I could get cash to him in a hurry if he needed it. Ally Bank has met all of his and my banking needs, and he has not even overdrawn his first ATM account! This is the first online account I have used, and it also allows me to scan in checks from home. This account is perfect for our needs.",2015-11-19
1268,The Best Bank for New Yorkers,22555,277,Ally Bank,26232,5,"Although Ally does not have any physical branches, I found them to be the best bank for me. I was first intrigued because they reimburse you all of your ATM fees. As a New York-er who is constantly on the go, this stuck out to me the most. Many businesses in NYC are cash only, and where I currently reside, Brooklyn, does not have many Bank of America branches. I was constantly paying ATM fees so I could get cash to go to my favorite establishments. But with Ally I did not have to stress about high ATM fees because I would be getting reimbursed anyways! Another plus is that all three accounts I have with them have interest rates that kill the competition's. I am earning interest in my savings, checking, and money market account. I have had to call Ally bank on two separate occasions. Once my checks were lost in the mail, and another time I was requesting a debit card. Each time I called I was only on hold for a moment and I spoke to reps who spoke perfect English and were overall very friendly! The connection was also clear. I did not feel uncomfortable during my calls and I hung up feeling 100% satisfied. I use the Ally banking app to transfer money between my Ally accounts and also to/from my Bank of America account and I have never had any issues with the app. I think Ally is a great bank and I have absolutely no complaints. I will be a lifelong customer.",2015-10-29

Honest mistake on their part, and I had dome my due diligence in changing the banking information in a timely manner. So when Ally got the request for payment, the refused payment. They did charge me $25 as a NSF fee. I am no dead-beat and have never had an NSF with Ally before. Thought I could call them up, explain the circumstances, and they would do the right thing and let me off the hook. Apparently they wanted the $25 more than my business because they refused the request. I closed the account during that call.",2015-10-27
1270,Ally Not The Bank It Use To Be,22488,277,Ally Bank,26077,1,"Ally use to be good. But sadly this is no longer the case. They have raised fees. Put $10 cap on ATM fee reimbursement. They also are scandalous in there system. Debits are applied before credits which means if you have low balance and have a bill on auto pay and you put money in your account the same day, the bill is paid first and you are charged an overdraft fee which is now $25 a hit. Also if you have a Savings account with Overdraft protection with enough money to cover the overdraft but less than $100 they will not transfer money and overdraft your account. You get 1 overdraft fee reimbursement for the Lifetime of the account. Not monthly or annually LIFETIME OF THE ACCOUNT. worst of all is there TERRIBLE Customer service which btw is only 24/7 phone or email now. All the things that made Ally great are now gone.

I chose Ally because they were well known and I was assured the process was painless. I was blown away at how quickly it took to open my new account. It was instantaneous compared to my other bank. There was no minimum balance to open, i wasn't being charged a monthly maintenance fee, and the APY was pretty good. One issue I feel I might run into though is not finding an ATM that I can withdraw money from, though it's not that big of a setback since I usually pay with a debit card anyway. I've only had my Ally banking account for about two months now, but I'm actually thinking of ditching my brick and mortar bank entirely now.",2015-10-08
1273,Overall a great experience,22408,277,Ally Bank,25866,4,"I've had an Ally account for many years and one of the things that has continuously impressed me is the fact that they have always continued to innovate and improve. They seem to really invest in the customer experience and it shows. While it is sometimes frustrating not to have a brick and mortar location to go to, the on the go tools that they offer mostly make up for it. For example, you can deposit your checks online without any fuss. Also, they have always been easy to contact for customer service issues and have generally speaking been quick to resolve problems. It's great having so much flexibility and their website and user interface make it really easy to keep track of my money. I would recommend ally to anyone who is interested in an internet bank. They're a reputable company and I've never had any problems worth noting.",2015-10-07

Additionally, there is no cost for a checking account and multiple savings accounts so I can use separate accounts for different saving goals without a problem which helps me organize. The customer service has always been excellent and anytime I had an issue it was resolved very quickly via their live chat support. The mobile app is awesome - I deposit checks remotely with it every month and never had any problems with it working. The only thing I wish they did differently was give us a debit card with that new security chip in it.",2015-10-06
1275,A Great Bank with Less Than Perfect Online Interface,22385,277,Ally Bank,25792,4,"I recently moved most of my money in savings accounts into the online savings at Ally, due to the superior interest rates; given that the interest rates at Ally are almost 100-fold better than those at brick and mortar institutions and Ally is FDIC Insured, I would recommend this to anyone who is aiming to save for something in the short term.<br/> <br/>The online banking and apps that Ally has are the downfall though - they simply don't have the same amount of features as other more standard banks. For example, if you make a large deposit from another account at another bank, the app tells you that because of the size of the deposit, it won't all be available in the account right away - which is fine, except for the fact that the transaction disappears completely, from both the online banking login and from the app. The money ended up in the account correctly, but it was a bit worrisome at that time. I also had some difficulty getting transfers without using checks from other banks to work, they always end up getting rejected.<br/> <br/>Other than this, Ally's interest rates make it a solid choice.",2015-10-03

1281,Online banking review,22262,277,Ally Bank,25417,4,"I have been with Ally Bank for 4 years now. I switched to it from Discover Bank primarily due to Ally Bank's more competitive interest rates. However, since moving there they took a hit. Still though the bank has one of the more competitive rates on savings account. I like the fact that transferring money to and from the bank is hassle free and free of charge. What I dislike a bit is that they limit the amount of outbound transaction to just six and that it is nearly impossible (or at least I haven't been able to figure it out) to wire money to and from international accounts. Ally Bank only works fine within the United States. And that can be a major drawback for those who would like to transfer money internationally.",2015-09-11
1282,The benefits outweigh the negatives,22243,277,Ally Bank,25370,4,"To begin with, I'll say that the reason I chose Ally Bank was because my former bank was starting to charge me a 7 or 8 dollar monthly fee because I had a balance less than 1000 dollars. Ally has no minimum balance. Once you set up your account with Ally they send you a debit card by mail and some checks. One thing I really like about Ally is that when you login they provide you with easy access to your account and debit card number. With previous institutions I had to dig through their site for even my account number and then I'd have to look on google for their routing number. The worst thing about Ally has to be depositing cash. You can't do it easily. You would have to do a money order and send it to them, give cash to a friend and have them write you a check, or some other complicated and perhaps expensive method. If you had a physical bank account of course it would not be much problem but considering the fact that I got this online account because I wanted to get rid of maintenance fees, then that was not a viable option. Overall, I'd say I'm pretty satisfied with their service.",2015-09-09
1283,High praise for Ally Bank,22156,277,Ally Bank,25008,5,"The thing that drew me to Ally Bank was their competitive interest rates on both their savings and checking account. Since they have no physical locations they are able to offer interest rates that are higher than any other bank that I researched. In some cases their savings interest rate was double what their competitors are offering. I also like the fact that since they are designed to serve completely online, they offer customer service 24/7. The customer service number is permanently displayed next to the Ally logo on the banner on every webpage. As an extra bonus it shows the estimated wait time. I have been a customer for over a year and I have never seen the wait time over 5 minutes. Whenever I have called the stated time has been accurate. Each time the representative has been friendly and helpful. Ally also just redesigned their account displays. It looks very modern and is easy to navigate. The feature that I like the most appears right after you sign in to your account. The total amount in your accounts is displayed in a colorized pie chart, with the different colors indicating what portion of your money is in which account. I would highly recommend Ally Bank to everyone.",2015-08-31
1284,"Great Idea, but Not Confident",22148,277,Ally Bank,25000,4,"Ally bank has better interest rates then your conventional mortar and brick banks. The website is easy to use and your ATM/Debit card and checks work the same way. I did deposits by mail which did create a delay. You can scan and send a picture through the APP but I have not done this. It is hard to build confidence when you don't actually see a building. I still have not moved a large amount of assets to Ally because if something happens, I have no place to go and actually see a human about it. I feel like someday the bank could go under and all I can do is make a phone call and no one will answer. Overall the bank interest rates are just a little higher so it is worth putting some savings or rainy day money in the bank for it to sit and grow. I would not use this bank for everyday banking. It just doesn't work me and my confidence.",2015-08-27

The lady on the phone was profiling us from the get-go. Then there was a hold up. They called leaving messages to call them back. Every time we called back we were placed on hold for 10+ minutes. Only to find out they needed one of our phone numbers confirmed. After this they told us, ""everything looks good."" Only to receive another phone call that our Driver's license scan image is poor and they can't read it. What? At this point we went to Barclays website and applied for a savings account. The whole process was completed in less than 10 minutes, and our money transferred to them the next day!

1287,A very good option for guaranteed college savings,21959,277,Ally Bank,24660,5,"For an older twenty-something looking to return to college in the near future, the traditional student savings and investment options can seem a bit out-of-touch. Tax-deferred 529 plans are great for long-term investment, but what if you're going back to school in 3-5 years and need to know that you'll be getting more out of your account than what went in? Investing in the stock market can be risky in the short term. I looked at guaranteed-return options, and found that Ally's 0.99% online savings was the best way to go, from not only a rates point of view but also having some of the best customer service around. I've yet to have a problem that required an advanced resolution, but they've been responsive for my needs so far.",2015-07-31

Was drawn to the better interest rates but trying to open an account was not worth the few potential additional dollars earned. First - each time I called the reps took about 10 minutes to find my pending account. Next, not sure if this is industry standard but we had to do a global lift on our credit freeze. Then, despite multiple calls reminding the bank to do the credit check during the 10 day lift, no credit check was done! At one point I was told by a rep that I would get information about my account via mail, but of course nothing ever arrived. 5 out of the 6 reps I spoke with were incompetent and gave me erroneous information.

I don't bounce checks or overdraft so I can't speak to the fees but then again, since I manage my money, I don't really care about the fees. The only fee I could possible experience is ATM fees. Ally provides reimbursement on two withdrawal per months, which is fine with me. The interface is clean and easy to use. It was reworked about three months ago. The look changed but the functionality didn't. There was a little bit of searching within the new interface, but I figured everything out within a short time.

Ally just makes my life easier. While their rates may not be the absolute highest, they don't have bizarre rules about accessing your money, don't nickel-and-dime you with fees, have solid web site/mobile apps and have 24/7 support with almost no wait time. With Ally, you feel like you are dealing with a large, experienced, competent bank. Other internet banks often seem like they are figuring out the business as they go along.<br/><br/>A couple other good things that are different from the other online banks I've tried:<br/>1) When you use billpay, Ally deducts the money from your account when the check clears. Others deduct it when the check is sent.<br/>2) ACH transfers are fast, and you have until 7:30 EST to request it. Other banks have deadlines earlier in the day.",2015-06-11

Especially those times when we need the bank's assistance, and can't seem to get it. Customer service is mediocre at best, almost like talking to an automated message. Their reps seem to have a script, and refuse to stray from it saying the same things over and over as if they haven't heard your response. <br/>Some of our issues include a minimum 3 day hold on non-direct deposits (checks and/or transfers); Cashier's checks take 7-10 business days to receive; the sheer amount of information needed to verify your account and if your not the ""Primary"" - forget about getting anything done. We have a joint checking account but EVERYTIME I call I am told they need to speak to my husband, as he is the ""Primary"" on the account.

Their website includes a wait time estimator so that you can see how long you will wait if you were to place a call at that moment. They also have extended hours until around 11:00 PM on weekdays, as well as weekend hours. Their savings accounts are cool because they have no minimum, which is good for me because sometimes we withdraw our money for vacations, etc and we know our account will not be negatively impacted.

I have a BoA checking account and link my Ally online account to it so I can easily transfer money between them. Ally also has a checking account option but I haven't needed to use it yet. <br/> <br/>The CD's are nice. The rates are very competitive. There are many no fee options which I love. I don't think I've ever paid a single 'fee' for anything since i joined ally. When a CD hits maturity, it's auto moved into another CD with an improved rate. Also, online chat support is great and always available for me. <br/> <br/>the only issue i can see is its not easy to make deposits since they dont have physical locations. you just have to mail it in so it takes a few days but works great. overall i strongly recommend ally!",2015-06-03

Everything you do is online and if you need to call customer service, they tell you what the wait time is on the website. I've only had one issue with Ally Bank so far, and that was over a check I had deposited. To make a deposit, you scan the front and back of your check and upload it. Once it's reviewed and accepted, the funds are deposited into your account - usually the next business day. I get a weekly bonus check each week from my employer, so I deposit it in my Ally account online. After two months of this, I was told by Ally that my check was not accepted. So I gave the customer service number a call. The wait time listed on the website accurate, and I got a friendly fellow on the phone that asked me a few security questions. After I told him my problem, he told me that the check I received only had my first initial on it, and not my full first name. I told him the eight checks I had deposited before that were the same way, and they were accepted, so why was this one declined? He didn't have an answer for me, only saying, ""I'm just telling you what it says here."" So obviously he was of no help to me, and I felt no reason to continue asking him questions he had no answer to.

I had forgotten my password and couldn't log on so I had to call in. I don't think I even spent any time on hold. I was in touch with a representative immediately and he was able to resolve my issue within 5 minutes. The only incident where I had a single problem was when I was in rural Peru and had to report a lost/stolen debit card. I was working with 1 bar of shoddy WiFi to use Skype to call in to report it and check if any charges were made. It took about 20 tries until I was finally able to get it resolved and have a new card sent home. I tried to explain to each one of the operators that I was in a situation where I needed to get to the issue immediately instead of go through all the prompts. Each time I called, I got a new operator, I quickly explained my situation(lost/stolen card, calls keep dropping out, in a foreign country, etc), and each time they would insist on going through the prompts. Once the prompts were done, I would start explaining and then the call would drop and I'd have to repeat the process over and over. I know it's company policy but it was extremely annoying and frustrating. The operators themselves were polite as always. I have been recommending Ally to anybody in need of a new bank.",2015-05-29

Although I've turned to the internet for many services, I was hesitant to move all my banking online. But whenever I had a question (which was primarily in the beginning when setting up my accounts), I could reach someone through their easy to use website (chat feature) or by sending an email. And they had straight forward questions - I felt like It was a person and not a machine chatting with me. What I lose by switching to an online bank is the ability to deposit cash - but this day and age, how often do people carry cash?

I opened a savings account and a checking account with Ally. Even the checking account earns a bit of interest. Sure, it's not a huge percent but it's nice to see a return on giving your money to a bank to invest. Almost all banks these days like to act as though they're the ones doing you a service rather than you being the one giving them money to invest and profit from. The other unique thing about Ally is that you don't get charged for using ATMs anywhere--it's not just that Ally doesn't charge you, they actually reimburse you for service charges levied by other banks and ATMs.",2015-05-23
1303,Don't Rely On Them For Timely Transactions,21253,277,Ally Bank,23479,1,"Ally bank really let us down. We are supposed to close on our house Tuesday morning at 10:00 a.m. Today we finally get the HUD-1 statement outlining our closing costs. The only way to wire funds from Ally is to fax a form, which states at the top if the form is received and verified by 3:00pm your wire will be sent the same day. We faxed our form at 11:45 a.m. We called Ally around 2:00 to verify that it would be processed today - we were told yes, they had received it and would make sure it would happen today. We call again at 4:00 to verify that it went through and NOPE, it was not processed today and there is no longer anyone in the wire department. They were ""extremely busy"" so there was not even a supervisor for us to speak with. We were guaranteed a call back from a supervisor within an hour and that did not happen either. Our closing is now pushed until later in the day on Tuesday, with the hope that Ally will process it first thing on Tuesday- we'll see if that even happens. An online bank needs the staff to handle the quantity of requests they receive. Since Ally does not have physical banks, I cannot get my money any other way. As soon as this is settled we are closing our accounts at Ally. If you bank with Ally, don't count on anything happening in a timely manner.",2015-05-22

Directed to phone numbers by customer service and leave messages that are never returned. Try during business hours and no one answers. Absolutely aweful experience.

Everything was great for over 10 years then all the sudden I got a letter in the mail that said they were closing my account in 30 days. I had never caused them trouble, never once overdrew my account, never had any sort of problem. It must be a mistake! I called them right away and was willing to work out whatever problem they had with me. The customer service agent was surprised I received such a letter. He put me on hold for about half an hour then came back to say Ally doesn't want to do business with me anymore because they don't have to do business with me.

When I call Ally by phone, I speak to an actual human being very quickly. The customer service reps can quickly access my information and walk me through just about any transaction or issue. Of course, on a week to week basis the Ally website and mobile apps are sufficient to take care of all of my normal banking needs.

It also is very easy to link my checking account to it in order to transfer savings if I need it. I also have used the customer service several times and they are very helpful. They also have good security from what I can tell. I wish the interest was higher but it is better than my local credit union. They also have raised it since I have singed up. I also like how they have a calculator that shows how much interest you are getting per day, this provides good fuel to keep sending money.

When I opened my account with Ally it only took me about five minutes to fill out the application, which was great. One of my favorite things about Ally is that they don't charge a monthly fee.

I recently gave started doing research on opening a money market/CD account and had quite a few questions that I wanted answered to be able to compare to other banks. The service representative that I communicated with was extremely patient and knowledgeable and very forthcoming about their rates and (lack thereof) fees.

Both times the CSR took down all my information and assured me my ATM card would work, and if I had any problems all I had to do was call their customer service # collect.<br/><br/>In November I went to Rome and immediately tried my card only for it to get rejected. When I asked the front desk of the hotel how I could call America collect, they had no idea what I was saying. It was impossible to do such a thing. I had to spend an hour trying to find a ""phone center"" where I ended up paying over 10 euros because apparently there is no such thing as collect calls in Italy???<br/>After wasting an entire hour of my precious vacation I finally got an Allly CSR on the phone, and she said, ""Oh, the lady you spoke to before didn't do it right."" UNACCEPTABLE!<br/><br/>Then last week I went to London, and the exact same thing happened again. I called 3 days before I left and was assured my card would work. I mentioned the problem I had in Italy and was told oh no that's not going to happen again. Well, it most certainly did. And once again, I COULD NOT make a collect call from my hotel. I arrived late on a Friday night, and they were telling me I'd have to wait until Saturday morning to buy a BT calling card even to get an operator. Luckily they then allowed me to call directly from their phone, and this time the CSR saw absolutely no record of me calling to give my travel alert. And again, I wasted an entire hour of my precious vacation for this nonsense.

I don't think I'll ever go back to normal banking. Free checking and savings accounts with competitive interest rates means I can save a lot more than I could have with my previous bank. The actual process of creating the account was very simple, and transferring money to the account from my previous bank was a breeze. People who normally deposit cash into their accounts wouldn't find online banking useful, but for someone like me who does everything online anyway it's quite convenient.

They cannot be beaten when it comes to a good bank for business transactions. I opened a business checking account and it has been everything I hoped for. The low minimum balance requirements are great and allow me to shift money between banks without worrying about paying huge fees. I have called customer service a few times for some complicated transactions. I had no problem completing them and the banker walked me through all the steps. The bank is a breeze to use online. They have everything you would ever need including online access. Status and balance updates are great to receive and help you manage your money much better. Ally truly is a great bank. They work for you and they truly have your back.,2015-03-25
1318,Not Reliable Bank .System Is Wrought With Issues,20713,277,Ally Bank,22630,2,"I have had a checkings and savings with Ally for 5 years. Here is my experience.<br/><br/>In accurate transaction history - This is my most recent issue. I made a payment from my Discover credit card using my Ally account. Discover card says that the transaction failed because they could not locate the account. I then called Ally. I do not see the transaction debited from my account which is good as at least i didnt lose money. However, I DO see the transaction in my payment activity. Called Ally. Rep says they do not see the transaction in my payment activity. Another Ally rep called me the next day and still does not see the transaction. he told me to wait 2 days and it should show up. It's been 5 days. It still has not shown up. I find it very odd that I can see it in my payment activity, but they don't see it on their computer. This makes me question how accurate their systems are. I've seen other occasions where I see a payment in my payment activity, but no funds withdrawn. <br/><br/>Customer Service Not very knowledgeable - Ally has rated high on bank comparison sites b/c they have more ways to contact them than other banks. Question is what is the quality? The sales reps are nice and friendly. However, they have answered my question 20% of the times I have had to contact them. I'm in technology and seem to know more than they do about their systems. What's the use of being available 24/7 if you can't answer customer's q's?<br/> <br/>Bill Pay is not reliable - I have had repeatable issues with their ebill and bill pay. One time the account number changed. I edited the account number on the existing payee and got confirmation. Later I find I didn't get an ebill. since payment is triggered by the ebill, i missed the payment and got charged a $25 fee by the other company. After multiple attempts trying to figure out the issue myself, I called them. The rep seemed confused. After 30 minutes on the call, rep says, delete and recreate the payee. The system shouldn't let you change the account number of the payee if payments do not work after you change the account number right? Really poor design. I also have been charged missed payments due to payments not getting sent from Ally. And it is NOT due to not being enough money. Sometimes payments don't go through, like the example I mention below with Discover card. Now, I have given up using Ally as my central payment tool. I have had to set up a bank account at the 8 credit card and other accounts to pay from my bank account - this was what i was hoping to avoid. <br/><br/>Some Banks do not recognize Ally bank - I've tried to link my money market account with Ally and they could not recognize the bank. I should not have a doubt that other banks can recognize my primary checkings account right? <br/><br/><br/>Depositing checks on Android does not work well - They've had mobile check depositing since 2013 i believe. It worked fine the first year. Then I got a Samsung S4 which has a better camera than my previous phones. Once I switched to this phone, it became very difficult to upload a check. IF it worked it would take 4 to 5 attempts to get the app to accept the picture. Most of the time it simply would not. Would keep on getting blurry image error. Due to this, I ended up having to open another checkings account with a different bank so that I could deposit checks. Ridiculous. Finally yesterday, I asked them about this issue. They say they solved it. Can't say they made any updates to the mobile app itself, but at least now they recognize the issue and gave me instructions. Haven't tried it yet. I've used other mobile apps that did not have these problems.<br/><br/>Very slow Website - Ever since they did a make over of their website, it has been extremely slow. Some days it takes 12 seconds for each page to load. <br/><br/>If you don't use their bill pay, especially their automatic payment based on bill pay, you should be fine. Due to these issues, I am looking for a bank that is more reliable.",2015-03-24
1319,I love Ally,20550,277,Ally Bank,22428,5,"I have been with Ally for almost two years now, and I am liking them a lot. Customer service was excellent in setting up my account. I was very nervous about switching to an online back, because I thought I would feel uncomfortable not having a local branch if I needed something. But, they walked through the entire process. My only negatives are that when they did a system update it lasted most of a Saturday morning and I that was really a huge problem for me- not having access to your account with no warning on a weekend morning was a negative. I encourage everyone to check them out.",2015-03-13
1320,A Really Good Bank,20519,277,Ally Bank,22404,4,"I got with this bank four years ago. I had to cancel my account to my dismay because I got laid off and I just didn't have any money coming in. But they had really low fees, and they didn't nickle and dime me every time I used my card. Also the customer service was very nice to me whenever a problem came up.",2015-03-11
1321,No-fee online bank,20455,277,Ally Bank,22316,5,"I have had an online savings account with Ally Bank for about a year. It is the best savings account I have ever had. The account was very easy to set up through the online interface, which was a big consideration because I failed to open an account at a couple banks because I couldn't prove my own identity through their procedures. Advantages of the account are the fact that deposits post sooner than at other banks I have used, the fact that they refund all ATM fees, and the fact that I've never had to pay any fee for anything. Additionally, almost everything can be done through the online interface. I've only had to call once and their customer service was very helpful. The only disadvantage I experienced is the fact that the web site seems to be down for maintenance a little more often than I would like. I have a tendency to check the account at odd hours and it's always up during business hours, but it's down on more late nights than I would like. I initially expected the lack of physical branches to be a disadvantage, but I really don't miss them at all.",2015-03-05

1323,Ally: A smart choice for savers,20441,277,Ally Bank,22307,5,"I've been banking with Ally Bank for a few years now and I really love it. In fact, if my mortgage weren't tied to another local land bank, I would do all my banking with Ally. As it is, I have a money market savings account and 3 retirement accounts with Ally. Savings interest rates at Ally are higher than at the land-based banks that I am familiar with. If you have a checking account with Ally, they will reimburse you for any ATM fees you incur when using local ATMs. Also, there are truly no hidden fees. Everything is spelled out in the website, clearly and concisely, including interest rates, fees, limits on transfers, types of accounts available, etc. <br/> <br/>The website is easy to use and seems very secure. I can make transfers among my various Ally accounts and from and to my non-Ally account, or transfer money to another person with just a few clicks of the mouse. <br/> <br/>I've only had occasion to speak to customer service once--when I wanted to close another on-line account to transfer the balance to Ally (the other bank offered less interest on savings)--and the representative was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, in short, excellent. I would not hesitate to contact customer service again if needed (they have phone contact and on-line chat, plus you can secure email them or even send snail mail), however, the website is so complete and easy to use that it really hasn't been necessary in the two or three years I've been with the bank.",2015-03-05
1324,My experience with Ally Bank,20214,277,Ally Bank,22022,5,"I have been an Ally customer for just over a year now. This is my first bank account. When i was looking for a bank i thought I wanted a brick and mortar bank. I don't make a lot of money so I needed a bank that didn't have a ton of fees. Looking into other banks I found fee's, taxes. all kinds of excuses to take your money. So I saw ally had no fees. Not only do they have no fee's they give you money back. You gain interest, They refund ATM fees charged by other banks. I also get free checks and smart-phone check deposits. You can also scan checks for deposits. The website as well as the app is simple to use, Clear and concise. I could not be more happy with my choice. <br/> <br/>My experience with customer service has always been amazing as well. I never wait longer than a minute or less to speak with a real English speaking person. They always seemed to have a genuine interest in solving my problems and answering my questions. They have always been extremely friendly even when i felt like my question was stupid. <br/> <br/>I would recommend Ally to anyone, and in fact I have. A friend of mine just recently opened an Ally account. He is really happy with it.",2015-02-16
1325,This Is What A Bank Should Be Like,20145,277,Ally Bank,21929,5,"I have an account with Ally Bank. They are not available locally in my state, however, I wouldn't chance to give this bank up for anything else. I had no problem updating my information when I moved to another state. I had no problems with the security codes being delivered via mobile phone or via email. If there was potentially a problem, I always had an adequate experience with a live chat representative or a customer service representative over the phone. There was a maximum of a 1-2 minute wait time to get a real person to talk to which I value very much. I haven't had the best time with other banks because of that reason. Ally Bank also reimburses you at the end of each month for any ATM fees that accrue. Even more impressive, anytime I transfer money from any online account to my Ally Bank, it takes less than 3 days for the deposit to post. Ally also has competitive interest rates. Like anything else, the higher your average/maintained daily balance is, the more interest you will receive. Just overall, I am a happy customer. I am sure that other Ally Bankers know exactly what I am talking about.",2015-02-11
1326,Good experience with Ally Bank,19938,277,Ally Bank,21676,5,"I've been with Ally Bank for about a year and a half, and so far all of my experiences have been positive. When I joined, there was either no minimum deposit or a very minimal one (I don't recall exactly, but I know I didn't need to make a large deposit.) My first set of checks were free, and the most appealing thing is that all ATM withdrawals are free. Not only does Ally not charge me a fee, but they also refund the charge that the ATM charges me at the end of my billing cycle. ATM fees these days can be pretty outrageous, so Ally refunding the fees is a huge perk. <br/> <br/>I haven't had to deal with customer service too many times, but both times I did, they were very helpful. The first time, I had trouble activating my new debit card because I wasn't sure which code I was supposed to enter, but the person who spoke to me when I called customer assistance was very helpful. Another time, I'd forgotten my password for the website and had to call to get it reset, and the process was fairly simple. I just had to verify few secret questions and my information, and they were able to reset it for me. <br/> <br/>My experiences with Ally Bank have all been good, and based on my experiences, I can recommend them to others.",2015-01-30
1327,Terrible Bank!,19780,277,Ally Bank,21491,1,"My boyfriend and I have had a checking and savings account through Ally for a few years, and we just can't take it anymore. We've gone back with Suntrust and are in the process of switching over our funds and direct deposits, which Ally is not making easy for us. <br/><br/>They are SLOW at everything. We used to have Bank of America, and their application for mobile deposits was great and the money was available the next business day. With Ally, we almost always have to wait several days. And now, as a punishment for overdrafting our checking a couple times in the past year (we had overdraft protection from our savings but I guess Ally still takes it personal) Ally is holding any check we deposit randsom for 5 business days. Since I am switching, I had changed my direct deposit info through work, and because the process takes a while, my work sent me a paper check until direct deposit into my new account was ready. We used the app to deposit it into our Ally account (since we didn't have debit cards yet for our Suntrust account), and it is showing that check included in our balance... however, our ""available balance"" does not include the check. There's a note that the check is being held due to ""excessive overdrafts."" (two... in a year... that were paid from my own savings account!) Now for a week we don't have access to MY PAYCHECK! This is one of the most BS practices I've ever heard of and it's infuriating. <br/><br/>Also, the savings account we used to have through Ally was suddently closed without warning because we were transferring money too often throughout the month. We had both our paychecks set up to put 10% into savings, and if we wanted to make a large purchase that month or splurge on something, we would transfer from savings. Apparently there is a limit on the number of transactions you can make from a savings account (all banks may have this?) and because we exceeded that limit, we were fined... and because it happened again months later, Ally closed the account and gave no notice. One day we logged on and the account just said CLOSED. We had to call to find out why. They eventually mailed a check for what was in the account when it was closed (that you have to use the app to deposit so they can hold it randsom!), and both my and my boyfriend's direct deposits got screwed up and 10% of our paychecks went who knows where... I think mine was added to my next paycheck and he got a paper check in the mail weeks later. <br/><br/>For being an online bank, Ally sure does have a lot of technical issues. I use their Popmoney service to pay rent, and it takes about 5 business days to process the payment... not impressive. Sometimes this service isn't working, and we have to make other arrangements with the landlord because who knows when Ally will fix it. Then occassionally their online banking site and the mobile application will have an error message when you try to log in saying they are having technical issues with their online banking services and to check back later. But you're an online bank Ally... if you're having issues with your online services, you're JUST HAVING ISSUES. It's not like there's a branch your customers can go to to make transfers or check their balances. This saturday their site had that message for most of the day. Rediculous. They want to punish you with fees and inconveniences for your mistakes but just give you an ""oops, sorry"" for theirs. <br/><br/>Another HUGE problem with this bank is that without branches, you can't deposit cash if you ever need to, and you can't deposit certain kind of checks through the app. You have to MAIL these checks to Ally and then wait for them to process... My boyfriend got an insurance payment check for his car that was totaled and we needed to start looking for a new one so he could get to work. Before we even tried the app he called to make sure it would work so we didn't get stuck waiting for a deposit that was never going to happen. The customer service rep said we'd have to mail the check to Ally for it to be deposited... almost two weeks later we finally had the money in our account. Likewise, if you are ever paid in cash for something, or receive gift money, there's no way for you to use that money to pay online bills(without going to Amscot), shop online, add it to savings, etc. When we were with BOA and I was making tip money I could pop it into an ATM and it would be available in my account immediately. You're just screwed with Ally, unless you have someone you can give the money to who will write you a check, and then you want to wait 5 business days to access it. <br/><br/>Ally is just a really crappy bank. It starts out seeming really convenient and nice because of the low fees(other banks still have lower fees), but it's just not worth it. There are far too many inconvenient things about it and the way they treat you like a child who can't manage your money responsibly so they have to punish you... it just doesn't give you any warm, fuzzy feelings for them. I'm so glad we're switching. I have some student loan money I'm expecting to be deposited from my grad school soon, and I'm looking forward to what a fiasco it will be to transfer that to my new bank. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, and even if you don't think you'll ever need a physical branch for your banking, go with a bank that has one anyways. It's so easy for Ally to treat its customers like shit because they never have to see any of them face-to-face. They're not people, they're just customer numbers. There is value in having an in-person customer service option. It may seem like this value is lost in the age of technology, but I've learned the hard way never to take it for granted.",2015-01-18
1328,Closed my account for no reason,19731,277,Ally Bank,21412,1,"I had been an Ally customer for over 10 years, never had a problem.

The process was EASY! There were NO maintenance fees, NO opening minimum and they have a nationwide network of ATMs to withdraw money and make deposits. This is the perfect bank account for the 21st century and (fingers crossed) the perfect bank for me! I have yet to open the original savings account I went in search of because their checking seemed that great! But I am planning to do so in the next week. <br/> <br/>I have already started to tell my friends of Allybank and will continue to do so as long as they stay this awesome and easy to use.",2015-01-13

1331,Great Primary Bank,19553,277,Ally Bank,21155,5,"Ally is the best online bank if your only needs are checking and savings accounts. For my other banking needs, I maintain a small second account at a local Credit Union. Ally has the most competitive interest rates, and since I keep more than $15K in my checking account it has a higher interest rate than most savings accounts. I enjoy not paying for my checks, since I use exactly one check a month for rent. My credit union wants to charge me $30 for a package of 300. Why would I need that many? Ally makes it easy for me to transfer money to my credit union accounts (for free) or to friends (also for free via PopMoney.) The only time I use Ally's mobile app is when I am depositing a check. That mobile check deposit is a really convenient feature, but doesn't let me control my camera flash, so it can take some lighting setup. For Andorid, they have not updated the app in quite some time, so I tend to avoid it. My girlfriend uses the iOS app and it's really sleek. Whether online or on mobile, they have their call center wait time listed, and I have never waited more than two minutes before reaching an actual human. There are a couple of negatives. For one, they do not do loans unless it's for a GM branded car. They do not do mortgages. And to deposit cash requires sending in an envelop. But these are not everyday banking needs in my life, and why I maintain a small second account with my local credit union. In summation, high interest rates, an easy to use website, and quick customer service are the three reasons that I am super happy with Ally as my primary bank. Oh, and I almost forgot one of the best parts! I rarely use cash, but in the rare instance that I need some (Vegas!) I can rest easy knowing that any ATM fees I run into will be reimbursed to me at the end of the month. Thanks Ally!",2015-01-01

1335,Ally Bank - Customer Review,19219,277,Ally Bank,20794,5,"I've had nothing but success working with Ally Bank since I switched over last year. The fact that they have interest checking was a huge plus over the local bank I had been using. In addition, they reimburse any and all ATM fees, since they have no branches themselves. This really came in handy when I was on a trip to New Orleans, and needed money on Bourbon Street. The ATM fee as $6, but it was reimbursed by Ally at the end of the month. In addition, their customer service is second to none. They advertise and market themselves as a bank where you're able to talk to a real person at any time, and it's very true. I was preparing for an overseas trip not too long ago, and was able to reach someone immediately to let them know that I would be in 2 different countries over the next several weeks. It really helped having the ability to get in touch with someone right away. Their system for ordering new checks is also really convenient, and they allow customers to order 50 at a time for free.

I wrote to them about wanting to receive checks and had a reply within a day saying the checks were on their way. The Ally mobile app is not the most appealing app when it comes to attractiveness, but it is extremely simple and easy to use and does not use much data. I like that Ally Bank has no fees on the checking account, whereas many comparable banks do have fees.

That did not happen.<br/> After many phone calls and even speaking with about FIVE different ""supervisors"" they were not going to put the money back any time soon, nor were they going to cover even one of the over draft fees.

Free debit card replacements, free checks, fast and friendly customer support, apps on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. <br/> <br/>It is a great online bank that should be tried for those looking a new bank.

But I was so happy with their interest rates and service that a few months ago, I gave up my other checking account and made Ally my primary account.<br/><br/>I'm learning that this was a mistake. The rates and service are still good, but the bill pay has been a thorn in my side. Twice, they've sent utility payments in a different amount than what I requested - they were only a few cents off each time, thankfully, but it was still unnerving. What if they make a bigger mistake someday? <br/><br/>More worrisome is that I am typing this review on November 3rd, and my landlord still doesn't have my rent payment that was scheduled to arrive on October 31st. Ally debits on the scheduled delivery date, too - so the money isn't in my account, but my landlord doesn't have it either. Which just stinks for everybody involved. This is the second time this has happened since I switched to Ally as my primary account. <br/><br/>I could blame USPS, but this never happened once in all the years I did autopay with my previous checking account.

1346,STAY AWAY!,18668,277,Ally Bank,20087,1,"On this surface, this bank promotes themselves as being friendly and easy to work with. That is true until you have your first problem with them. When you try to contact customer service regarding your problem, you will be lied to. The customer service rep will tell you that they can help you with your problem, that they will notate your account, and that the solution you and they came up with will be fine. They've just lied to you. The bank will start sending you threatening letters at least once a week. When you call back and talk to a supervisor about the problem and tell them what the previous customer service representative said, they will tell you that nobody at the bank has the authority to make an agreement regarding your problem. They then will tell you there are no notes or anything on your account to show you even called in previously. They will tell you that the problem has to be solved now, right that second, no matter what the other customer service representative said. If you can't solve it that second they will become rude. The bank will place holds on accounts that family members have with this bank for MORE than the amount in question. (In my case, the amount in question was $48. I paid part of it back and was waiting on my check for the rest of it. They placed a hold on my mother's account for $48 and refused to remove it.) It was a nightmare trying to deal with this bank for a problem that they started by double debiting a funds transfer. I had banked with this bank for over 3 years and as soon as this issue was cleared up I closed my accounts and my mother closed her accounts. This bank will treat you like trash.",2014-10-29
1347,"Ally Bank, know what you're getting",18667,277,Ally Bank,20086,4,"Ally Bank offers a lot of great stuff. I saw it online and thought I'd give it a shot. After a few months of using it I've come to the conclusion that it's a decent alternative to regular banking as long as you understand it's shortcomings. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>Like most online banks it's very difficult to make a deposit, aside from direct deposit from your place of employment. Also, since the risk of fraud are so much higher, they are extremely tight about overdrafts and will hold your checks for 5 days if you are negative once on your account. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>If that is alright, the benefits are great. Using any atm comes in handy more often than you'd imagine. Also, they've got great rates on savings accounts, which I highly recommend.",2014-10-29
1348,The best interest rate,18436,277,Ally Bank,19799,5,"I have a savings account with Ally bank. They were the only online bank that I could find that gave me a savings account that had a debit card to go with it and I also get 0.85 interest per year and my interest rate grows every year to. All the other online banks that I looked at did not have savings accounts like this. The other banks only offered a debit card and checkbook with a 0.10 interest rate checking account. With the Ally account I get a 0.85 interest rate,debit card and a checkbook and I get the interest rate of a savings account. Also they have no ATM fees at all and if I get charged a fee they refund it at the end of the month. I called customer service and ask them about it and they said "" We wont charge you to get your money thats not right"" so even if I do get an ATM charge they will refund it at the end of the month. All of my experiences with customer service have been great and very reassuring. The customer service representatives were more than helpful and they know what they are doing. Ally bank is great. You wont find a better deal.",2014-10-24
1349,Wonderful Banking Experience,18431,277,Ally Bank,19794,5,I saw that Ally was offering a better savings rate than my credit union so I thought I would give them a try. They are so easy to work with. Their website is very easy to use and if you have a question you can actually call them. They actually answer the phone. Their customer service is fantastic.,2014-10-23
1350,Satisfied.,18426,277,Ally Bank,19789,3,I have been a customer of Ally for several years now. I first opened an account at a branch in 2009. Since then my experience with Ally has been at a minimum satisfactory. I have always been able to easily perform transactions such as deposits and withdrawals. It is also extremely quick and easy to transfer money to one account to another. One of my issues with the bank is a shortage of ATM and branch locations. If this were improved upon I would be very happy with Ally.,2014-10-22
1351,Allied with Ally,18423,277,Ally Bank,19786,5,"Ally Bank is the first online bank that I ever used. It was a big deal at the time as not many banks didn't have brick and mortar fronts. I thought I would miss the security of being able to go into a bank. What I realized is that I hate going to banks. It's almost never a positive experience and Ally has provided me with that, a positive experience. <br/> <br/>The best thing you can say about a bank is that they never make mistakes. Ally has never made a mistake with me. I would recommend them to anyone.",2014-10-22
1352,Ally Bank is Great Bank,18422,277,Ally Bank,19785,5,"Ally Bank provides one of the best interest rates for savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. As an Internet bank, the money you can earn on your savings is far better than what you would earn at a traditional bank. There are almost no fees at Ally Bank. I have had an account at this bank for many years, and have never received a fee for anything. There is no minimum amount necessary to keep the account open, and no transfer fees. So if you want to transfer money in and out of your checking account, they will not charge you anything. They have the best customer service as well. If you call them, they quickly answer the phone, and give you an estimate of your waiting time. The 'chat' feature of their online banking is especially helpful, quick, and convenient.",2014-10-21
1353,Very Satisfied New Customer,18421,277,Ally Bank,19784,4,"I recently signed up for a savings account. So far, the experience has been great. I chose my savings account on their website and signed up pretty quickly for the account. The interest rate for the account is great-one percent-and I deposited two dollars to open it. They didn't specify a deposit amount requirement to open the account. <br/>A couple weeks later I received a packet in the regular snail mail that I needed to send back regarding my signature card. This was required so the IRS didn't require the bank to withhold money from my account for interest. <br/>The online experience with this bank has been great so far. I haven't interacted with customer service representatives yet. I noticed that this bank offers the option to send money to others via their email, which I thought was a nice benefit too. I haven't looked into all the ""perks"" they offer, but overall, I'm very pleased with this bank.",2014-10-21

I over-drafted my account twice, once in Jan., and once in March. My fault I know, pay the fee and move on, no big deal! Until I made a deposit by phone in late March, they held the deposit for 5 business days quoting ""excessive overdrafts""???? Two??? Then again in May same thing with no additional overdrafts . That was enough for me. I figured I over drafted I pay the fee as my punishment and it was over, not with Ally!",2014-10-18
1356,Simple and Awesome,18388,277,Ally Bank,19751,5,"After a decade of dealing with Bank of America I am so glad that I finally made the dive into online banking. Ally bank has been nothing but a pleasure to work with since I first opened an account with them. I really felt nickel and dimed with Bank of America but with Ally Bank there are practically no fees. They even have an interest rate on a checking account, not much but better than the nothing most brick and mortar banks give you. I can withdraw my money from a host of ATM's easily and free and with their mobile app I can deposit checks, so I literally have no reason to go inside a bank again. I love Ally!",2014-10-14

Today with banks there is no need to have to go to a branch technology is allowing you to do all your bills and banking via online. The ally app I use daily to check my balances and see when my deposits hit the bank, very good app, and whenever I've needed information there support is awesome and responds back in a timely manner.",2014-10-14

1359,Great Experience,18376,277,Ally Bank,19740,5,"I've been using Ally bank for about two years now, and have never had any bad experiences. When I first setup my account, I was offered a $50 account opening bonus, which I received less than a week after my account was activated. I've never had any issues with inexplicable fees showing up -- in fact I don't believe I've ever been charged a fee by Ally. The interface is clean and easy-to-use. Everything with Ally is simple and straight-forward. Overall, I feel that Ally's one of the best banks around.",2014-10-12

1361,Ally Checking Account,18367,277,Ally Bank,19731,4,"I chose to bank with Ally after having searched the internet for a while for the best reviews of banks and their products. Ally had appealing interest rates-which are extremely hard to come by lately-and their reviews boasted of their great customer service and quality of products. I like using Ally because it is convenient to use online and has the features I like. It is not complicated at all. The only thing that I don't like (which is the same with most banks) is that when I initiate a transfer to or from my other accounts at a different bank, it takes days to complete. That is a bit inconvenient. But their customer service line is great, they send me anything I need or request right away, and they take a great interest in their customers and how they can be of assistance. The card is fantastic and has never given me any problems, and, again, the interest rate is great on this checking account compared to rates on accounts at my other bank. I'm very pleased with Ally, and will continue to explore and use their services. I would recommend them to a friend or family member.",2014-10-10

I originally signed up for an account with Ally because of their rates, but eventually I really began to appreciate how easy Ally was to use. When I set up my account, customer service representatives reached out to me to assist me with learning how to use their site.

Whenever we renew a cd we get .25% extra for continueing with them, which is nice, since I haven't found any rates with banks I trust higher lately.

Their website is easy to navigate and I am always able to find the information that I want, I love that I can go paperless and they have copies of my statements going back to when I first opened the account. I had a great experience with the staff when I applied for a car loan with them, they were friendly and knowledgeable about the different rates and helped work with me to qualify for the lowest interest rate. I will definitely work with them again in the future.",2014-09-29
1368,Excellent banking experiences,18089,277,Ally Bank,19325,5,"Ally Bank is the best bank that I have ever worked with! I have been a member there for less than a year, however in comparison to other banks, their services and customer service are far superior, and their mobile website is the best. There is 24 hour customer service by phone or by chat, and they are very friendly and helpful in every aspect of the business. I can not give this bank enough stars, they go above and beyond the call of duty in everything that I have experienced, I'm so glad I found them and recommend them to everyone I know.",2014-09-26
1369,Low Fee Internet Bank,17985,277,Ally Bank,19174,5,"I got sick of my original bank because I kept getting charged outrageous fees. For example, I was overdrawn in my checking account though my savings account had plenty of money. I was over by $2.00 and got charged a $30 fee. With Ally as long as you're overdrawn less than $10 you don't get charged anything. And I believe the fee for overdrawing is a a small percentage of what other banks charge. Plus, I was hit by fraud during Christmas time. So enough was enough. I decided signing up for Ally was easy enough. I absolutely love the mobile check deposit. They also have a program called Pop Money where you can transfer money to your bills or even personal accounts. I sent some money to my mom and it worked great free of charge. Also you get a certain number of fee reimbursements for ATMs every month which makes it very convenient though they do not have their own ATMs as far as I know. Customer service has been awesome when I had to call them, I was connected with a person immediately. Online banking is simple and reliable. So far I'm impressed with this bank.",2014-09-17

1371,Review of Ally Bank,17706,277,Ally Bank,18751,4,"This bank has good telephone customer service. The website is fairly good, and ease of use is reasonable online. There are no big drawbacks.

1372,Amazing Online Checking from Ally,17705,277,Ally Bank,18750,5,I was referred to Ally Bank from a coworker. I was looking for a checking account that offered a non-zero APY and had plenty of ATMs in my city. After looking at Ally's website I was instantly hooked. I called up customer service and they were very helpful and friendly. They helped me create a checking account and helped me move money into that account from my current bank. I was very happy with their prompt support and everything was completed in under 30 minutes. I received my debit card and checks about 4 days later and everything was ready to go. I highly recommend Ally to anyone looking for an online bank with excellent service.,2014-08-28
1373,Great Customer Service not Amazing Product though,17699,277,Ally Bank,18744,3,"I've banked with Ally for over two years, holding a variety of accounts, but mostly a high-interest savings about. My interest rate on the savings account started at around 2% but is now down to less than .5%. I think this is beyond lame, given the relationship I've built with the bank. That being said I love Ally's customer service, it's 24/7 and I've always had zero issues in regards to wait times.",2014-08-28
1374,Great for Saving,17696,277,Ally Bank,18741,4,Ally bank is an online bank wth very competitive interest rates that makes saving very easy. They reimburse you for ATM fees which makes accessing your money not a problem. Although they have a dedicated customer hot line it can be a wait sometime and it doesn't have the convience of a physical bank. Still if you don't need a physical bank it is a great bank to go with.,2014-08-28
1375,100% Happy With Ally,17692,277,Ally Bank,18737,5,"I am also a TD customer and one thing I need to mention to Ally customers is that TD bank seems to block Ally from using their ATM's Every time I go into a TD bank after placing my Ally card in, suddenly the ATM is out of service and spits my card out. It stays that way for a few minutes then goes back to normal. I think its because Ally doesn't let them charge us fees. anyway Ally has ben 100% accurate and 100% friendly and eager to help. Its great to finally have a bank that isn't looking for ways to steal my money.",2014-08-27
1376,Saving Review,17649,277,Ally Bank,18635,4,"I have a savings account with Ally bank. I have to say initially it scared me to just give all in my information over the internet and make transfers. I usually prefer to have confirmations with people so I'm 100% sure where my money is going. After the initial skepticism I found myself to really enjoy online banking, it was extremely easy to get my money transferred to other accounts and I enjoyed the ease of being able to do it from work or home. I received multiple confirmations and was able to track progress on the website. I contacted customer service once because my account was locked due to incorrect password attempts and they were efficient and I didn't wait on hold forever. They also have an estimated wait time on the home page which is very helpful.",2014-08-24
1377,"Best rates, good service, but a bad mobile app",17647,277,Ally Bank,18632,4,"I have banked with Ally Bank since 2010. I was initially attracted by their CD and interest checking account rates, as these were higher than the national average at the time. While they have come down significantly during the recession, they still have rates that are competitive with or better than what you will find at a Big Four bank. <br/> <br/>Ally has 24 hour customer service online, which is great. Ally also has a secure email system within your account portal for direct questions that cannot be resolved by an attendant. The few times I've had to use this feature, I received a response within a business day. <br/> <br/>Ally is an internet-only bank, which means there are no physical locations to go to to deposit checks, talk to representatives or handle any problems. Most of the time, this isn't a problem, as the online experience is great and you can deposit checks by mail. However, the mobile experience was initially terrible. The iPhone app that was available was buggy and crashed routinely. Until recently, it didn't even have a direct deposit of a check by photo, which many other banks do have. Thankfully, that was fixed and it is a feature on the app. <br/> <br/>Ally provides free standard checks, which is great, and reimburses all fees at all ATMs nationwide - from a competing bank or from a standalone ATM at a gas station, it does not matter. This feature is one of the best things about my account and one of the reasons I don't want to leave. <br/> <br/>Overall, Ally has many more positives than negatives. I'd give it a solid 4/5, with a 5/5 if the app ever gets up to where it could be.",2014-08-24
1378,Extremely good customer service.,17544,277,Ally Bank,18440,5,"Ally has been a great bank to work with. They are always accessible (chat, email, or phone) and bend over backwards to please their customers. They have on many occasions waived fees or charges if I simply call and have been very fair. I would recommend their services to most people that use traditional brick and mortar banks that CHARGE you to be an account holder.",2014-08-16
1379,Alright,17538,277,Ally Bank,18434,4,"My auto loan is through Ally. I've had not trouble working with them as of yet. Their fees are moderate. When I was hurt at work, fell down some steps, broke my finger, and sprained my knee... they worked with me on late payments, and allowed me to delay two. I find them understanding, and not annoying. Some banks, when you are late one day call three times/day. Any problems I've had, I've just called them, and they've help me set something up, or taken care of it. Pleasure to do business with.",2014-08-15
1380,Best Online Bank in the US,17533,277,Ally Bank,18429,4,"Ally Bank's philosophy is to ensure the consumers' banking satisfaction. Even though they are an online bank -- meaning no physical branch, They have free ATM access (you can call them to reimburse if charged) and 24 hour customer service. The representatives are very friendly and helpful. The ease of application is very welcoming. Also, they do not have a minimum amount required when opening an account. The best thing is their interest rates are the highest in the United States. I think if you are to apply for an online bank, you should consider this wonderful institution.",2014-08-14
1381,Ally Review,17530,277,Ally Bank,18426,5,"Ally banking has been a breath of fresh air with regard to my personal finance.

1382,Happy for 3 Years!,17529,277,Ally Bank,18425,4,"I have been a customer of Ally Bank for close to three years now. I sought out their services at a time when I was in need of a new bank and needed a new account practically immediately. I searched several different banks that offered online banking until I finally met my match with Ally. I was able to apply for an account and it was approved and opened within one day. For the two types of accounts that I currently utilize, checking and savings, there is no initial deposit required which was a very big plus for me. It can get hard finding an ATM at times that you can use with Ally but I mostly do cash back with my purchases, though the ATM Finder is a nice tool to help compatible ATM's and establishments that offer cash back. Cash back does incur a charge at certain places but Ally will reimburse you for such charges. <br/>I usually deposit my checks on my computer, I used the app when I had an Android phone. It was very easy and convenient to deposit my checks with the Ally app for Android. I miss that ability now that I am using a Blackberry and it would be nice if there was an app available for that platform. Ally is very generous about overdraft fees as well, i have over-drafted my account about three times within the past year, each time my account was replenished in about a day and I wasn't charged for the mistake. Overall Ally has been very convenient and reliable, I have never been charged a fee since I've used this bank, it is very user friendly and provides a great experience. I doubt that I would be as happy with any other bank.",2014-08-13
1383,Ally Bank - Excellent Customer Service!,17471,277,Ally Bank,18323,4,"I switched to Ally about a year ago, because I was moving to a new city due to work and wasn't sure what local banks existed. I am so happy I went with Ally - competitive rates on my Savings account, and interest Checking for one thing. Also, all ATM fees are refunded completely, and the phone number you call for customer service leads to a real person. I went overseas for a business trip, and they were extremely courteous on my call to them. I had no problems at all using my card in 2 different countries. The turnaround from submitting a deposit via smartphone app to seeing the money show up in my account is under 48 hours. This is a great bank, and I couldn't imagine switching to another online bank company.",2014-08-11
1384,A Convenient and Modern Bank,17304,277,Ally Bank,18004,5,"After being with a small local bank in my hometown since I was 16, a cross country move prompted me to look for a new bank. I was very pleasantly surprised to see the awesome option of online banking. I love to be able to check my balance online, make transfers, and so on. My Ally account is FREE! In addition to that, I have had ZERO problems with anything since opening the account 6 months ago. I can check on my money anytime, anywhere. I thought I would switch to an ""in person"" bank after moving but I changed my mind -- sticking with Ally!",2014-07-30
1385,Great bank with minor drawbacks.,17302,277,Ally Bank,18002,5,"I have been with ally for roughly 2 years as of now. They offer very competitive interest rates while not blindsiding you with excessive fees like many banks that charge low balance fees. I have found their customer service to be extremely help, but definitely a little chatty. Their website is very easy to use, depositing checks online can sometimes have a few hiccups depending on your browser and scanner. I found the mobile app for android to be of disappointing quality because it is merely a port of the iPhone version.",2014-07-30

I wasn't sure how working with an online bank would go, but it's been great! No real fees for anything, reimbursed ATM fees, helpful customer service available via phone and online chat 24/7, and amazing web and mobile features. I love being able to deposit a check by taking a picture of it with my phone. The only downside is not being able to deposit cash, but we have cash so rarely that it's not really an issue for us at all.",2014-07-30
1387,Bad Service,17389,277,Ally Bank,18178,1,"The worst customer service in my life. One department doesn't know what the other is doing. Added extra charges to my car payments and no one could tell me what the charges were for. I wrote letters(3) and got no reply until I wrote a fourth letter. Customer service was poor, very poor. I know they say my account is behind. Pay every month before time. This is a sorry company. Need to retrain your reps. I was QA for GE for 10 years, I would fire over half of them. Don't use this to get a car. No one ever says SORRY. Never send me a notice as to what the charges were for. I was told we don't do that. Why? should I pay for something I don't know what it's for. Especially when my payments are on time. This is no way to run a business",2014-07-29

I am uncertain if other banks allow customers to have a new card for any reasons, but My bank does and there is NEVER a charge.",2014-07-25
1389,Overall I love this bank!,17288,277,Ally Bank,17988,5,"I really love my savings account! For beginners, you don't need a minimum deposit to even open an account with them. This really helped me get a jump on savings because I was able to open the account before I got the money. There are no crazy fees and they make it easy to deposit and transfer money online. The interest rate isn't so bad. The only thing I wish was better was that it takes 3-5 days to transfer funds out of the savings account. Then again, this might be to deter you from withdrawing ;) I would recommend this bank to anyone!",2014-07-25

1403,Warning Re: Ally Bank And FDIC Info Being Given By Phone Reps,15991,277,Ally Bank,3825,1,"Today is Jan 30, 2014.<br/><br/>In the past, I was a very pleased with Ally Bank services and phone service agents. This afternoon, I had to call for service as my online account access was blocked due to no contact for ""quite a while"". It took two calls to get the access unlocked. Both service agents were courteous. However, during the conversation, the first rep called mentioned that each of my accounts was FDIC insured for the $250 k amount. I have several accounts with Ally including CD/s, checking and savings accounts. The total for all accounts is more than $250 k. All accounts have identical account ownership. I mentioned to rep one that I thought that he was in error and that I was partially uninsured. No, rep one was very certain. The dialog continued and then he reread a ""Guide"" he had, out loud to me, and then when parsing the words and more dialog, he recanted his prior statements that all of my six accounts had $250 k each for a total of 1.5 million dollars. Later, still working on the lockout, I had to call Ally again to resolve the problem. Rep 2 did accomplish the unlock, and I asked rep 2 how much FDIC insurance coverage did I have, and he came back with the same initial response as rep 1 - $250 k for each of my six identically registered accounts. I suggested a different interpretation, but unlike rep 1, rep 2 stayed firm and mentioned that the FDIC had a worksheet I could run. End if ALLY contacts. I ran the FDIC tool and yes, I was uninsured for all amounts greater than $250 k. Just to make sure, I called the FDIC and that rep confirmed that the worksheet was correct. <br/><br/>Bottom Line for readers with accounts at Ally with amounts greater than $250 total - I recommend that you confirm your FDIC insurance coverage with the FDIC worksheet and a call to the FDIC if necessary. Granted a sample of two account reps at Ally this afternoon is just two, but there is a problem there at Ally - 2 for 2 misstatements re: FDIC coverage.<br/><br/>Be aware! The link for the FDIC tool was at http://www.fdic.gov/EDIE/calculator.html <br/><br/>Cheers!",2014-01-30

Two days ago, I found 2 fraudulent transactions (from Bangladesh - go figure) and notified Ally immediately. They refused to take the complaint because the transactions were not fully complete and elected to make me re-contact them two days later (guess it was just way too much trouble to take down the information and act on it in 2 days). I called back in 2 days to *finally* get the 'investigation' started and was told Ally will snail mail me forms within TEN business days to return. As far as the funds? Well, they will be 'provisionally' returned when the 00'investigation' officially starts (hopefully in 10 days assuming they actually mail them and I don't have to call back in to start the process all over again). <br/><br/>I asked the csr if it was ok, then, for me to overdraft my accounts by $800 (the amount of the bad transactions) and just respond to Ally that I would make a provisional deposit withing 10 business days to cover the amount.<br/><br/>Ally should stop wasting all of the millions they are spending on 'how great their customer service is' if this is how they truly treat their customers.

I said to the person on the phone, can I just remove the link to the PayPal account?

To me, that is the most unprofessional way to treat a customer, I will never do business with Ally.com, that is the only thing I can do, because I can never take back the sleepless nights after they left me with late bills and wondering when I would get my payroll paper check instead of the direct deposit I had entrusted to them.  :-(",2013-07-27
1409,Ancient Banking Services,14408,277,Ally Bank,13697,1,"I am a fairly new customer with Ally. This is the worse Checking Account I have ever had. I diverted from the big banks (BofA, Wells Fargo, etc) due to their malicious practices of labeling low-balance customers and taking advantage of their lack of cash flow. A vendor erroneously debited my account. I contact the vendor and Ally and the Ally refunded the overdraft fee and the vendor agreed to return the funds. The vendor took over a month to return my funds. When I did received the refund, Ally decided to hold it for 7 days stating the hold was due to me having a recent overdraft. WAIT, the same d*** overdraft you refunded? And also, the deposit is for that same d*** transaction? Really??? So I chat online, and ""Rihanna"" was obviously the singer, and not banking associate as she refused to understand the case and help me further. So I called the 800 number and at first, was labeled with stereotypes that ""a lot of people have holds because they have multiple overdrafts"". I had to encourage the associate to review my account before labeling me as a repeat offended. There, she found that the only overdraft fee I had received was for THIS incident, which was refunded by the bank and original debit was returned. FINALLY got her to enter a request to remove the hold from my account. She also found that Ally had my account labeled as having received 6 or 7 overdrafts, of which she was unable to locate any others accept the one refunded. It would behoove them to take the necessary steps to review the customer's account before assuming their situation fits the punishment. So disgusted. I am dropping my payroll direct deposit with the checking account and will only use it to transfer funds to/from the MMA to avoid delays with transferring between banking institutions. <br/><br/> Signed, Disgruntled and Turned Off",2013-07-10
1410,Failure Of Edeposit System,13893,277,Ally Bank,13296,1,"I have appreciated everything about my Ally accounts except for their eDeposit system. Sometimes I can make a deposit in less than a minute, but often, it can take an hour to make a deposit because of glitches in their online deposit system, having to call to report a problem, and waiting to speak to someone.  Never are they able to explain why the problem is occuring or how to correct it, but indicate someone from tech support will need to call back.  Tech support never calls back.  Today, I made a deposit of one check with no problems and attempted to make a second deposit.  It went through seamlessly until the final step where the deposit is confirmed and gave me a message ""Oops, the deposit could not be made for the following reason.""  There was nothing stated as to the reason.  It instructed me to start over.  When I did and got to the confirmation, I got a message it could not be deposited because I had already made the deposit.  I called to see whether the deposit actually went through.  The Ally rep stated this cannot be confirmed for 2 working days.  Because today is Saturday, and Monday is a holiday, that means I won't get confirmation for 5 days, during which I will not know whether the deposit went through or not.  When I complained about the ongoing problems with the eDeposit system, I was told that eDeposit is a new service for Ally and that they are aware of many problems with the system but they are working out the details.  As I've been making deposits for a year, I don't consider this a new service, and finid it terrifying that in a year, they cannot get the system oprerational and that they began the system when it was not operational.",2013-05-25
1411,"Not Your ""Ally"" When It Comes To Service",13892,277,Ally Bank,13295,1,"I'm sorry to say that, after being a customer for over two years and singing Ally's praises to groups of friends and on social media, I'm leaving Ally Bank within the next two weeks. I had great service when they first launched, but recently I was attempting to get a larger sum of money out of my account (because I needed to put a deposit down on an apartment). After picking numerous touch tone options and speaking to three people, I was moved to Phil, a supervisor. <br/><br/>He was awful. Absolutely awful.<br/><br/>I was clearly upset and stressed, but Phil showed about the level of empathy as a desk fan. Rather than trying to talk through different options, Phil chose to repeat the same terms and service information over and over again. At no point did he apologize for the inconvenience or explain why my limit could not be raised. He just kept being exceptionally rigid and condescending. <br/><br/>Look, I get that there are fraud protections in place for cash withdrawals. I do, and I appreciate the concern. Yet, for some reason when I called back and spoke with Katelyn the story was completely different. All of a sudden there were options. We could go through the fraud department, but we could also wire the money, figure out a debit arrangement, set up a transfer to another bank for certified checks, among others. <br/><br/>To make matters worse, Phil then did what I can only assume is an act to get me off the phone, claiming that reception had been lost. Funny how reception is lost when I had full 4G bars and could actually here my echo in the Ally phone system (I make calls from the same location all day, every day - never a problem). I then heard him announce that the connection must have been lost and that he was hanging up, which then lead to the last straw - he didn't try to call me back. <br/><br/>If someone is upset and you lose a connection, the sign of great customer service is you calling someone back and not forcing them to go through the phone tree again. If Ally wants to treat me like a number, because they're growing, then that's fine, but don't claim to be my ""ally"" and all about service.<br/><br/>To summarize, the product is great and you do get good rates (relatively), but when it counts, Ally is awful. You should use another bank.",2013-05-25

Their checking accounts are simply great, since they have no fees, ATM rebates, high rates, and free checks and bill pay. I also like their savings account. Whenever I have needed customer service, I just called their phone number and was on the phone with someone usually in less than 5 minutes. They even post the wait time on their website.

I had a pervasive issue with my debit card PIN not functioning and getting rejected about once a month, but that has since been resolved through customer service.<br/><br/> 2. No remote check deposit in their android app. I figure it'll only be a matter of time, but for now it's detrimental when their customers primarily bank almost exclusively online.

I called Ally and spoke with Dustin Price who told me my son has to call to report identity theft. I explained he's in the Persian Gulf and couldn't they lock up the account until he can reach them. He literally laughed when I asked to speak with a supervisor when he told me there's nothing they can do. The supervisor, Jason Parker, said I ""might be the fraudster"" calling in to report the problem. I told him I wish they'd been this cautious when they opened this fraudulent account. And how many ""fraudsters"" call in to close accounts, know the address of record and the date of the letter they just sent out.

The rep asked what the issue that I needed a supervisor for and I told him what had happened from the beginning.  He explained everything they needed and I still don't understand what they need to  investigate. I would stay away from Ally Bank!",2012-11-20

Within a week, I finally received and deposited a check for over $4000. I received notice that Ally will not allow me to access my deposit for over 7 business days saying I have overdrawn on my account repeatedly. This is infuriating. This is a lie. I have overdrawn ONCE! it has been over a week since my deposit and I am STILL unable to access my money- MY money. I have called Customer Service and have been informed it is out of their control and it was the ""computers"" doing. Yes, they were serious. Customer service actually blames the computers.

1432,Give Them Your Money If You Want To Be Treated Like A Criminal,10616,277,Ally Bank,9591,1,"Absolutely, absolutely 0 stars if I could.<br/>Out of all my experiences dealing with banks and financial services, I can tell you that Ally bank is by far the worst experience I've ever had. Do NOT be deceived by their seemingly high interest rates and clever marketing of putting customers first. Nothing, and I mean nothing, is further from the truth. I opened a savings and checking account with them, and because of the high interest rate, I recommended my wife and dad to do the same.  A week later, my dad's account was locked without any notification. When my dad called, the customer service rep refused to tell him why they locked the account, and referred him to a ""fraud"" specialist.  The problem is, the ""fraud"" specialist could never be reached nor would this person return his voicemails.  A few days later, both my account and my wife's accounts get locked - again, without notification or warning of any kind.  To make matters worse, I made the mistake of already putting in my hard-earned savings - over 10K worth - into the Ally account. Now these money robbing ""allies"" basically locked out my money, all WITHOUT telling me why.  Again I called, and after waiting on the phone forever, was given the same run around as my dad - nobody can tell me why the account is locked, I need to talk to the fraud department, and of course, nobody from the department is available.  Left a voicemail and..surprise surprise, no callbacks. I'm still trying to reach them so I can get my money back!<br/><br/>Keep in mind we're just a regular hard working family with absolutely no credit problems or criminal backgrounds. I have investment relationship or accounts with most major banks, both physical and online, and was never treated this way.  I mean there were bouts of bad service, but nobody has ever denied me money that's literally mine. I've never felt so abused by a company in my lifetime. Do you know any other bank that will lock your account and freeze all your assets WITHOUT telling you? I feel like I'm some sort of a drug dealer, and the FBI is cracking down on me. It's one of the worst feelings ever. To top of all off, the customer service representatives on the phone were incredibly rude, and they like to transfer your call without telling you that they're doing so.  Literally, they told me ""I'm going to put you on hold,"" and the next second, I'm getting ""you have reached the loss prevention unit, please leave a message."" Absolutely infuriating when you're trying to recover money that's yours in the first place!  ""Loss prevention unit,"" why does a bank need this when I'm the one who's putting in the money while they're holding it hostage?  And I need to convince them I'm not some sort of the criminal so I can get the money out!!?<br/><br/>Again, do not ever, ever bank with this company. Don't be like me, do some searches online first and read all the complaints. A bank like this deserves to go under.",2012-09-07

Genuinely sick of their unknowledgeable customer service reps, I decided to run errands.  I went to a store and my card was DECLINED.  THAT got my attention, so I called them immediately and asked if someone had access to my card.  I was told that ""someone would get back to me within 48 hours"" about my card being potentially hacked!  Two days!  I asked that they call back at least the next day, and I was told they would ""put in that request for me.""<br/><br/>I just tried to access my online banking to monitor it for the possibility that someone was using my card, and MY ACCOUNT WAS BLOCKED from my access!

1438,Ridiculous Delay For An Internal Tranfer,9885,277,Ally Bank,661,1,"I have both CD's and an an online savings account at Ally. Due to low interest rates, I'm closing CD's as they mature and ""doing something else"" with the money. <br/> <br/> A few months ago, an Ally CD matured. Through secure email, I set things up in advance to have the CD closed and all funds deposited into my Ally online savings account upon maturity. The money was available either the maturation day, or the day after (I no longer remember). That's reasonable. I initiated a transfer to my own bank, and two or three days later the money was available to me. That's also reasonable. <br/> <br/>I now have another Ally CD about to mature. I've been told that ""due to security reasons"" they can no longer arrange for CD closures through secure email. That's a PITA, but okay, it just means I have to call them on the day it matures. <br/> <br/>What really burns my butt, though, is their new policy for internal transfer times: 3-6 days to close my Ally CD and transfer the money to my Ally online savings account. What?!?! That's a rip-off; considering the amount of the CD, that's about $40 in interest I'll lose waiting for them to transfer my money from one Ally account to another Ally account. Ally might as well send someone to my house, kick me in the ****, and steal $40 from my wallet while I'm lying on the ground. <br/> <br/>I'm now deciding if I should close all my CD's, in case Ally decides to change their 60-day early withdrawal fee language. Ally's change in internal transfer time doesn't bode well; I might be better off eating the 60-day fee, which I could expect to (though not guaranteed) make up with the ""something else"" I'm doing with my CD money.",2012-07-12

1440,Ally Bank - Internet Banking Not Ready For The Internet Or 21st Centiury,9531,277,Ally Bank,8264,1," <br/><br/> I just recently opened up an account with Ally Bank. Everything went smooth on opening up the account and transferring money from my regular bank. I also did the same with ING Direct. I wanted to open up 2 small accounts and see which bank had the best experience to deal with before I transferred larger amounts. I had three criterias that I wanted to test, easy of transferring money between accounts, customer service, and mobiile banking solutions (Rates are important but let's be honest they all suck so other criterias are more important in todays financial markets). Ally won the first two criterias. Ally transferred the money faster, Ally has outsanding customer service. A real customer service person was a real nice surprise. However, their Mobile banking solution is horrible and is just not acceptable.<br/><br/> I have an Android Tablet and found out that Ally's Mobile Banking Android application does not work on Android tablets (only Phones) and was told by their tech support that the app will not work on android tablets until the end of 2012. This is unacceptable for an internet banking company. As they say or ESPN ""C'mon Man"", you got to be kidding!!!! It only shows me that they are not capable of competing in this market and one would have to question investing one's money in a bank that is not ready for ""Prime Time"" in the Mobile App Market. They may have a  slightly better rate than ING but ING seems to have their act together with their internet and mobile solutions. It just makes me more trusting in ING at this time. I am bitterly disappointed in Ally that they are taking so long in coming up with a mobile solution. If I was CEO of Ally I would appoint a team to get this accomplished immediately --- no excusses accepted!!!!<br/><br/> I do not understand how they can get such glowing reviews when their Mobile Banking Solution is so terrible. And I am trying to be kind here. It is just awful and Ally Management better take steps to bring them into today's mobile banking environment or they will be out of business soon!!!!<br/><br/> If Mobile Banking capabilities is important to you I would stay away untile they get their act together!!!<br/><br/> Disappointed new customer and transferring funds to ING or some other Bank who understands Mobile Banking solutions.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  ",2012-06-13

The rep told me that the transfer would occur in 1 - 2 business days. I checked four days later and the transfer had not been done. I called and they said there had been ""confusion"" cc: the transfer so they performed the transfer while I was on the phone. I thought the whole thing strange but everything was handled to my satisfaction.<br/><br/> Then a week a later the same thing occurred with another CD that matured where I was told the transfer would take 1 - 2 days. When it did not occur I followed up and the response was that they were busy and it could take 5 - 7 days to complete the internal transfer of the CD to savings (both at Ally). I objected to this so again they did the transfer while I waited on the phone. I appreciate the fact they were honest with the reason but ""being too busy"" is a very bizarre answer.<br/><br/> I have had CDs with two other online banks and the redeeming could be done on-line. With Ally requiring a personal contact to do this plus this hassle of actually getting a transfer done plus Ally's very low rates I would not recommend getting a CD with them.

1456,A Cautionary Tale: Why Moving My Accounts To Ally Bank Was A HUGE Mistake.,8139,277,Ally Bank,6459,1,"Here's why leaving my local bank and transferring my account to Ally Bank was a HUGE mistake.  I was scheduled to close on my home refinance this past Friday, and on Thursday I was told how much I needed to bring to closing and to get a cashier's check or money order.  I tried to get a money order or cashier's check with my Ally debit card but was declined at three stores because my daily debit card limit was $500.  I called Ally Bank three times, spoke with four representatives, and all said there was nothing they could do and to wait until Tuesday or Wednesday of next week to find out if I'm ""approved"" to raise my debit card limit.  Really?  I told them over and over I needed my money in hours, not days.  Then they said to use my debit card ""as a credit card"" or ""point of sale transaction"" at Walmart.  I went to Wal-Mart and was laughed at when I explained to them what Ally Bank told me I could do.  Apparently their cash registers specificly disallow this kind of transaction.  I wasted my entire Friday trying to get a cashier's check or money order with my Ally Bank debit card and was completely unsuccessful.  I can't believe there's not someone in the entire Ally Bank organization at any given time that can immediately approve a short-term increase in my debit card limit.  Needless to say, my refinance closing didn't happen and the earliest I might be able to close again is next week, but guess what ... my interest rate lock will expire before then. Ally Bank has effectively forced me to surrender my locked financing terms.  If I hadn't left my local bank, I could have just walked in, got a cashier's check and been done.  Just as I told all four Ally Bank representatives on Friday, if I can't get access to my money by the time I was scheduled to close, I will close all my accounts and withdraw all my funds on the first business day I can, and that's exactly what I plan to do now.  This is a cautionary tale for those of you who may be considering the ""internet bank"" approach to banking.  No matter how convenient or customer-friendly an internet bank like Ally will try to present themselves as, there are simply limitations that apparently not even Ally Bank themselves can overcome to ensure their customers are getting the same level of service they can get at a traditional brick-and-mortar bank.",2012-02-19

Well that was a week ago. I am a programmer and know that problem would not take long to fix. Also, their chat disconnected me multiple times. There are so many problems already, I do not want to take a risk that next time the problem will be with my money disappearing. I just pray that all my money will make it out of Ally intact. I will never bank with them again.",2012-02-16
1458,Closed Ally Accounts,8022,277,Ally Bank,6321,1,Closed Ally accounts after they put a fraud freeze on my accounts and would not tell me what was going on even after going through all the verification and wanted me to wait till the next day to talk to someone in fraud department. Finally that evening I got to a supervisor who  revealed only the joint account was blocked because the other signer had reported correspondence came from Ally unsealed by their mailing service.  They never told the other signer they were blocking that account.   It's not acceptable to deny access to liquid funds without notifying the account owner and explaining what to do about the freeze.,2012-02-09
1459,Best Bank I've Ever Had!,8008,277,Ally Bank,6314,4,"0 fees at all. Super good customer service 24/7. You can chat, email and call them any day any time. Unlimited atm refunds.

They even offer free antimalware protection for their customers coputers (all your computers) They have the Ally perks, a great savings tool by using your debit card with participating retailers instore or online. Ally bank, just makes a lot of sense! I definitely recommend this bank. The only thing that keeps them from getting a perfect score is that they have not develop an android, Iphone , tablet app yet. But, Ally already stated that they are working on it. 4 stars out of five for Ally bank.",2012-02-08
1460,No Problems,7958,277,Ally Bank,661,4,"Most of the online banks are interchangeable. Although the Fed rates have remained stable (close to zero), the online bank rates have dropped. Still, it's better to earn 0.84% or 0.9% than nothing, which is what brick-and-mortar banks pay, especially commercial banks. <br/> <br/>I've found Ally to be just as solid as ING (which my sister uses) and Emigrantdirect (which I stopped using when their interest rate plummeted.) <br/> <br/>On quibble: They post the monthly interest payments on the 5th of the month rather than the 1st. But they're consistent about it. <br/> <br/>Another quibble: They're no longer the highest-paying online bank, but not by much.",2012-02-05
1461,Credit Report Requirement For Any New Account Opening,7892,277,Ally Bank,661,1,"Ally insists on running a credit report for ANY new account opening, even for existing customers with other active accounts with them. <br/> <br/>This is an unnecessary requirement from both the FDIC and federal reserve, and a hard cost to justify for those of us with a credit freeze in place. I'm not spending $5 every time i need a savings or a new CD account opened. No other bank I've done business with has had this requirement for existing customers.",2012-01-30
1462,Denied A Savings Account,7811,277,Ally Bank,661,1,"I tried to open a savings account with Ally because I thought an online account would be a good way to start to create a little financial security after my recent bankruptcy. Ally denied my attempt because of the bankruptcy. <br/> <br/>After maintaining an exceptional credit history for 30 years, my divorce put me in a position where I could no longer manage my debt. I still have a mortgage and car loan that are paid on time every month. I'm not sure how Ally thought I would be irresponsible with a savings account... but that's fine, ING Direct didn't seem to have a problem with it, so that's where my savings will grow!",2012-01-24
1463,Surprise Fee,7478,277,Ally Bank,5623,1,"I've been with Ally for some time now, but I'm dropping them because 1, they decided to hold a deposit for an extended period without telling me; 2, bounced a check because of that; 3, charged me a fee; 4, refused to refund that fee. And get this: I had plenty of money in the account to cover the check even without that deposit!<br/><br/> This is on top of the many errors they have made over the last year (which all got corrected, eventually). I overlooked them, because I knew that Ally had just set up their web site and an entirely new system, and were still working out the bugs. But this is just too much. What good is a relatively high interest rate on deposits (still well below 1%) if they can steal an undeserved ""fee"" equal to six months interest any time they feel like it?<br/><br/> I've had it with Ally. I'm closing my accounts and won't be back.",2011-12-27
1464,Don't Use Their Overdraft Protection!,7422,277,Ally Bank,5568,1,"Ally has overdraft protection, which will automatically transfer funds from your savings to your checking. While it does protect against bouncing a check or having a transaction declined, Ally flags this as a negative mark on your account. This will lead to your deposits being held for ""extended periods"", sometimes up to 12 days! Also, they do NOT communicate this you, even though their Deposit Agreement says they will.",2011-12-22
1465,Damn Good Bank!,7135,277,Ally Bank,5251,4,"Not entirely sure about the majority of these reviews over a year ago, but I opened an Interest Chacking accoung and a Money Market account over the summer and could not be happier (Note: coming from BOA). The only gripe that I have with Ally so far is that I try to check my account balance on occasion and sometimes (3-4 times since June this year) the website is down. Typically this is resolved, at worst, by the next day. While annoying, it's not been a huge deal for me just yet as I use credit cards for all of my purchases anyway. One other thing, I really wish they had a smart phone app. I would appreciate being able to at least check my balances on my phone and would appreciate being able to deposit checks through my phone even more. Other than those two concerns, I love this bank.",2011-11-30
1466,Online Echeck Deposit,7063,277,Ally Bank,661,1,"I have a CD, savings, and decided to open a checking account with Ally because of the echeck deposit service they offer. I tried to make a deposit using their echeck service into my checking account, but couldn't do it. I disabled pop up block like they told me, I turned off the firewall and antivirus, called them, chatted online with 2 reps and was still not able to make the deposit. I am wondering if somebody is able to use their echeck deposit. The only reason why I opened a checking account with them was because I was going to be able to deposit it online instead of mailing it.",2011-11-21
1467,Rates Are Decent But Beware Of Their Poor Internal Accounting,7017,277,Ally Bank,5067,2,"I have 3 CDs and a savings account at Ally. I've had no issues with the CDs to date and was given a great rate with a low early withdrawal penalty should I one day need access to the funds. I also have a savings account with them that I used to like and use regularly, but currently I only have $1 sitting in it. The reason for that is that several months ago when randomly logging in to check my balance, low and behold, my account mysteriously was showing a NEGATIVE value of nearly $49,000! When I called Ally to figure out what was going on, the rep had no idea how a negative balance could even be possible (nor did I!). After much wrangling and cursing with a manager, a few days later Ally finally determined that they had made an internal error and had mistakenly deducted $50,000 from my account that should have been deducted from some other customer's account that had a similar account number. I respect the fact that Ally did ultimately resolve the issue properly and they did provide a written letter apologizing for the error. However, one would think their system would be properly designed to catch when a deduction is taking an account $49,000 into the HOLE. That I simply can't live with. I'm happy to let them keep my CDs since (I hope) they can't screw those up, but I have no desire to use the savings account anymore after such a debacle... trust is difficult to restore once broken.",2011-11-17

1475,Watch Out! Double Check Their Math!,4538,277,Ally Bank,2577,1,"I recently did an early closure of two CDs at Ally Bank. Before I closed them I was able to look at the accounts online and see how much I was supposed to receive for an early closure (principal plus interest minus penalty).<br/><br/> Much to my surprise, after I closed them I got a LOWER amount deposited into my checking account. It was about 1% off of where it should have been, which is actually less than the amount I had originally deposited in the CDs!! (They hadn't been open long)<br/><br/> I emailed them to complain and in a day or two they reversed that deposit and then deposited MORE money into my checking than I thought I was due. There was never any explanation given for how they came up with this amount, how they had come up with the previous amount, or how the error had happened in the first place. Nor did they apologize for screwing up.<br/><br/> I have used Ally for several years but this is the last straw. I just do not trust them anymore.

1481,Great Bank (3152),3152,277,Ally Bank,1674,5,This bank is the best bank out there.  They don't have any physical locations but other than that.. its great.  The customer service is available 24/7 and their website is easy to navigate.  They offer free accounts when every other bank is charing you fees or making you do certain things to keep the account free.  <br/><br/> Everyone should look at their bank and the interest they are being paid.  I know that ally has rates that went down over the past few months but so has every other bank.  Can't blame them for a downed economy.<br/><br/> I've tried every product and i'm happy.  the 11month no fee cd is great!  ,2010-12-02
1482,Ally Problems To Be Aware Of,2996,277,Ally Bank,661,3,"First there is a problem with their bill pay system. The system does not verify account numbers of electronic payees. One of their CSR said the account would be verified when a payment was made.  Well it's a little late if the payment wont go through.  Wonder if Ally would pay the late fees? Ally is aware of this problem.<br/><br/> Second their ""New"" service provider for external transfers seems to have issues.  I had linked an external bank account with my Ally account back in 2007.  When they changed to CashEdge for a provider suddenly the name of this bank was changed.  It was changed to the name of the bank in 2004.  Although the account and routing number seemed to be correct I'm not sure I can trust Cash Edge.<br/><br/> I hate to see Ally messing things up like this. They have been good to work with in the past.<br/><br/> Oh berore these problems I would have given them 5 stars.",2010-11-12

It really makes my life easier knowing I do not have to worry about going out of my way to find certain ATMs that won't charge me a fee. Derek, College Student",2010-11-08

Service with Ally has been spotty over the course of the 6 months I've had them. One recent example was a double transfer of funds that happened between my Chase account and Ally. I had initiated a transfer of $500. Ally inexplicably transferred an additional $500. I called and was told that the glitch was caused by the installation of new system software. It has taken a week to resolve. Much of it having to do with lack of communications between the people in the back-end operations and the customer service reps. (even supervisor level). I wish they would get their act together because I really like the concept of a virtual bank, and not being charged for ATM use.",2010-10-29

1486,Love Ally's Cds! Talk About A Generous Withdrawal Fee.,2762,277,Ally Bank,1463,5,"I went with Ally bank about 1 year ago. The reason why is because of the awesome 5 year cd rates and the fact that the CD withdrawal penalty is only 2 months interest.<br/><br/> So, do the math. If you can get a 5 year cd rate for even 14 months and then withdraw and get penalized 2 months interest, that is still one full year at a 5 year cd rate.<br/><br/> I also have really like their customer service, website, branding, and consistency. <br/><br/> Hooray for Ally bank!",2010-10-16

1490,HORRIBLE!!!!,2143,277,Ally Bank,1078,1,"After setting up an acct with ally,  I then initiated a fund transfer to ally (using ally's online system). I called ally beforehand to make sure it would be ok since the 30 day time frame to deposit was approaching. I was ASSURED that as long as I initiated the transfer before 30 days, it was fine. I waited patiently for several days but received nothing from ally.. no e-mail, no phone call. I signed onto my ally acct. and now my balance showed a NEGATIVE dollar amount instead of zero. When I called them, they said my acct had been closed because I didn't deposit money in time! BUT.. they had taken my money from my other bank! Incredulously though, they said at the same time that since the acct. was closed that they DIDN'T really have my money! My ""old"" bank confirmed the monies had been sent to ally. MORE calls to ally.. they have NO idea where my money is or how to get it back! I go into my ""old"" bank and they actually spend a LOT of time helping me figure it out although they had NOTHING to do with the problem. With the information (ACH tracking numbers that ally wouldn't bother looking for) from my ""old"" bank, I call ally AGAIN ( I don't even know how many times I called ally). This time (after mentioning perhaps banking authorities might be notified) they miraculously are able to find the money! I am STILL waiting for the money to be returned to my ""old"" bank. Funny.. their claim to fame.. being an ultra modern, high-speed, web-based bank.. sure seems like BS when you consider it has been over TWO WEEKS and I STILL don't have my money back and they weren't able to find, track, or identify ANYTHING! I had to go into an old-school, brick and mortar bank and have a REAL PERSON help me! So, an online bank may give you a little interest and allow you to use ATMs nationwide, but JUST WAIT until something goes wrong! THEN you will wish you had a REAL PERSON to help you!

1491,Ally Bank Is My Primary Institution Because I Hate Fees,2028,277,Ally Bank,821,5,"I've been an Ally Bank money market checking/online savings/CD customer for a few years (longer than any other institution since rates have been declining).  They have always been in the top 5% of those paying the most interest.  Although I have moved money away from them for short periods when other banks offer more, their consistency has brought me back when the special rates vanished.<br/><br/> When a CD matured recently, I called and asked them to transfer it to my Ally Bank savings account, as I planned to use the money in the next few weeks.  The customer service rep offered up their no penalty CD, which paid more than their checking or savings.  It could be closed after 6 days with just a call, so I said okay (after looking at ALL the details on their website).  They also offered a .25% interest rate bonus to keep the CD with them.  When I called to close it a few weeks later, they were more than accommodating, and it was moved to my checking account promptly.<br/><br/> I also like the fact that they give you a rebate for all ATM charges at the end of each month, and there are no fees for their checks or for maintaining your account.  The only thing I have to watch out for is the 6 withdrawals per month limitation, which is not problem for me (ATM withdrawals are unlimited).",2010-07-11

If you go with 5 year CD, the interest rate is now 2.95%.<br/><br/> The account opening process is very easy. You will receive a letter of confirmation about your CD term and rate. They should be able to reserve your rate for 10 days. Please pay attention and make sure it is the rate when you opened the account. The Ally Bank CD rate changed after I opened the account, I got the new rate instead of the one when I opened. I called the CSR and they were able to confirm my CD opening date and give me back the correct rate. <br/><br/> Even though there was a little hick up, the overall customer service is good.

1493,I Agree Totally With #4,1005,277,Ally Bank,661,1,"I agree totally with #4’s assessment of Ally. I’m extremely disappointed in their continual conflicting and erroneous information … their failure to carry out my written instructions … their slowness to respond until deadlines have passed -- mistakes which always help their bottom line and hurt mine. It’s happened so many times that it’s difficult to believe it is simply incompetence … rather than deliberate orchestration.<br/><br/>Here’s an example. Last summer I opened a number of accounts which I planned to fund by having my broker wire the money to Ally. One day around 2:30 I called Ally and asked for their wiring information … telling them my broker had a 3:00 deadline in order to get the money to Ally that day.<br/><br/>The rep advised me that I shouldn’t wire the money … that ACH transfers were faster … even though I had not set up any ACH links! It took me a while to convince her otherwise, and get her to agree to give me the wire instructions. I asked her to please hurry because of the 3:00 deadline. Again it took her quite a while; she put me on hold several times. I had a strong sense that something was “off” but assumed it was honest incompetence.<br/><br/>A few minutes before 3:00 she finally gave me the wire instructions. I rushed to my broker’s website but missed the deadline. No big deal, I thought … the money will be there tomorrow … what’s one day.<br/><br/>You’ve probably guessed the ending -- Ally had known they were making significant rate drops the next day for all of my accounts. The amount I invested was in the six figures … so the loss in earnings was significant. I’ve never been naïve about Ally’s seeming incompetence and slowness since.<br/><br/>I don’t phone them … I get everything in writing … I print all live chats before they disappear … I print all emails in my Ally mailbox lest they disappear. It’s slow and tedious -- and still full of errors. At this moment there are three “mistakes” I’m trying to iron out. Naturally I’m considering leaving.<br/><br/>Ally is the LEAST “straightforward” bank I have dealt with in my very long life.",2010-03-18

I called for support at 2:30 my time, but as I am on the west coast, GBC was already closed FOR THE WEEKEND! I went to the GBC website - no tech support number! At this point i really started questioning why I opened a CD at this bank. I was actually a little worried. I deal with at least 12 banks at any given time (it's a hobby) and I've never run into this lack of online customer service. What if I'd had a checking or savings account and absolutely needed to do a transfer?<br/>After calling at opening time Monday morning, their message stating they were closed was running until 10 minutes past their opening time. Finally got through to Brenda D. The only bright spot in the whole experience. She was empathetic and really understood the problem.

1496,Appreciation For Honor In Dating CD For Higher Rate,37413,11959,Georgia Banking Company,3110,5,"Aug 12, despite what robot displays.<br/><br/>This is a note of appreciation for the ethical integrity of the bankers at GBC. I had 100K cash that I was planning to put into a 2-year CD sometime in mid-August. But as everyone will recall, the stock market was crashing on Monday/Tuesday Aug 5-6, and the flight to safety caused bond rates and CD rates to drop like a rock. GBC had the best rate for 2-year CD, at 2.80% APY on Monday. I already had a CD there from 3 months ago, and a money market account. See my comment from May 23. So on Monday 8/05 I phoned them. CSR said yes, I could send them the 100K by ACH to the MM acct and they would set up the CD; that way there would be no delay for online application, verification, etc. I immediately sent the 100K, and saw that it had arrived in the MM acct on Tuesday. The CD rate was still 2.80% APY. But on Wed my new CD still had not shown up on their website, and their rate on the CD had now dropped to 2.60% APY. Yikes! And on Thursday still no CD showing up on the website. I was worried they might be delaying issuing the CD in order to give me the new lower rate. But no, they are simply slow in doing paperwork and updating their website -- maybe too much work for too small crew. In the end I got the 2.80% APY, dated for Tuesday 8/06 as promised. This is a bank whose officers still maintain the good old-fashioned Southern honor and ethics. I'll not be sending them any more money, maybe for 2 years, because it's already deployed elsewhere. But I just wanted to give praise where praise is definitely due. And by the way, they now have a toll-free phone number after I complained 3 months ago on this blog; so they do listen and make improvements.",2019-05-23

1507,Their Bonus Offer For New Accounting Opening Is Very TRICKY!,38559,51,Wells Fargo Bank,61954,1,"Be Really Cautious of Their Bonus Offer for New Accounting Opening<br/>For those of you who are interested in their promotional bonus offer for new account openings, especially the $400 bonus one, there are a few things you REALLY need to keep in mind: <br/>1. Never ever open an account online if you want to receive a bonus. Online account opening is easy, but it may also be a ""trap"" for the bank not depositing you the bonus. You need a BONUS CODE during account opening. This code will not show up if you open online even though the ad says it will be automatically applied, but the bank would not acknowledge this. I opened the account through their ads online, it clearly said that their ""bonus code will be automatically applied"". However, I fulfilled all the requirements and waited for two months, they said they did not have my BONUS CODE. Are you kidding me? I went to their branches several times and presented the online promo page to them, they still could not figure things out for me. This made me feel like I was fooled by Wells Fargo and their promotional emails! $400 is not a big deal, but nobody likes the feeling of being fooled by others and doesn't know what's going on!<br/>2. Make sure you read all the terms and conditions, including the vast majority terms underneath their ads with much smaller characters. This is a common trick that most companies do. If you do not understand any of these terms or you do not know how to do, just don't proceed. You do not want to waste your time and end up getting nothing! <br/>3.Make sure you have all the evidence with you when opening your account. They do not have the incentive to pay you any amount. You should do your job if some things happen!<br/><br/>In General, all so-called promotional offers are tactic tricks. Be really cautious of those things and stay away from them if you do not 100% know them!",2019-08-22

1511,Wells Fargo Worst Bank You Can Sign Up With.,34965,51,Wells Fargo Bank,52994,1,"I had been a customer when the bank before they merged was called first Union and they were great.<br/>Then they merged with Wachovia and they started to mess up a little with hidden fees and weird charges but I could always call and fix things and it was not as bad as now. Wachovia Merged with Wells Fargo and then everything you can possibly think could go wrong did.I had a checking and a savings and I opened the account for my disabled son a checking account in 1997 I opened all accounts but with the above banks. We started to see all kinds of things repeated and charge over and over again in my accounts I cleared it out and then, again and again, the charges. I closed down my accounts. From checks that were not even directed to me with totally different names in my account to charges that had not been paid and I had the money as I got paid weekly from my job through direct deposit. Even though the accounts did not get paid it showed up that they did in my bank statements that they did. I took all evidence to the bank and to the people I owe money and they people kept saying that they did not get in showing me their bank statements. When I went over there they pulled a who on first base and what on second base from the three Stuges Comedy scene to confuse me when I try to <br/>explain then they ruined my credit and it lasted for years finally when I get my credit back in shape now they are doing the same thing to my son who is disabled and he does not do his trasactions I do. Now my poor son who only mistake was to order online to a company called KIngSize he ordered before never had a problem but this time he did he got instead of a Cap which was a very fine and expensive item but it was in sale just for 59.99 and he took advantage of the sale and then instead of that they sent him a underwear that was 3 sizes to small so he could not even use it.He made me call to get the money back and shortly they did but when we sent the package back as they ordered they delivered that package back in August the 29th so I did not know that happened until it showed up on his bank account and we did not even have the package back yet as we had sent it in July the 12th.Then we call and they said that we probably sent it to the address where they send out product with returns its differently so we asked what can we do as we had tried in their website to activate a Postage but it was not there it was blank so they activated the postage and we sent it back they got their product and gave us our money back in 08/31/2018 when we looked in his account it was not there. They had a temporary charge and they left in the online website that we needed to present evidence or we were liable for the charges so I called and then they said we needed evidence so they can conduct an investigation. They got their evidence to reject it and later state that they gave me the money until the account was paid and when it did that they had paid two times so they went and charged my poor son 59.99 again. I call them they pull off the same comedy scene again whos on the third act. To confuse people they can never confuse me as I am very good at math. According to my math, he has money left over but you can't win with them. They will cheat you and say it's your fault and you can bring them evidence and they still will blame you for their mistakes. My question is when they make a temporary deposit and they are awaiting the company to deposit the money back they get it why would they charge the client the money when it was paid back by the company this case King Size Men clothing. Then they place in his account as if he got paid twice and he did not he got paid once it was removed due to issues of returned product and when finally they got the product they paid the provisional money and how is that even legal that they charge the client that had no fault in this but the banks and the merchants mistake. As you see there is no double payment but a return in funds and the client is not responsible for the charge.I want to sue this is just one of the few problems we have been having with this bank.",2018-09-08

I will say I like how Wells Fargo is organized both at the teller window and also in online banking. I do like visiting our local branch, and all employees are pleasant people. I am glad to say I did not encounter any problems during the fake account scandals. That was probably due to good managers at our local branch who didn't get greedy. But they have been given a weak hand to play with from upper management. The savings rates are abysmal. I remember when I had 4 or 5 percent before the crash of 2008. .01 percent is just not competitive, and I am finding myself throwing more money into online institutions to get some more money for my money. I can understand they have a lot more overhead than the online guys, but some sort of rate hike would be nice. We've been stuck at .01 for nearly ten years?

Both the pc and android interfaces are well laid out and easy to use. They have the option for several different kinds of notifications -- when a deposit is cleared, when balance goes below a certain amount, when a payment is due -- which greatly increases my confidence and comfort in moving away from paper statements (which I no longer use).<br/> <br/>I have checking and savings account with WF, and one complaint there is that interest rates on checking are now virtually nil (but that's true of most banks anymore). My only other complaint is that, apparently, when I set up my account many years ago in a different state, I set up some sort of PIN number that would enable me to interact with WF customer service on the phone. I did not keep track of that PIN, and when attempting to speak with customer service, they tell me the only way I can deal with the issue is to go into the original WF branch where I set up my account. Given the fact that branch is about 800 miles away, this is not feasible, so I simply have to do without phone interaction with WF. This hasn't really been a problem, but I find it annoying. Surely I could provide them with sufficient information over the phone to establish my identity and set up a new PIN? Apparently not.<br/> <br/>Complaints aside though, if you are looking a bank, I would recommend Wells Fargo.

They also checked credentials to ensure account security which I liked. They also offered user feedback after instances that I called which seemed invaluable to me. The experience itself of checking online status of accounts was relatively painless and smooth. There were really no outages and the service seemed robust and secure on a secure website. Since I didn't purchase an products I can't really relate as I know the offered some services like mortgage which I wasn't interested in. Lastly, the fees were below average.

In other words for years I had been getting slightly ripped off by this bank who was commanded by the CEOs to enforce the shady fees, but at the end of the day the people that were blamed and fired were the middlemen.

I go to the bank and talk to a banker and he tells me that I won't get an overdraft fee So I assume I will slowly put money into that account til after the first of the year when I will pay it off. The account has been negative from Nov 30th to Dec 20th not even a whole month. So Wells Fargo waits 5 days before Christmas and takes the money from one account and puts it in the negative account which zeroed out my account without the curteousy of letting me know before they did it. I have been with this bank for 14 years and that's how they treat their customers. I am going to close this account and I would advise anyone looking for a bank to look elsewhere. I have had troubles over the years but it was small mistakes like charging me overdraft fees for mistakes the bank had made on those occasions the bank always gave me the overdraft fees back but it was the inconvenience of those small things. Not a very good bank at all. Remember I have been with this bank for 14 years so I have a valid leg to stand on with this review. There are lots of other banks and I will be closing both of my accounts and I will be urging everyone I know to do the same.,2017-12-20

Being able to do all of this online, has taken a lot of the unpleasantness out of banking. Overall, I love Wells Fargo's online banking, and it keeps me their customer, even though the bank does have some policies I disagree with (like transaction fees for non-Wells Fargo ATMS, in addition to w/e fee the machine already has).

Another thing that is nice is you can see actually what you money you have spent from each account and what money may being deposited in soon or already is so you always have up to date information on how much money you really have.,2017-10-27
1530,Happy Customer,29641,51,Wells Fargo Bank,43323,5,"I have had nothing but a great experience with Wells Fargo. I have had a checking account and a savings account since I got my first job when I was 15. Eight years later, they are still the only bank I use and will continue to use for the foreseeable future. Their benefits are great and they have given me many tips throughout the years on how to manage and save my money, as well as help pay off other accounts to the best of my ability. Any time I have ever had an issue, their customer service was very knowledgeable and able to quickly assist me. The best example was when my credit card had suspicious activity on it; they quickly froze the card and sent me a brand new one in a couple of days. My entire family uses Wells Fargo for their banking needs and I would recommend them for anyone looking to open a banking account.",2017-09-30
1531,Not so Wells Fargo,29579,51,Wells Fargo Bank,43193,2,"I absolutely did not like my experience with Wells Fargo. This was the first bank I opened an account with when I became of age. I thought I was in love at the time and opened a shared account with my partner. I was supposed to have total control of the accounts, including hers. Well, things went bad between us and she had went and taken all the money out of my account and spent it. I went into the bank and told them I wanted her off and asked them how she had gotten into my account. They couldn't give me one answer. Apparently she manipulated someone there to give her access to one of my accounts with them. I got the paper to sign to get her off of my account and she refused to sign it for a while. I called and told them to take her off or I would contact their manager about the person that let her gain access to my account and they finally took her off because I was not very happy.",2017-09-26
1532,Great Banking,29576,51,Wells Fargo Bank,43190,4,I like Wells Fargo. I think its a great institution that takes care of its costumers. I opened a savings account a couple of months ago because I was quite unpleasant with my other bank. I was happy that I made this choice because so far the service has been great and I feel appreciated as a customer. I think that its important for a bank to leave its customers in a positive note and this is what Wells Fargo does for me. I like the movie experience and also that the process to make transactions is quite easy. Overall I would say that my experience is a 4 out of 5 star one. I think this institution can improve in some ways but so far I'm glad and think that I will remain loyal to this bank for a long time. I think this banking institution is doing things right and that is what matters the most at the end of the day.,2017-09-26

The staff is always nice and friendly, sometimes too much so willing to help you and call you the following day to make sure youre satisfied. The service is always fast and you bnever wait long. There are ATMS everywhere which is nice. The mobile app is great for checking statements and balances and sending payments with wells fargo surepay is super easy and fast. But they also want to sell you as many services as possible, so be on guard. If you have followed the news lately you will know they have been in trouble before, first for CEO bonuses even after receiving federal bailout money, and the other times for manipulating customers accounts without their knowledge to purchase more services and increase sales. This was the latest one that got 2 CEOs fired and their salaries/bonuses ""clawed back"".",2017-08-24

When we got married we merged our accounts into his wells fargo checking account. The people in the branch were friendly, efficient, and helpful, and it was a very easy process. Wells fargo is a trusted company and i feel good about banking with them. They really know what they are doing. Their mobile and web presence is also good. I love the app and do all of my banking from there. It is user friendly and i love that i can deposit checks by photo and i dont have to drive to the bank. it is very convenient. I dont think i will be switching any time soon.",2017-08-12

Their mortgage was easy to pay using a transfer from my checking account onto the mortgage balance. There checking account does have maintenance fees which is a negative, but they can be waived it you reach certain requirements within your checking account each month such as debit card transactions or direct deposit. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a local bank.",2017-08-07
1536,Satisified Wells Fargo Customer.,28729,51,Wells Fargo Bank,41286,4,"I have been a Wells Fargo customer for over 10 years and basically do all my banking on line. Their website is easy to get into, looks sharp and is usable through all my devices. I pay all my bills through the app and website. It lists all my debtors and keeps track of my payments so I don't miss one. It is also easy to transfer money between your own accounts and you can even transfer money to other peoples accounts like my son who also uses Wells Fargo. I had an identity theft issue a few years back and Wells Fargo put the money back into my account the next business day, basically no questions asked other than the standard ones. My statements are easily accessable and easy to read. I also especially like the feature when you can take a picture of a check with your phone and the money is deposited into my account without having to go to the back. Its all about convenience with the Wells Fargo app and website.",2017-08-06

1538,Wells Fargo is my Last Choice,28708,51,Wells Fargo Bank,41261,2,"If I had known how bad the user experience for Wells Fargo was so bad, I would never have banked with them. Their fee schedule is random at best, their customer service both online and on the phone, almost always refers one back to ""We can't help, the end,"" and their website is one of the most basic I have ever encountered. The site is, however, harder to navigate than most sites, and does not appear to have been updated in several years. Several parts of the site, such as routing numbers, are unnecessarily obfuscated, and all of their site information is hidden in tiny links at the very bottom, if you're lucky. Having used Wells Fargo for a good four years now, I can pretty definitively say that theirs is one of the worst websites I've used, for a bank or otherwise.",2017-08-04
1539,Unfair Overdrafts,28704,51,Wells Fargo Bank,41257,1,"I banked with Wells Fargo for awhile starting when I was a teenager. I became disillusioned with them over their overdraft policies and subsequently switched to Chase. Overall I would not recommend this bank to another person. They also have dubious policies regarding their credit cards that they issue to people that I had problems with as well. I would not go back to this bank. I do like their logo however, that's about all I can say for them. I heavily caution anyone against using this bank as I do not favor them anymore and will not be going back to them ever. They also affected my credit score negatively which is not good. I'm still trying to fix issues they caused for me.",2017-08-03

I opened a regular checking and Way-2-Save savings account. Although the Way-2-Save feature of the account is no longer offered, I still find their services quite engaging and forward thinking. The Way-2-Save feature allowed $1 from every transaction I made to be automatically put into my savings account without needing to manually set up an auto transfer online. The online banking experience has been easy and very rewarding as well. I really hate going inside banks to make transactions and find pleasure and satisfaction in knowing I can get all the services I need done on a user-friendly online interface. I can easily pay bills, set up transfers, wire money, interact with my accounts and even plan for my retirement!

I deposited a cash amount of one thousand dollars, I forgot to get my receipt. i went to buy something and there was no money in my account. I quickly went to the bank and it took five days to get my deposit situated. and I had to go with out my money or any money until they resolved the issue. On top of that , I had to wait an additional seven to ten days to get my money back into my account. I closed my account and will never go there again.

This is where my company deposits their pay to me, my businesses too and other form of transactions so it's a hassle for me if I have to go to the bank physically and update my account for any deposits made. All I have to do is log on to their website and have my account summary just like that, it's very convenient and easy to use. I also have tried contacting there customer service for some questions regarding my account and they replied quickly on that same day, it took them at least 4 hours to respond to me but that's okay, that's a lot better than physically going to there banks.",2017-07-12

I was able to contact them through WellsFargo.com and in less then 10 minutes I had my $20 refunded to my checking account. Their ATM machines now accept Apple Pay so I don't ever have to take my card out of my wallet, all I need to do now is use my phone and I am in and out with my cash in about half the time it use to take me.

Since then I have kept my savings and checking accounts in Wells Fargo because they have offered me basically the same services as Wachovia. The customer support has improved quite a bit over the course of the past few years. Every encounter I've had with the staff of Wells Fargo has been quite pleasant and reasonable. The website was just recently overhauled and it has a much more aesthetically pleasing graphical user interface then it had before. It also has more features that are useful for a user who is managing his or her Checking and Savings accounts. The growth rates on these accounts are competitive with many other major banks but they aren't anything above the average which is fine for me. Also, the fees involved in Wells Fargo are usually pretty fair and average. I've never encountered a strange or out of place fee and most of the fees that I've had to deal with can be negotiated with the customer service of this bank. Overall, Id say that Wells Fargo is a decent bank for checking and savings accounts.",2017-02-27
1546,Nashville 4Th Avenue Branch Won't Give Me Cash From My Own Checking Account,26866,51,Wells Fargo Bank,37188,1,"On Friday, February 17, 2017 I took my Wells Fargo checkbook to Wells Fargo to cash a check for $100. Imagine my surprise when a poorly trained teller, whom I later learned was from Somalia and had never learned that the checking account number for a customer is on the check, asked me three times if I had an account at Wells Fargo, which I explained was on the check. Despite making the check out to myself, signing the check, and endorsing it all in his presence, showing my id since he said that he didn't know me, that was not enough. He wanted to write down all of my personal information from my driver's license onto my own check; wanted me to remove my license from its plastic container. It was bad enough that the man could not read well and comprehend what was being said about a Wells Fargo checking account. When another man, the purported manager, Mathew, came over, he would not cash the check because the teller wouldn't, and in spite of the fact---know your customer---that he knew me, acknowledged that he knew me, but he just wasn't going to cash my check without writing down all of my personal information. Two days before I had deposited $2500 by endorsing another personal check written on Bank of America to me, signed by me, and they had no problem taking my money. At the same time as all of this a young man who identified himself as being from out of town went to the teller next to me. He had lost his debit card. He pulled out his phone and scrolled through information, gave the teller the last four digits of his social security number, and entered his account information into a pin-pad and received $120 in cash from the teller. There were about a dozen construction workers in the lobby waiting to handle their banking. I was traumatized by these poorly trained men who work for Wells Fargo. Since Mathew, the purported manager refused to cash my check, I walked over to Bank of America on Union Street. Mary in the right hand teller spot pleasantly greeted me by name, asked what she could do for me, and I explained my problem. I presented my Wells Fargo check, signed by me, made out to me, endorsed to me, and told her my Bank of America checking number, and she handed me my $100 and told me to have a nice weekend. Meanwhile, the customer complaint number at Wells Fargo--1-844-931-2273 was useless. In spite of calling three different days to give the information concerning the discriminatory behavior by an employee and his manager, the ""area marketing"" supervisor never called, and Wells Fargo refused to give out the name or number of another superior supervisor or anyone who was responsible for addressing ""inappropriate behavior, workplace disruption, situations that may result in potential customer harm, or situations that may warrant sending a team member home for the day"" as set forth in the Wells Fargo Team Member Handbook dated January 2017.

The were very willing to work with me on several occasions and often would refund an overcharge fee to me without even asking. This bank has minimal costs and fees that they rarely charge me. I think they might be trying to act with good behavior since they are trying to repair their image. I think that this makes their customer service and quality better than other banks right now.

Occasionally the app will say it is unavailable, however it typically functions very well.

It is not something that I think about often but I do believe that it is the best option for banking. Their online website is very easy to use. I am able to transfer money simply and quickly. Their app is also easy to use but I prefer the desktop version. I am constantly transferring money and checking balances as I have two checking accounts and one savings accounts. I also have automatic transfers setup to transfer money from my checking to my savings weekly and this has always been seamless.

When you have a credit card with them, they offer rewards. I think I have cashed out 5 times since I have been with them. The rewards are great, and it makes up for any negativity you might have with them. The customer service team is so helpful, and will typically reply to your inquiries within one day.

1552,Wells Fargo's Disgustingly Immoral Business Practices,25391,51,Wells Fargo Bank,33680,1,"I work for a small business that had been with Wells Fargo for years. We never really had an issue with them until the last few months. In light of the scandal it seems they are doing anything in their power to prey on customers. Being that we were with them for awhile, they knew the flow of our financials all to well. Every month we have a few hundred thousand coming in an a few going out. Around the 20th when sales tax is due and a few other large expenses they knew our account would reach just under $10,000. We recieve funding checks from other financial institutions on customer vehicle purchases. A few months ago I went to the local branch to do my routine deposit on the 22nd. My deposit consisted of a check for close to $9,000 from PFS Financial and a check for $4000 from Nicholas Financial. Now mind you these are the same checks that I have deposited for years. All of a sudden a 7 day hold was placed on my deposit. I was confused and seriously upset. They knew our flow of income and expenses. They knew that placing a hold during that time of the month would wreak havoc. Needless to say they were complete assholes and wouldn't release the hold even after 4 appointments with the business banker. I kept getting dodged by the bank manager and the customer service bankers were even being cold towards me. They ended up collecting their overdraft fees, I felt really let down and pissed off. We went and opened an account at another bank but I didn't close the Wells account. We had been there so long and so many transactions would take time to transition to a new bank. We overcame that but then they did it again. They held more deposits. These deposits are not checks from individual people, they are checks from other banks!!!! But being that they created the overdrafts on the first hold they had an excuse to hold again. They had no right or reason to hold my deposit the first time and had they let the deposit go through like they have been for years no overdrafts would've occured. I don't understand what is going on with Wells but I feel bullied by them and it's not right. Small businesses are what makes this country the greatest nation on the planet. The American dream choked by an asshole entity named Wells Fargo. They didn't destroy us but they sure as hell lost our business for life.",2016-10-29
1553,Wells Fargo for banking relationships,25383,51,Wells Fargo Bank,33670,5,My husband has had this account for years. After Bank of America took advantage of us we decided that we would move everything over to his account. We had not used it for years and kept a minimal balance in the account. After a misunderstanding with one of credit cards we were charged several fees. We paid the fees and left the bank. Just as we were leaving the cashier came out and said I wanted to tell you because of the length of your relationship with us I was able to reverse the fees. This act of kindness saved us over $200! I was so impressed with the way this young woman went out of her way to help us I felt so grateful. We have been there for seven years and my husband has had this account for over ten years.

I have 3 account on from Wells Fargo and it is very convenient to have all of my account all on one page to view. There online banking is kept up to date and I have never have any issues of my online account not matching the amount I actually have in the bank. I also like how the accounts will still show you your pending charges even on weekends and holidays when the bank is closed. I have had to contact Wells Fargo when I was a victim of identity theft. Someone got a hold of all of my online information including access to my online banking and stole all of my money out of my accounts. Wells Fargo was excellent at repairing this issue for me and setting me up with new account and new information to get back on to the online website. I have been banking with Wells Fargo for over 14 years and using their online banking for the majority of that time. I also use the online bill pay option on their website which makes it really easy to pay bill, especially since I easily forget to pay some of my bills.

1555,Will Never Bank With WF Again,25159,51,Wells Fargo Bank,33237,1,"Right before my WF incident i was banking with another popular bank (i wont say their name) i hadnt used my account in awhile and i recieved a letter stating i had some checks wrote to my account which had bounced. At the time i thought nothing of it cause i knew i had no money in the account and i knew there was no bills being debited from the account and also i knew i hadnt used my bank card in months so nothing could happen.. WRONG! This bank as well as WF lets you recieve half the money on a ATM deposited check.. Needless to say 3 checks at the amounts of  300-800$ was deposited and later there was cash withdraws from the ATM. Basically I was up the creek without a paddle. I was going to just pay what was owed and start fresh  but I was told by a ""close friend"" (the same close friend who lived with me at the time of the checks) to open a bank account with WF because this ""friend"" used them as well. Not to long after i opned my new account i noticed this ""friend"" switched banks but i thought nothing of it. I had direct deposits of some checks every two weeks and this ""friend"" knew the amount and the day of the deposit. My ""friend"" had been with me plenty of times ive entered my bank card pin# and possibly been around my bank card alone (being as how we lived together). Now looking back i remember my ""friend"" would go to any means for me not see their pin #..  At this time i never thought to get onlinebanking or the mobile app. I had no suspision that anything was wrong. But then when my statements would come in I started noticing withdraws and card swipes i didnt make myself or i would go to the ATM for cash and my count would be way off from the ATMs.. Example: i drop my ""friend"" off in a  near by big city and i went to the spend some time with my children. (Mind u he left on bad terms, we was aruging) The last statement i was noticing something funny  so i made sure this day with my kids i used the ATM once i got out a big enough withdraw i wouldnt have to use my card for the rest of the day and i also keap the reciept.  When the statemnt came out ( and my ""friend"" was home and well again) i seen at the same time in that near by city where i dropped my ""friend"" my card was being used to buy 2 movie tickets, wash someones car and also put gas in their car. I went to WF the nxt day and they refunded my account, cancled my card and sent me a new one. But dumb me used the same pin # (bad memory lol) So now im still not thinking anything of the ""friend"" continued on, added another direct deposit, still dnt think to check my online banking and i also added a couple thousand dollar savings account that would help with over drafting my checking. I did all this because WF made me feel safe with another new card and i simi new account. (I couldnt have a completly new account because of my affairs still pending with the other bank i used before) WF made what they called a merged account. Different account number, and new card but souly connect to my old account for everything to just ""merge"" over. Well by then my ""friend"" was gone so i started feeling alittle more secure again. (Secretly his ""partner in crime"" who knew all his tricks. I always suppected this person of helping but i thought once my ""friend"" was gone this ""pic"" would be also but i was dead wrong) Any ways suspisions arrouse again and yet again more transactions, the same bank card number and pin #. After this time I started being more careful. I would go into WF and check on online statements every once in awhile so as not to use the mobile app or online banking. I even went as far as to ask  a banker if it was possible for someone to order a duplicate of my bank card or even so make a duplicate some how them selves. She informed me no there was no way this was possible. (Now knowing what i know there is a couple im close with they both use the same bank account with 2 different cards but both cards have the same card #, same ex date, and same CVW code but different names for each person. So YES its possible)But yet i seen some transfers from my savings to my checking with the mobile app. I even had bank txting so that if my account was below a certin amount id get a txt and catch the peraon red handed. But there was even ATM withdraws and ATM transfers i didnt make myself. Which keap my account from dropping into the low for a txt to be sent. By this time i had decided to us only one ATM and at one bank desination no matter where i was i would drive back to that certin ATM at that certin bank. The same bank i reviewed my online statements  from. So every where i used my banking MYSELF would have the same bank code! I enformed WF i wanted to follow up on this and possibly do a more intensive search on the matter. They informed me to do so i had to make a police report on every single transaction i thought wasnt posted by me. During this time it had already been from Jan to Sept before i thought i had enough evidence for even consulting  with WF without sounding crazy, so there was months to go thru for a police report. But i did as they said. I made the report. One by one going thru them all with the police, sounding crazy as hell, saying there was a duplocate card made to my account and i thought someone was spending my money for me! Trying to explain i know myself and i know my spending and i wouldnt have spent thousands in a month or two plus the store i dnt shop at the ATMs i dnt use. I gave names and left copies of my findings. The police informed me i have something to start a case with and they be happy to look at ATM tapes and store tapes and all the above but first i need to file a claim with for all my missing items with WF. I call WF and tell them the report number and i try to file a cliam. After all this WF informs me that they can only go bck 90 days from the day i was trying to file the claim. Which was that day! Never telling me this before, i was pissed! I had already went thru all that with the police report, endless nights and days of going thru my account statments, signing up to watch my credit score with WF, signing up for identity theft protection with WF, the policr, the report. Now they tell me THEY ONLY GO BACK 90 DAYS! WTF was the point in letting me do all that? Needless to say after thousands of dollars gone and all within the span of a yr and a half i left the report and claim unfinished, i left the ""friend"" alone for sure, and also i closed my account with WF.. ive never felt as unsafe, unprotected, or even unappericated as a customer before from any company. I understand i may have sounded like a crazy person at times but as a customer i feel as tho if i come in with a money problem and your company holds my money in their possession and you yourself are not the problem then help me solve the problem.

I signed up for it, then called the bank back and complained and they canceled the savings account. to be honest I can't remember what the reason for the discussion about the savings account was all about. I have been a wells fargo checking account customer for about ten years, due to opening a checking account in about 1992 in a different bank that was sold twice and eventually ended up as wells fargo. I have normally had good service at wells fargo and if I did not I would go to a supervisor and the problem was resolved. in my opinion, their cd rates are horrible like a lot of banks.

And during that time I have not had one problem with fraudulent charges, until very recently that is. I woke up to chec my account balances like any other day, only this particular morning I unfortunately realized I was approximately $540 shorter then I should have been. Immediately I made contact with a bank rep through their standard 188 number. And within 10 minutes I was informed that my account would be credited back. Not only that but a full investigation would be launched on my behalf from the Wells Fargo fraud dept. And my bank account would not have to be frozen during this inquiry. Two weeks later I received a full report of the how's, when's, why's, and who's. Thank you Wells Fargo for keeping me and my finances safe.",2016-09-27

They always go above and beyond to fulfill the needs of their customers. They also look out for their customers. Recently the bank noticed suspicious activity on my debit card. They immediately notified me and sent me out a new card within four days. I've also made great use of their cash back program on their credit card where for the first six months you earn 5% cash rewards on gas and grocery purchases. Then 1% cash back on all other purchases all the time. It's been great to pay off my credit card through my purchases. I have a checking and savings account with them as well. Both of my teenagers have had savings accounts at Wells Fargo since they were little and recently have opened checking accounts. I rarely actually go into the bank anymore, but when I have had to, the bank employees are always very helpful and friendly. I really can't say enough good things about Wells Fargo.

She's been a customer since they bought out Norwest Bank back in the 1990's. Recently, she tried to order a new debit card with a chip over the phone, but because she couldn't remember her verbal password (she rarely calls) they told her that they were unable to help her.

1563,ENDING MY 5YEAR BUSINESS WITH THIS BANK,23719,51,Wells Fargo Bank,29686,1,"I've been a loyal Wells Fargo customer for 5 years and I ended it just now. It started when I switched over from joint bank account to a new on several months ago. I was under the impression that it was the same College Student account, but it turned out it wasn't. So for being unable to meet the conditions for that new account (having at least $1,500 in account, direct deposit of at least $500, and having at least 10 transactions with my debit card), I was charged $10 to use the checkings account. Before, when I had the college student account, having automatic transfer of $25 monthly from checkings to savings was enough to keep my account free. I called them to have take the charge back since I have >$2000 in m account after learning the conditions, but they won't or they're saying they can't. If they think that losing a loyal customer is worth it over losing $7.50 over, then they can have that $7.50 and I'm gone. Now, who would pay $10/month for a checkings account? NOT ME! There are too many banks around who offer FREE checkings account just for you to do business with them. My credit score would probably take a dip from closing my accounts with them, but I'm sure it will bounce back. GOOD BYE WELLS FARGO!",2016-04-20

So far my experience has been very positive. Setting up my checking and savings account was incredibly easy, along with moving over my money from my previous bank. Wells Fargo offers a savings plan which includes adding a dollar to every purchase you make, and automatically adds this to your savings account. This was very convenient for me, as I steadily built up more and more savings over time. <br/> <br/>Customer service has been great as well. Every time I had an account issue or just a quick question their representatives have been very polite and helpful and made the whole process run incredibly smoothly.",2016-03-17

I had been in a tough financial situation due to making a cross country move from the Midwest. Nobody in California wanted to give me a bank account due to my lack of collateral. Wells Fargo was not like that. They gave me a bank account suitable to my needs and a savings account. In addition to the modest checking account they provided me with the help and guidance to improve my credit. Once back on my feet I continued to have no problem with them. My savings and checking accounts have been of great use to me over the years. Wells Fargo's website has never given me any problems. Their mobile banking system has always been useful and helpful without being confusing on my cell phone in addition to my PC.

I, at the time was awaiting another deposit of around the same amount. A week goes by I check my balance & it appeared as though I received the other deposit .... so I proceed to pay bills. TWO weeks later my account is more than $500 over drawn. Come to find out 5 (or more) business days later these guys redeposited the same deposit, so in fact it was NOT the other deposit I was awaiting. @ weeks later they withdrew the money AGAIN. This has put me in a SERIOUS BIND, & guess whose shoulders it is falling on? Mine. I will no longer be banking with them after this is taken care of.

1571,Wells Fargo Review,21614,51,Wells Fargo Bank,24007,5,"I have had a very good experience with Wells Fargo. I actually got my first bank account at age 16 with Wachovia because they were one of the few banks without a minimum balance requirement for a checking account, being 16 years old I didn't have 500 or 1000 bucks to put into a checking account at the time. It worked fine for me and then Wachovia was purchased by Wells Fargo so my checking account just rolled over to them and the transition was seamless, I even kept my exact same account and routing number and still can use my original Wachovia checks. After a short while I opened a savings account with them and began using the $1 deposit everytime I use my debit card because then I would be able to avoid the $5 fee on my checking account. This worked fine for several years and it came time I decided I wanted to get my first credit card, well after researching thoroughly I had my mind set on a cash back card and applied for a few different ones but was declined due to lack of credit of course. But Wells Fargo actually accepted my application and I now have a 1% cash back card with 5% on some items and a $1000 credit limit with a fairly reasonable interest rate. And the card even has 15 months no interest financing. I believe the fact that I was a customer for ~4 years or so with no overdrafts and a fairly consistent balance showed them that I was responsible enough to own the card and it has given me the opportunity to begin building my credit with a really great credit card that rewards me for using it.",2015-06-24

I called the Wells Fargo customer service and was very nicely advised that they would not do anything, and that no one had authority to do anything.

We opened our accounts before we had children and at that time we only used a checking and a savings account. After we had our children we opened savings accounts for them. Every employee we have had an interaction with whether it be in the branch in our town, online, or on the phone has been exceptional. We love their online banking and budget help, you can plan your monthly budget and itemize your purchases.

The few times that I have had a problem with their service, they just call over a manager to help resolve it. All of their account options are perfect for any amount of wealth and they don't charge any crazy fees.

Believe or not, these transfers are blind transfers, i.e. they do not get a confirmation from the recipient before they send money to a black hole. That is correct, there is no number at all to track that transaction! The number they give you in an email only indicates ""we sent money"", it is not connected to the actual transfer! They have to assign a claim specialists to actually make a phone call to the intended bank and ask ""do you have our money?"" If not then the specialists has to try to follow the money trail. AND UNTIL THEY FIND IT AND GET IT BACK INTO THEIR BANK THEY WILL NOT REFUND THE MONEY FROM YOUR ACCOUNT! <br/>I have had to resort to MAILING CHECKS through the Post Office to my daughter rather than transfer funds!<br/>Their Bill Pay is flawed with bugs. Any change to your automated monthly payment account may generate duplicate payments. And when this happens, AGAIN they have to assign a specialists to research why and where the money went and UNTIL THEY GET THE MONEY THEY SENT ERRONEOUSLY THEY REFUSE TO CREDIT THE MONEY BACK TO YOUR ACCOUNT!<br/>I have finally decided to change banks.

I feel WF is waiting for all my bills to bounce so they can collect their fees and take as much of the money as they can. Another thing on the 22nd I notice an online charge coming through so I deposited $25 to make sure it cleared. Both the credit and debit cleared the bank on the 23rd but on the 24th WF charged me $35 for so called insufficient funds. They posted the deposit but would not credit it to my account till after the debit went through.

However, once I got out of college my checking and savings account had a fee that became attached with it. Now unless I automatically transferred $25 dollars a month to savings I would have to pay a monthly fee. I found this pretty ridiculous. However, I just let it transfer for me and then I usually transfer it right back. I will give the bank credit their customer service is usually very good. I usually can walk into the bank and be addressed and solve my problems quickly. They always have tellers and bankers on hand who are decently knowledgeable.

I called customer service and they were rude and talked to me like a child when I said I didnt understand.<br/><br/>Here is what they are doing, yes cash deposits, including direct deposit are available to use your debit card or take cash from the ATM. HOWEVER that money IS NOT available to pay checks and automatic debits. Yes thats is correct. They put a 24 hour ""pending hold"" on the cash. So if a check or arch comes in there is no money available and they charge you overdraft fees.<br/><br/>Social security says your money is to be make available to you on pay day, so wells fargo lets you use your card but not pay your bills. I just spent 3 days contacting people and trying to get them to change the due date from the 3rd to the 4th.<br/><br/>So tomorrow when I can get cash, I will be opening a new account with another bank and wells fargo can take their overdraft fees and stick them where the sun dont shine!",2015-04-02

All of a sudden hours later I got a message from Wells Fargo saying that my account had insufficient funds for some of the bills I had just paid and also that there is a charge for each bounced transaction. I totally freaked out and called them and said that I should have had over $1000 deposited from a few paychecks I receive from 3 sources. They said the deposits weren't there. After talking with someone, I explained that I have excellent credit and have never bounced any checks or payments in many years. I asked them to check my account to verify that and to check with the manager if necessary to delete all of the charges that were accumulating in my account. The clerk had the authority to delete the charges and I love that she was empowered to do so, without waiting for a manager to become available. The agreement we made was that once the monies were deposited they would process the transactions that were pending and delete the charges against my account. In fact that same day all paychecks were deposited and my account was all clear and positive. They could have made me pay the charges and would have had that right to do so, but looking at my loyalty and good credit and also listening to the customer and CARING about the customer gave me a satisfactory outcome.

This took multiple trips to the bank to accomplish, but I was ultimately successful. While I disagree with Well Fargo's practices as a whole, this branch is excellent. Wells Fargo charges overly large fees for its accounts, and often doesn't disclose those fees prior to implementing them. However, this branch can't be held accountable for that. What I perhaps find most interesting is how well this bank does in comparison to other branches. When visiting other branches, for example, I was told that what I wanted was impossible to do with Wells Fargo more generally, but the Clayton branch did an excellent job ensuring that my needs were met. They worked hard, and seemed genuinely apologetic when all my needs couldn't be met on my first visit. However, after two visits, my needs were taken care of, and everything was solved.

Surprisingly, a representative with the Franchise Tax informed me that it had been a mistake on their part and my checking account had be wrongly (attacked) debited. The Franchise Tax department assured me on 2/24/15 that the mistake will be corrected immediately as a notice “to release account” will be sent to the legal department of Wells Fargo and then all monies and fees charged due to this (wrong doing) error would be corrected and my checking account will be credited as it should. <br/>Almost two weeks later, from the date of the imposition on my checking account, I received a letter from Wells Fargo regarding “ Required withdrawal from your account ending in 7476”. Wells Fargo stated in the letter that $0.00 amount was debited from my account however, a bank fee of $103.00 and another bank fee of $22.00 was additionally debited from my account by Wells Fargo. This action does not make any sense especially when a notice was sent to your (Wells Fargo) attention that the action of Franchise Tax was wrong, noting a letter “to release account” and credit all fees back to my checking account.<br/>I am not a rich person and money does not come my way that easy! It is absurd and ridiculous on the part of Wells Fargo in that such predatory behavior of imposing fees on my checking account in the manner stated above. I did not authorize the action on my account. The action was a mistake by Franchise Tax which they very politely and kindly assured me would be corrected. Only to have the predatory and merciless behavior of my bank, Wells Fargo, in raping me of off the little money that I had in my checking account. <br/>I like to presume that this predatory behavior to make money using legal tactics, is used a lot more against people and businesses that have a lot more assets… and the extortion of thousands and probably millions of dollars being taken away (from people) by the “so called” (predators like yourself ) big banks which would lead to poverty or perhaps death for some.<br/>Before I close, I want to also remind you, Wells Fargo, that you have to do a better job in the hiring of some of your representatives, both on lines and local area bank locations. They are seemingly, uneducated, unprofessional, immature, and additionally don’t know what they are doing in regard to their jobs, and very rude.<br/>My letter may not be what you will expect, but at this point I am piss-mad at your bad behavior that it makes me feel wonderful in expressing my guts in this manner! Luckily, I am a person of integrity, otherwise, I feel like I should address You (Wells Fargo) in the exact manner that you, predatory big banks choose to behave in taking advantage of individuals and small businesses through legal maneuvers!<br/>Finally, I will be very appreciative if you will reasonably (put back) credit my checking account and take away the unnecessary and improper fees you have imposed.",2015-03-09

1587,Love The App!,20405,51,Wells Fargo Bank,15896,5,"It was long overdue, but I recently just started using WF's app. It's so great, and the smaller banks don't have the resources to offer services this good. I can deposit checks by taking a photo which is pretty much the greatest thing since sliced bread.",2015-03-02
1588,WF review,20306,51,Wells Fargo Bank,22178,2,This bank has horrible customer service and high fees. My checking account was overdrafted and the fee was $35. I called to see if the bank would reverse the fee as I was only overdrafted by a few dollars and they refused. I have carried an account with them for more than 5 years. Finally after talking to a supervisor in customer service the bank reduced the fee by $8. I am dissatisfied with my experience and think the fees are much too high. This bank only cares about revenue and people with a high balance. The bank doesn't care about people who carry a balance under $500. Their atm was also out of order for a week. It wouldn't accept deposits. I called to complain but the bank didn't seem too concerned. I will be switching banks as soon as I have a regular income.,2015-03-01
1589,Never EVER Get Suckered Into A Home Equity,20367,51,Wells Fargo Bank,22223,1,"In 1958, I established my first checking account, with Wachovia, for a happy half-century relationship with a courteous and efficient staff. With the W-F buyout, things changed drastically. I had established a home equity line of credit, thinking to use it in an emergency situation.<br/>Last December I chose to use it for the balance of an unexpected home purchase due to severe arthritis and osteoporosis forcing me to leave my beloved hillside condo. Rather than go through the red tape of a mortgage, I thought I would get the home equity loan and repay it as security redemptions came in. On 12/9 I obtained a $45,000 loan and went on vacation for the holidays. On my return in January I paid $22,000 before the first monthly payment became due. Later that month, I paid an additional $11,000+. Last week unprecedented snows hit as I received a payment notice from Wells Fargo. I was unable to get out of my complex but didn't worry about the minimum payment as I had already paid off 3/4 of the loan in less than 60 days. I was so WRONG! Last Saturday, home-confined with black ice covering our roads, I received a call from their collections department informing me I was five days late with my minimum payment and must pay immediately. I authorized a payment of over eight thousand dollars (she did, under the circumstances, waive the late penalty!) Today I was able to get to the local branch to pay off the balance. The customer representative here was shocked that I questioned why a minimum payment was required when I had paid off 75% of the total already. She, with smug condescension, informed me there is ALWAYS a minimum payment due regardless of any extra payment I would want to make. So today I settled up and made my farewells...after 57 years. I normally despise gutter language, W-F, but I find your initials quite apropos ~",2015-02-27
1590,Wells fargo is okay but not the greatest.,20180,51,Wells Fargo Bank,21970,3,"After i moved from Florida to Oregon I switched my bank to wells Fargo on account of my previous bank not being in the area. When I signed up everything seemed to be fairly good and things proceeded well, but I ran into hard financial times and then the fees started hitting me. I started paying 10 dollars a mount for a banking account because I didn't have over 2000 dollars in the account. Then i over drafted once and the fee was 35 dollars. Eventually my account was closed for being about 1 dollar in the red. I then had to open up a new account which is under a ""second chance"" system. Which basically made everything a big hassle, and checks took quite a while to clear. I ended up closing that account and switching to a simple greendot card.",2015-02-14
1591,Very Poor Customer Service!,20084,51,Wells Fargo Bank,21851,1,"Very poor customer service - poor enough to close all my accounts with Wells Fargo and go elsewhere. It's too bad because I like the folks at my local branch, and was always treated with kindness and respect. Wells Fargo started charging me a $10.00 maintenance fee on one of my accounts without any explanation, because my other accounts are not being charged this same fee. Everything was fine when the account was first set up, but now I'm being hit with a $10.00 fee. I had no intentions of finding a new bank, but my search is on. They lost a 10+ year customer over $10.00 and they could really care less. Reading other reviews, I see I'm not alone. GOOD BYE WELLS FARGO!",2015-02-06
1592,What ISN't Wrong With Wells Fargo?,19854,51,Wells Fargo Bank,21593,1,"I have had the misfortune of dealing with Wells Fargo (not by choice) in various scenarios where they failed miserably. <br/>1. Our previous home that we were renting out and now have up for sale was originally a First union loan, purchased by Wachovia then Wells Fargo. No issues til Wells Fargo came into the picture. We had received an offer from them to refinance the home as I had a bit of equity built up. Just after I had given the agent ALL of my personal information + my first born required for this transaction, the agent disappeared into thin air. Voice amil still set up, but full - n replies to emails, or return calls from his manager. Found out WEEKS later he had left Wells when he requested me as a contact on Linked In. He assumed my account had been handed off, but no such luck. I found that the only way for Wells to return my calls & emails was to file a BBB complaint. We did not refinance with them, we went to Chase. <br/><br/>2. Recent storms had caused roof damage to the same house and my contractor recommended I file an insurance claim for the damages. While State Farm cut the first check within a week, because the house had been part of a bankruptcy TEN years ago, wells had to endorse the check. Their reasoning was they needed to make sure the work actually got done and I did not pocket the $. They thought the most effective way to protect themselves is to hold the check for 2 weeks, have us fedex them an inch of paperwork, wait another two weeks for that to be ""processed"" and then give the contractor 1/3 of the materials check, totalling $1200. (The entire job was $15,000 and should have taken 4 days) Once the job was 1/2 done (which happened before we even got the check), we had to request an inspection (5-6 business days for them to call to set an appt, plus another 5-10 business days for them to inspect). Once the inspector filed paperwork and it was processed (up to 5 business days) they would issue a check for $3800 (5-10 business days to process & receive). By that time state Farm had issued the final check for $8000 (i had a deductible) and Wells suggested we start the entire process over again with this check. I went ballistic. It has now been 4 MONTHS to complete what should have occurred within 4 DAYS. more paperwork and 15 phone calls including an exception request (5 business days) I finally have the check in an account, and NOW they want to HOLD half of it for 2 WEEKS !!!!! <br/><br/>3. On the mortgage for this same house, I have not received any statements for 10 years due to the bankruptcy (illegal to attempt collection on a bankruptcy, it was a ""retain & pay"" so I paid online each month thru MY bank (NOT WF) Well, as a result of the above I was granted access online to my mortgage. Upon first perusal, I discover that there are many payments made where the ENTIRE payment is credited to Interest, and zero to principal. This loan is in its 14th year of 30!! There is NO WAY there should be any interest-only payments. I look further and find NO rhyme or reason to the amount credited to int vs. princ. It is completely random, like they picked numbers from a hat. I call to discuss with an agent, they tell me that interest accrues for every day the payment is late. But that doesnt jibe with the reports. There are months I paid early and it is an interest-only payment, and there are months I paid late and 70% of the payment went to principal (which is about where it should be). The agent finally agreed that SOMETHNIG was really messed up. So what is the best she could do? Fax me a copy of the original note and the entire payment history. and how long does it take her to send me a fax? why, 7-10 business days of course!!",2015-01-23
1593,Best Bank to have a home with.,19771,51,Wells Fargo Bank,21479,5,"I have been a homeowner since 2013 and My experience with having a mortgage with Wells Fargo has been great. In Jan 2013 I started to look for a home and I had went into a Wells Fargo center and the experience was beyond amazing. The personal banker knew exactly what he was saying, she showed me step by step and also she has a personal testimonial which made me feel that I can trust her. As the month were passing by she kept in touch with us to where it made it seem like she actually cared. She was always on top of us and also the realtor. She made our whole experience into a great one. Our closing took only 45 days and I was so happy I wrote a letter to higher management explaining my experience and since that I have brought over 50 people to this branch to open accounts.",2015-01-18
1594,Overall good experience with Wells Fargo,19727,51,Wells Fargo Bank,21408,5,"I have been using Wells Fargo for almost 10 years now, and most of my interactions have been very positive. Earlier this year I lost my debit card- I was expecting a long process for getting it replaced, but I was in and out of the bank in 15 minutes with a temporary card. My new card came about a week later. I use the app quite a bit to deposit checks, it's usually prompt (although submitting the pictures can be a little temperamental). I used to have a problem with overdraft charges from overdrawing my checking account until I linked it to my savings account. Once I did this I stopped having an issue, but I kind of wish this service was recommended to me before. I overdrew 3 or 4 times before I realized linking my checking to my savings was an option. Overall, most of my interactions with Wells Fargo have been positive despite a few minor issues.",2015-01-15
1595,This Bank Is Just A Bunch Of Theives,19655,51,Wells Fargo Bank,21284,1,"I have been with wells fargo for years and recently I had some overdraft fees. I had the money in my account to cover 2 of the bills that came out but not the 3rd. They gave me an overdraft fee for all 3! I expected 1 for the 1 bill that I didn't have enough to cover the day it came out, no problem that was my own fault but when there was money in the account to cover 2 of them and left a positive balance after those 2 were taken out and then I still get charged 3 overdraft fees is absolutely insane! They took $70 from me that was not theirs and for no reason and when I called about it they refused to reverse it! The lady I talked to even said she seen exactly what I was saying and understood my point of view but her system wouldn't allow the reversal and she was a supervisor. I will be closing my account with them as soon as I find a better bank.",2015-01-08
1596,Nickle and Dime,19550,51,Wells Fargo Bank,21152,3,I have to say I do not want to ever be part of this banking institution ever again. Wells Fargo will eat your bank account up with fees and penalties that will drain the funds of someone on a budget. It was very slow at work and I did not have a large amount of money in the bank. The stress of making sure there was enough money in my account to pay my monthly fees was starting to get to me. The day came when I did not have enough money in my account and then I ended up with a negative balance. The amount they charge you to use another banks ATM is just as bad. I had to pay over 8 dollars in combined ATM fees one time.Wells Fargo is a OK bank if you have a lot of money but if your are scraping by go to a bank or credit union that waves some of the mentioned fees. Why should you pay large fees to use your own money? Are you just paying for a name?,2014-12-31
1597,Checking Accounts Fees,19489,51,Wells Fargo Bank,21093,1,"Needed an account that I could use nation wide as I travel often. I told the bank rep what I did and how I used my money. She advised me to open 4 different accounts and were all free with no monthly fees. I used two of them the first two months and noticed one had a $51 fee for usages. I contacted the bank and was told these fees were because the accounts were setup wrong and it could be changed. I asked if I made the necessary changes would the fees be returned since it was a bank error and was told no, I still had to pay the fees. I closed all accounts and moved to another bank. I don't do business with thieves.",2014-12-28
1598,Worst Of The Worst,19428,51,Wells Fargo Bank,20993,1,"I use to love banking at Wachova as they treated me with respect and courtesy and was really disappointed when Wells Fargo bought them out. This bunch over at Wells Fargo, especially the branch in Boerne, Texas, is about as bad as it gets. They could care less about customer service, never return your phone calls, and, in general, have never heard of customer service. It's like a foreign language to them. The only decent person there is the branch manager who will go out of her way to help you. Otherwise all the personal bankers, loan officers, and other administrative staff flunk the "" decent human being test"". And don't get me started on the so called brokerage advisors. The first one I had spent our meeting time rating and raving about President Obama, including blaming him for the demise of the space program. After that tirade I went to another advisor who was nice enough but put me into some investments totally at the wrong time and then refused to answer my phone calls about the investments. Stay clear or I guarantee you will be sorry.",2014-12-19
1599,Much easier to deal with then Bank of America,19399,51,Wells Fargo Bank,20959,5,"I've been a happy customer for two years now. Although the hours at my local branch aren't the best, the level of customer care I've received more than makes up for it. I've received all the help I've needed setting up checking and savings accounts,and I've been advised on retirement plans. When my identity was stolen, they handled the matter quickly and painlessly, and I had my money back in under 72 hours. The only thing I don't like it's there aren't many Wells Fargo ATMs, so if I do need cash I'm hit with fees from both ends. Overall though I'm very satisfied, and plan to remain a customer for the forseable future.",2014-12-19
1600,Lazy Customer,19274,51,Wells Fargo Bank,15896,4,"I've banked with Southtrust, Wachovia, and now WF as the bank has been acquired over the years. I am well aware that there are better choices out there (online banks with much more competitive product offerings, low fees, and ATM refunds), but the reason I've stuck with WF through the years is probably laziness (not wanting to go through the hassle of closing my accounts and opening new ones). Fees may be higher than some banks, but it's not an issue to me since I usually keep plenty of money in the bank to avoid getting in a situation where I could incur a fee. The only complaint I've had regarding their fees is an expedited debit card replacement fee that I felt was a little excessive. I ended up not paying this fee and just waiting a few weeks for my new card. Customer Service has always been excellent, and it's been nice to find WF branches and ATMs throughout the country. The bank's best attributes to me are its online and mobile features. I can deposit checks, pay bills, budget, etc all online. I rarely have need to go into a bank. One day, I might check out Ally Bank or one of the popular online banks, but for now WF is just fine for me.",2014-12-10
1601,"Research first, bank second.",19212,51,Wells Fargo Bank,20787,3,"Before you go into a Wells Fargo, It would be a good idea to know exactly what you want and how to tell if you are getting a good deal because the employees tend to not have a clue. Sure they can process an application, spin an amazing sales pitch, contingently dismiss any objections you have while downplaying your concerns. Now ask they why the APR and note rate on a loan are different and expect the deer in the headlights look. Product, sure its a major bank. They have all of the products and loans you can expect. Fees, well of course there are fees. Tons of them. Open a free checking account but wait a month for the first direct deposit check, that's an $8.00 fee. Get free overdraft protection and use it, that's a $30.00 fee. I guess the only positive to Wells Fargo is the website. It's laid out well, is always up and fairly easy to navigate.",2014-12-09

I have always receive very professional, courteous service and I feel like a valued customer. At one time, I had fraudulent charges of almost $3000 made to my account.

Although, there is only one issue i have with this particular bank, I'm not sure if other banks do this as well, but my father opened my account when i was younger so both of our SSN are on the account...this means that EVERY time my father's account is in the negative for whatever reason, the bank automatically takes money from my account and deposits it into his. Now the only way i will be able to stop this is to cancel my current account and open a new one, which i do not want to do. i don't see why they can't just stop taking my money even though his social is on my account.",2014-11-14

When ever there is overdraft I call them and they deduct it If I say them the reasonable excuse.

I have been with them for 11 years, and due to their exemplary service I do not plan on switching any time soon. When I walk into my local branch, I am greeted by name by bankers with whom I have dealt with in the past. They are kind, patient, and willing to listen to any questions or requests I have. Similarly, the Wells Fargo app and online banking options have greatly increased my satisfaction with the bank. The only concern I have is whether or not I only receive this treatment because of the relatively long time I have been with Wells Fargo. If I was a new customer, would they be more persistent in getting me to open additional accounts with them? Nonetheless, I am extremely happy with the service I get from Wells Fargo.",2014-11-12

Hidden fees are plentiful, and when you call or go in to speak with someone, you get nothing but the run around. I belong to another popular bank that my wife and I share accounts, and the comparisons make it easy to see why Wells Fargo is terrible. I would not be so unhappy, if I could just get some straight answers. I have two credit cards, a checking and two savings accounts. Comparing how these accounts are managed to my other bank, I almost feel cheated. I did not choose banks based on extras, but it sure is nice to get free stuff here and there based on my normal spending and saving patterns.

I got a different credit card with another bank because it gave out better rewards. I have had positive experiences with their customer service though. A year ago I got an email saying that my online account had been potentially hacked. One quick call and I had my accounts fixed with new security and new credit cards. The representative was very friendly and made the whole process very smooth. The only thing I would change with my current services is the fees on the Savings and Checking accounts.

The staff were always courtesy and attentive to my need. They always greet customers every time they come through the door. I sat down with the loan officer and she asked me for my personal information. We went over my credit check and what options were available to me. I was able to get a long term loan with a very competitive low interest. The whole process only took around 40 minutes and it wasn't that long at all even though there were a lot of paper work that needed to fill out. I was impressed with their professionalism and efficiency. Overall, I'm very happy with Wells Fargo and I can envision myself staying with them for a long time.",2014-09-02

After moving on from there I decided to branch out and find out if I could in fact be happy with another bank. I have so far been very impressed and happy with Wells Fargo. Because they are a larger corporation things tend to get done faster such as receiving atm cards, contacting customer service, online banking... The only downfall I have is the fact that the fees are significantly higher than the small town banks. Also with small town banks you are able to get a one time refund on a fee just for being a good customer.",2014-09-02
1621,Could offer lighter fees,17785,51,Wells Fargo Bank,18895,4,"The best part about Wells Fargo is that they have friendly bankers. All have wonderful attitudes and hooked me up with an account I could use. It's also very convenient with their features (mobile apps to deposit checks and bill pay). <br/>What Wells Fargo could work on however is bank fees. Or at least allow all members to have free cashier's checks no matter the circumstance especially after being a loyal customer of the bank for several years. Fees are too big for loans and some loans have a penalty for paying your loan off early. It doesn't seem very fair and it requires having to be extremely cautious with reading fine print. <br/> <br/>Overall though I would say Wells Fargo is not the best bank ever but they are certainly not the worst. I do enjoy the convenience of mobile banking and being able to pay bills and transfer funds between accounts within a moments notice. However, they could work a little harder to keep their already established clients. This has been my perception thus far banking through them.",2014-09-02
1622,One of the best banks in the country,17730,51,Wells Fargo Bank,18775,5,Wells Fargo is one of the best banks that I've ever used in my life. They provide an excellent web/app that I use frequently on a daily basis to check my accounts. Every bank branch that I've visited had people who were genuinely caring and very professional in giving me the best banking experience possible. They are very courteous and prompt with helping me out on any issue that I may have with my accounts. They also have great phone customer service and do not make you feel terrible about yourself.,2014-08-31
1623,Run The Other Way,17717,51,Wells Fargo Bank,18762,1,"Wells Fargo is the worst bank I have ever had the displeasure of encountering, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were the single worst bank in existence. The fees are large and frequent, the customer service is impossible, and there aren't even any benefits that might entice you to overlook all that. I'm amazed that anyone still banks with them at all. They are known to squeeze every cent they can from you in the most despicable ways, like this one: if you make a few purchases with a debit card, and maybe you're a little low on cash in that account, they'll process the BIGGEST purchase first, regardless of chronological order, to see if you overdraft and they can charge you a fee. Then, they'll process all the other, smaller transactions, exacting an overdraft fee on each one. Charming, no?",2014-08-29
1624,Bad employees,17701,51,Wells Fargo Bank,18746,1,"I switched banks and do not have a Wells Fargo account but I get a check for some services I do and the guy has an account with them. Since I pass the bank quite a bit I usually just cash it there. I've cashed countless checks with no issues until I came across a woman that just wanted to be difficult. They ask for 2 forms of ID and usually my driver license and Social Security card are fine. This time tho, she claimed it had to be 2 picture IDs, after standing in line and then arguing with her I wasted 10-15 minutes or more and still didn't get my check cashed. It didn't seem the manager wanted to be much help either as I waited for her and she never came to see what the issue was so I just left. Haven't went back there since and likely will never.",2014-08-28

1626,RECORD PROFITS/NO SERVICE/CONFUSING FEES,17684,51,Wells Fargo Bank,18711,1,"Wells Fargo is the ONLY bank in my small Alaska town. It has changed designations several times in the 20+ years I've lived here, and I never had any problem until Wells Fargo took it over. There went all the quick, local decision making, and in came long wait times for out-of-state decisions on loans, etc. Fees became incomprehensible... you can't count on the total cost of the bank account to be anywhere near the same from month to month. Extra charges can apply for: too many cash deposits, too low a balance, too many deposits, too much or too little activity; the list goes on and on. And they're posting record profits all while service declines. I now bank BY MAIL just to avoid Wells Fargo, and have for several years. I get a FREE, interest-bearing account, better service and consideration and have a great working relationship with Key Bank. I know my banker and get personal service for both my business and personal accounts. Wells Fargo? Worst. Bank. EVER!",2014-08-26
1627,Former Wells Fargo Customer,17636,51,Wells Fargo Bank,18621,4,"Wells Fargo was my bank of choice at first, because it's location near both my house and my university. I also used to have student loans through them before the federal government brought out the loans. However, I switched banks after the customer service experience proved to be less than satisfactory. When I called for customer service, I was hard pressed to find someone that I could clearly understand. One time, a customer service representative even sent my account information to the wrong e-mail, twice. At the location nearest to my house, the customer service was equally grim. At times, they would let you wait around forever before bothering to assist you.",2014-08-22

They have messed up both a Credit Card account and business checking account. (I am not getting into the complicated, nasty details.)<br/>Note, I am mainly talking about my credit card account experience.<br/>If you have Wells Fargo, my advice is to get to 3rd level support - it's worth the extra 10+ minutes to get there. Once you get to that level (supervisor's supervisor), they seem to know what they are doing and genuinely seem to want to help you.",2014-08-15

They have a reputation, but I think this comes with any kind of really big bank. The particular WellsFargo location I visited was in a small town, and a lot of the employees there felt like down-to-earth folks. This location seems to understand the needs of the people of the town they operate in. For example, there were special rates for employees at X, which is a huge university in the area. They give you a free credit card that is attached to your bank account, and a free debit card as well. Fees are very minimal, as long as you don't overdraft! All in all, I'd recommend them. But if I made more money, I'd probably seek out a place with better interest rates.",2014-08-14

I refuse the offer but its as if they believe after the 20th time I will say yes. Not to mention I have been called on my personal phone and offered the same accounts.

A few negative things are that whenever I go into an office location, they always try to sell me something or try to get me to open a new account.

She helped me a lot, however, she told me that Wells Fargo was not a place to save your money. This bothered me because I had just opened a savings account and checking account with them. I think their fees are easily avoidable, my monthly fee is waved for making more than 10 purchases a month or having more than $2,000 in the portfolio. I like their website and I like their security on the website as well. I like how their ATMs deposit checks. I don't like how the machine holds onto your card until the transaction is over but they make up for it by not allowing you to get cash, reciepts, etc until the card has been removed. Overall, I like Wells Fargo. They treat me right.",2014-07-03

Then out of the blue, they started assessing a $10 monthly fee to maintain my checking account, even when new customers were not being charge that fee. I felt very manipulated about this poor service to a long term customer.

There have been times that I had to wait in a long line and someone walked around to apologize for the wait. That was very pleasant.,2014-07-01
1640,"For Small businesses, I like it!",16983,51,Wells Fargo Bank,17376,4,"Wells Fargo is pretty awesome for somebody who has a small business (and I mean small- I am the sole employee). There are no fees for a business checking/savings account (provided you have an automatic transfer go through every month from checking to savings). But I do admit, the one thing that bugs me with them is the fees. I'm charged $3 per session to be able to look at previous checks I have deposited and/or written. (I feel as if that should be a given). <br/>Everyone has been pretty friendly. The only issues I've had with the staff is very slow wait times if I need to talk to a banker (vs teller) and if I go through the drive through, they are almost always backed up.

1643,Fee Based Institution,16974,51,Wells Fargo Bank,17367,3,It is somewhat frustrating to have an account at this bank. The minimum balances and other requirements to avoid monthly fees are unreasonable. The average depositor does not have these minimums and other requirements.

Having the knowledge that people often stick to whatever financial institution they first become comfortable with has been paramount. I'm 28 years old and I still use the same checking account that I opened with them on Campus 10 years ago. They have accounts tailored to just about anyone's specific needs and there are minimal fees.

They have excellent customer service! I made a claim over an unauthorized transaction and a simple phone call and a few days later my issue was resolved. They reversed the charges immediately after I called and reached their conclusion in just three days. Whenever I walk into one of their branches or talk with one of their representatives on the phone, they are always friendly and eager to assist me. They even hold the door open for me when I leave!

My account stayed free because I am a student at this school, and they even converted my student ID into a ""secret"" debit card so I can use it like a debit card at some of the local shops. Whenever I've had an issue the employees have always been prompt and helpful. Transfers to my account from paypal and other similar sites take as long as they did for my old Key Bank account (3-4 days), but online the descriptions of where you spent your money and when are helpful. There are also maps and graphs of where you spend the most money, which is cool too, but I do a lot of online shopping so my graphs are mostly ""food"" and ""other"" so I guess it doesn't help me too much.

I opened a bank account with them right after they made the switch from Wachovia to WellsFargo and what a good switch it was. The brick and mortar stores are worth entering if you need an actual person for and they are always willing to help you out in any way they can. The online access (which I use 90% of the time) is pretty good and I can accomplish most of the things I need to do for my daily banking. The only negative issue I have with the bank is the interest rates on their savings accounts are very low...but I guess that is typical for any major bank these days.,2014-05-30

When we went inside to initially open the account we were greeted with friendliness and smiles from the tellers and directed to a banker who could help us open our account. They are extremely nice and were willing to help us and provide the correct answers for all of our questions. They also helped us sign up for online banking.

I was late paying my balance by six days because I was on business trips and thought the card would link to my accounts. Wells insisted to charge me high late fee. I paid it off. Wells Fargo is too much into money making and ignores good customer experiences. I have good services from other banks I am with.

My branch keeps moving people around to the point that hardly anyone there ever knows me. It took 3 months to get a bank mistake credited to my account (and 4 trips to the branch mgr.) The fees for business accounts are high, they nickel and dime you for online access and even viewing checks. Want check images with your statement? Pony up another $2/month. Meanwhile, it makes me sick that their rating based on deposit growth is A+. That's because the small banks that could USE your business and appreciate your business don't have enough customers.

1663,Banking With Wells Fargo An Exercise In Masochism,14877,51,Wells Fargo Bank,14098,1,"After spending several years as a Wachovia customer, I thought little of the changeover to Wells Fargo. That is until things started getting weird. Real weird. Things have come to a head this year, which has been downright ridiculous in regards to dealing with them. Here's a list of the troubles I have had since the beginning of 2013 alone.<br/><br/> - New debit card replacing an expiring one was deactivated as stolen or some such before I even had a chance to activate it in February.<br/><br/> - Replacement for that debit card being overnighted to me while the new PIN was sent standard mail. I was not asked to select a new PIN upon asking for the replacement and thus had a much harder time accessing cash for a good two and a half weeks, as my old PIN did not carry over and the new one was a mystery.<br/><br/> - $100-something check being read as a $200-something check and that was reversed after three weeks of ""investigation,"" which should not have taken nearly as long given the detailed explanation of the discrepancy I gave in the initial report and the scan of the check even I was able to see via their website.<br/><br/> - Negative balance on my account as a result of that error taking longer to alleviate due to payment issues with my job at the time led to the deactivation of the replacement debit card. This deactivation occurred despite the regular incremental deposits being made to rectify the issue, signifying the account had not been left to rot (as perhaps it should have been). Thankfully, while replacing the card a second time in only three months, I was asked to enter a new PIN for the one they sent overnight, so I wasn't as screwed this time around.<br/><br/> - Got charged for three overdrafts (due to a combination of circumstance and poor judgment) when only two should have been assessed. Upon receiving an explanation of why I'd been charged for three overages instead of two and doing the math with the figures they gave me, I found a small deposit from a side account that would have covered the largest transaction had not been figured into things despite having cleared the day before the overdrafts processed. My available balance at the time of the deposit was in excess of the largest charge I was expecting and the missing amount was the exact amount of that deposit. Still fighting this one as it was recent, but not getting my hopes up.<br/><br/> Banking with Wells Fargo is akin to stabbing oneself in the eye, although the stabbing would be greatly preferable.

1672,Worst Customer Service - Never Try To Apply For A Loan,12880,51,Wells Fargo Bank,12304,1,"I have banked with Wells Fargo for around 5-6 years now.  I am looking to switch ALL banking services to another bank after the way my husband and I and my parents have been treated when looking into their loans for refinance and home equity.  I understand the laws are very strict now thanks to a slew of irresponsible banking practices and even less responsible and informed customers taking advange of these and causing our current financial disasters.  However, I at least expect to get treated with respect and receive periodic updates on these processes along with accurate information UP FRONT on qualifications required.  When my husband and I inquired about a refinancing opportunity that WELLS FARGO CAME TO US ABOUT, I specifically asked up front what the required credit rating was, how they calculated that rating (so I could calculate for myself up front before letting them pull credit) and any additional requirements (such as debt to income ratio which is a common standard).  They provided me some basics on the credit rating and neglected to cover debt to income ratio at all and then declined us (AFTER SENDING NOTIFICATION WE WERE APPROVED WITH DOCUMENTS TO SIGN AND A REQUEST TO RETURN IN THE PROVIDED ENVELOPE) based on debt to income ratio.  They also could not clearly explain to me HOW they calculated their debt to income ratio - I only know that what I came up with was different than what they did, so no clue on that one.  I was using the standard I could find online - maybe I'm off, but I did actually ask that question up front and told them I did not want to apply if I couldn't clarify I met the basic requirements up front and they neglected to properly inform me on these.  Just to clarify again, I understand why we didn't get the refinance - I'm ok with that.  I'm terribly upset at how things were handled from a customer service perspective - we were misinformed of the requirements we requested up front and then NEVER contacted or properly notified on status or issue.  We received the decline notice several WEEKS after receiving an APPROVED notice!!<br/><br/> During all of this, my parents had already started an application (unfortunately) with this bank for a home equity loan.  They started this process in JANUARY and it is now nearing mid-March and we still have NO CLUE where we stand on them getting the loan.  The process has been extremely confusing and upsetting to my parents and we have requested multiple times to receive the ""elusive"" 3rd party verfication affidavit which would allow me to handle things on their behalf.  A MONTH later we finally got the form and then discovered that ALL prior documents received on the same day had be processed with the exception of this one.  So they continue to call my parents, my parents do not understand what more they are asking for, they call me, together we call the bank back so that I can hear first hand the request (after much hesitation on their part despite the fact my mom is on speaker phone right next to me) and then I finally am able to help get what is requested and send it in.  And you would think it is the most impossible request in the world to get a check list of what documentation is needed.... the list doesn't exist.  Instead, we send in information that gets processed incorrectly - we are on our third attempt to get the information right - only to call back ourselves multiple times leaving messages over the course of 1-2 weeks and finally get some random person who updates us that 1-2 weeks ago it was documented further information was needed.  If we never called, we would never know things were on hold pending more documentation we didn't have a clue they even needed!!  A little more competence and customer service would be nice.  Be warned, you will not get either if you use this bank for a loan - I highly recommend against it!<br/><br/> Unfortunately, we have so much time invested now it would probably send my parents (and a very pregnant me) into the hospital to consider starting over again.  Again, I understand strict government rules and regulations due to the financial crisis, but I also expect a certain level of customer service to go along with that and this bank just doesn't have it.  If you at least TELL me what the requirements are, we might have a prayer of meeting them - but unfortunately no one has the capacity to return phone calls there.  Only after you hound them and ask to speak to a manager do you get one more step ahead - which isn't saying much because there will just be another unknown road block in front of you.  By the way, my parents happen to have STELLAR credit - scores in the 800s, next to no debt and they are looking for a loan on a house that is PAID IN FULL!!  You would think people would be beating down their door to give them a small loan (we are only asking for a loan of ~22% of the value of the paid in full home to complete some landscaping and updates to the house!).<br/><br/> Just sad -

1682,"Broken Online Transfer System Causes Overdraft Fees, No Refunds.",11564,51,Wells Fargo Bank,10779,1," <br/>I wanted to transfer money from my Wells Fargo (WF) account to my PNC bank account, so I set up online transfers on October 13th, 2012. They told me that they would make small deposits to my PNC account, and I would have to verify the amounts before being able to make a transfer. When I did, the WF website showed me an error message, saying my account had been locked, and I would need to call customer service to have the issue resolved. Weird, but whatever. Then, during the span of about a month, I called five times to get the issue resolved, but each time I was put on hold for excessive amounts of time, told a representative would call me back, which never happened, or simply got an answer that it was not possible to fix the issue at the time. Because WF and PNC are my only two bank accounts, and WF is the one where my paychecks are deposited directly, I had no way to deposit money into my PNC account to cover the charges. There is a PNC branch in San Francisco, which is the nearest one to my house, but I wasn't willing to make a 2-hour round trip just to deposit some money. I incurred overdraft charges on my PNC account when the bills were charged. That, although slightly annoying, was okay. Then, on November 7th, WF was finally able to fix my issue (after being put on hold for close to an hour) and said they wiped my PNC account from my WF account, I will be able to newly set up a PNC account to transfer money to. Problem is, when I went to set up my PNC account again, WF once again made trial deposits to my PNC account, and withdrew the deposits, which incurred another overdraft fee on my account. I was extremely displeased with the whole process, and the extra overdraft charge was just rubbing salt in the wound. I called to have the fee refunded, to which I received a 'no,' then went to a local WF branch to have a representative there call WF headquarters for me, and help me file a complaint. Once the complaint was filed, They responded with a 'no.' Although I'm normally a pretty easy-going guy, and this started because of a small twenty-five dollar charge, their lack of accountability throughout this process has really pissed me off. This is really unacceptable, and I will be canceling my account and taking my funds to Bank of America.  ",2012-11-27

1693,Long Time Customer Seriously Fed Up!!!,11070,51,Wells Fargo Bank,10155,1,"My husband has been a customer of Wells Fargo for 25+ years.  When we got married I decided to become a  joint holder on his accounts.  I truly regret that decision now.  Over the last few years they have been pushing us to keep upgrading our accounts and to sell us new ones.  When we finally agreed to an upgrade I found out that we had been paying a monthly service fee for 3 years that we should have been waived because we met the requirements for waiving.  When I asked if all that money would be reimbursed, I would swear I could hear crickets chirping.  I gave them another chance to prove themselves.  Until recently we had an issue of having our credit card number stolen and used.  I promptly reported the issue, spent numerous days talking to 5 different people (getting different results from each one, might I add) only to be told that after their investigation they have decided not to honor our request and we are responsible for paying all of the fraudulent charges.   What I found ironic on the whole situation was that when we received new replacement credit card numbers/cards, it states right on the form ""you will not be liable for fraudulent acitivity, if promptly reported"".  They don't mean that in the least.  Some how do you do for loyal, long term customers.  Don't waste your time with this institution...unless you want to get ripped off over the years. ",2012-10-14
1694,Wells Fargo Is The Worst Bank I Could Have Ever Dreamed Working With,11044,51,Wells Fargo Bank,10125,1,"I'm a college student at The College of New Jersey.  Wells Fargo is the only bank available to me on campus, being it is the only ATM here at TCNJ where I attend.  During orientation, they had a booth offering to open up a FREE!!!! College Student card with no fees, and a minimum of only $100.  Great! I thought, what a nice bank Wells Fargo must be.  The man working the booth takes my ID, walks me thru the sign up sheet and after a short 10 minutes I was on my way to having this checking account.  Nice and simple, what could go wrong?<br/><br/>  <br/><br/> 3 weeks later, I finally receive my debit card in the mail.  On the face of the letter, there is something a little off.  My name is backwards.  The person who copied my ID to the sheet put my name as my middle name and first name switched, so my card did not have the correct name on it.  I was a little annoyed by this, but understood mistakes happen.  So, I went to a branch to get it straightened out.  The teller at the bank was very helpful, nice and pleasant.  She told me that contrary to what i was told, I was opened up for a account with a $5.95 monthly fee and no minimum.  So, pretty much, the man at the stand blatantly lied to my face when opening my account and tried to screw me with fees.  WHATEVER! It could have been worse, at least we caught it.  We open up a new savings account with a $300 minimum and no fees.  Not really what i wanted, but thats okay. I fill out the necessary forms and set my pin at the branch.  I was so happy it was all finally over.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/> Not.  After another 3 weeks, my card comes in the mail.  My name is spelt right and all!  Yesterday, I desperately needed money so I ran to the ATM on campus.  I stick it in, punch in my pin.  Denied, incorrect pin.  I try it again (I must have miss typed it!)?!  Nope.  The pin does not work.  WHY DOES THE PIN NOT WORK.  THIS MUST BE A NIGHTMARE.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/> That night, I email Wells Fargo pertaining to the PIN problem, and they respond to me saying I have to call or go into a branch in order to change my pin.  I have no car, I'm a freshman in college.  So, obviously I call the 800 number.  The women on the phone tells me that I can't change it over the phone (I think, I could barely understand a word she was saying), then continues on to tell me about a new emergency cash card that is perfect for college students who needs some cash in an emergency that I should consider signing up for.  I immediately hang up on her.  That's where I'm at now, writing this review.  I am furious.  I've never been more frustrated by a bank In my entire life.  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/> If you have the choice people, go with Chase.  Anything but Wells Fargo, save yourselves the stress and anger.  ",2012-10-11

The rude tellers, that don't do what you ask them. And, even when I left them I tried to politely tell them why I'm going else where, they told me to keep it to myself and they are not interested in why I was an unsatisfied customer.

Anything they tell you to try to get you to set up an account is very carefully devised to keep the real information from you and make you believe what they want you to believe.

They are the worst bank I have ever done business with and I have had at least one account with almost every major bank and many of the smaller regional banks. Avoid Wells Fargo at all costs.

Once this led to a misunderstanding, in that in one instance I had figured that the month was paid, but the amount was applied to the previous month leading to a $35 fee. It took a lot of finagling, but finally got them to refund the fee that should never have been applied in the first place. During that conversation, I clarified that to avoid such instances in the future, if a second ""amount"" was paid after the due date, I would be all set for the next month. Fast forward two months. Again, paid twice in one month, then paid the entire balance off. Imagine my surprise to find a $35 fee for paying one day late for the month of July. Theoretically the second payment in June should have been applied to July, given my previous conversation. So, when trying to rectify this matter, I was told that I had 'used up' my courtesy refund.

1723,Wells Fargo Needs To Change,9719,51,Wells Fargo Bank,8489,1,"I have had an account with this bank for about 11 years - that is, with Wachovia before the takeover.  Wachovia wasnt great but at least I could find people to ask and straighten out silly mistakes they made.  Then, upon takeover, all of a sudden the few competent people were fired (in our local branch) and were replaced by uneducated workers who had extremely limited English.  It was absurd.  <br/><br/> We have had both our business and personal checking accounts - and have about 7 accounts with this bank.  The only reason I have not switched is that I believe that the banking industry in general is set up to make as much money as possible for the highest ranking exec's and that this is the whole point of the existence of the banks - so we are all just completely stuck.  So much for customer service; frankly, it is simply unavailable.<br/><br/> Here is an example of a recent occurence:<br/><br/> I tried to make a deposit at an ATM at one of the 4 branches I frequent (ATM machines- convenient to my errands).  The checks would not process so I went into the bank.  After about 15 minutes the very simple issue was resolved, by a nice young lady.  However, she decided to update my ATM card.  So within the next week I received 3 different versions of ATM cards, all with serious mispellings of my name, and one of them was a VISA card, which I had specifically requested not to have.  I had to trash them all.  Then, not long afterwards, I got another one in the mail, which was a standard update, with correct spelling.  It was the oddest thing, honestly.<br/><br/> Here is another one:  Last time I ordered new checks, they got the name completely wrong so of course I had to reorder.  And whenever I have a question, I ask someone in the branch.  I am then told I must talk to a business rep. since we also have business accounts.  I then work hard to contact this person, by phone and email, and am always promised that she will get back to me.  So far she has never ever done so, by phone or email.  This has been going on at least a year and a half.  I give up!  <br/><br/> Here is another problem - prior to Oct 2011 for some reason they issued several partial month statements.  And even though for 11 years I have been asking for monthly statements (1st through last day of the month), and promised this many times, it has never happened.  Sometimes the statements are 29 days long.  Go figure?  All this costs me a significant amount of money in extra bookeeping and CPA time.  <br/><br/> Here's another problem:  Now they have converted their system and I can no longer get images of my canceled checks without manually going through each statement and making a copy of each check.  Thanks a lot - that alone will add another 90 minutes to my 2 hours a month of needless bank trouble shooting time.  <br/><br/> You should see the ignorance of the pathetic people who work in the bank.  They have no clue.  They are raw, untrained people who maybe could think if they were only taught how.  They are trained to be friendly, but there are so few things they know how to address I wonder why they are there at all.  I feel really sorry for them, but not as much as for me, a consumer.  <br/><br/> Banks make tons of money and pay out tons of large bonuses.  That is where they put the money.  We are suckers and have no recourse.",2012-06-29

1728,"Fees, Fees And More Fees!",9268,51,Wells Fargo Bank,7990,2, <br/><br/> My first bank account was with Wachovia and I never had a problem but now that Wells Fargo has taken over I’ve incurred so many ridiculous fees. I have their Way 2 Save program where they debit $1 out of your checking account everytime you use your Debit Card and put it into your savings. Great way for me to start a savings and also have overdraft protection. Well times are hard and I have been finding my checking account short a lot lately so I’ve been transfering money from my savings to my checking pretty much weekly. Everytime you transfer online it says that excessive tranfsers may incur a fee. I never really paid much attention to that because I didn’t think transferring once a week was excessive. Well Wells Fargo thinks differently then I do…..they charged me 2 fees of $15 each for transferring my money from one account to another. I called and spoke to customer service and they told me it’s federally regulated and not the banks doing! What a freakin joke!!!So in other words Wells Fargo can transfer my money from my checking to my savings several times a day or whenever I use my bank card and the government is all for it but I can’t transfer my own money when I need to without incurring a fee! Time to find a new bank!<br/><br/>  ,2012-05-24
1729,Another Former Wachovia Customer Leaving Wells Fargo,9263,51,Wells Fargo Bank,7984,1,"Let me start off by saying, I was with First Union, Wachovia and then Wells Fargo. A customer since 1992! Overall, I wasn't very bothered by the transition to Wells Fargo. There were a few things that I didn't like, but overall my experience wasn't that bad.<br/><br/> I had a business account and two personal checkings (one was used strictly for online purchases and not linked to my main checking). I had everything the way I wanted. I did 99.9% of my transactions at an ATM and loved it. I made deposits, had a receipt e-mailed to me, and I was on my way. Deposits always posted the next day and I never had issues.<br/><br/> Recently, I found out that Wells Fargo would begin charging $5 a month for each of my personal checking accounts unless I carry a $1,500 daily balance in them or have a direct deposit. I don't have direct deposit, and quite frankly I get no interest in my checking so I don't have all my money in there. This didn't sit well with me. I called Wells Fargo up numerous times because I actually WANTED to stay with them. I enjoyed the convenience of the branches in my town and I loved their ATMs. Unfortunately, they would not work wtih me so in the end I've switched away from them. I've almost canceled all my accounts and I've done it through their online messaging system on their website. Not one person has asked me why I'm cancelling or anything of this nature (I've canceled two out of three accounts). It's unreal to me how I've been treated after being with them for over 20 years. <br/><br/> It's on to bigger and better things. I will miss Wells Fargo's ATMs though!",2012-05-23

I pushed to find out why it happened in the first place.

How the hell is it overdraft protection when neither account had been overdrafted? If I wanted to spend my savings I would. Next incident is when they decided to start charging for checking I got NO notification of this change no email, no Wells Fago online alert, and no paper mail. I go to make a withdrawal one day and there is $65 in my account, from the $100 I like to keep in there (I started keeping less money in my account after the ""overdraft protection"" issue.

I called the banking line and the lady on the phone tries to get me to open a new account. Then the next person tells me well ma'am we closed you account, I of course ask why she had no answer. Finally, three people later a person (the nicest person I had geard from the entire 50min call) tells me that they closed my account do to an overdraft, but if I went to the branch and deposited my money they would reopen the account; she did not know how much I owed so she transfered me to yet another person. When I get to the guy he tells me that they closed my account because it was negative $3,45 for 30 days. I asked them well why didnt you inform me of this or why didnt you take the money from my savings that has cash? They had no answer and proceeded to tell me that I could open a different account but I would have to pay them thier money. That was not even an issue, I actually considered staying with them until I asked for my checking account information becasue I can't see my own checking account number online since I didnt make deposits into the account I only made transfers. Wells Fargo does not believe in creating statements (online statements) if you are not making bank deposits into your savings. They verified my identity and still told me they could not give me my own account info they told me i should travel to the bank 45 min away. Needless to say i did trael to the bank to close my darn account.<br/><br/> Not only do the tele-bankers have poor customer service the branch bankers did as well. They told me I would have to wait 24hrs before I could get the money from my savings. The lady told me I could either come back for it or they would mail me a check. What type of BS is that.

I should probably add that we're very careful with our personal info, passwords, and online activity... We suspect that both times it was triggered by a simple IPhone transfer from ONE WELLS FARGO ACCOUNT into ANOTHER. So it wasn't some kind of strange online purchase...<br/><br/> Also, what's interesting is that for a couple months we had an additional identity theft protection offered by WF, but provided by some other company. We didn't know until later, that it's cost us $30 a month (!), so we decided to cancel it. Right after that our savings started to dissapear again... You start to wonder if this is coincidence...<br/><br/> Very upsetting and disappointing!!<br/><br/> (1 star is for very nice people working in my local branch.... )<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  ",2012-03-01

I hope there are other ways or I will never bank here. <br/> <br/>The people who say go to a credit union are quite insane though. Credit Unions pay no taxes!!!

1753,Perhaps It's Just Me,8177,51,Wells Fargo Bank,6523,4,"I'm in the army, stationed out in Germany, and let me start off by stating to anyone who doesn't know, Wells Fargo has zero branches in this country. I already had an account, both checkings and savings, with them before coming over. I've always been a loyal person and it's because of this that I still haven't transferred over to a new bank.<br/><br/> I see a lot of people dogging on the personal customer service, and that's where I wonder if it's just me, but I can't write a review and rate this bank based on other people's experiences. What I do know is that during the issues that came up, I was able to contact them through Skype in the states and was given maximum service in order to best fix the issues.<br/><br/> First issue that came up, and this one I was very unhappy about, but part of the fault fell on me, was they unexpectedly sent my debit card into conversion as a fraud prevention technique. I was only notified of this by a letter in the mail, and I had never figured I should change my mailing address from when I lived in California as since I had switched all my statements to the online service only, there shouldn't be anything coming from them. Unfortunately, this meant that I was stuck with only ten dollars in cash and no way to access my electronic funds and had to take out a loan in order to live long enough for the replacement card to go through customs and reach me.<br/><br/> During this process, I logged near as much five hours of phone time with them, and though the issue wasn't resolved as fast as I would have liked, I understood their limitations with overseas shipping. This was also acceptable because I got to talk to actual people who knew what they were doing. So often, you try to contact someone and all you get are automated answering machines who create a helllish maze for you to waddle through to finally find a representative. Wells fargo is much easier as the option to connect to a banker is only one submenu down.<br/><br/> The second issue was that I was caught into a small phishing scheme and called the bank in order to sever the ties the merchant group had with my card. I was unaware that the only way to do that was to close my card, the one I had just received in the mail two weeks ago. She thought I knew that and closed it before I even got a chance to take a breath. I let her know my situation and all that I had gone through and she spent thirty minutes running through her supervisory chain to get hold of a top level executive. The exec quickly jumped on it and overrode the shutdown on my card, saving both me and my unit what would have disastrous headaches. Instead of waiting another two weeks for yet another card, mine will be up and running again in about a day.<br/><br/> Maybe I've just gotten lucky, but personal service has always been able to trump over the mistakes the service has run into. The problems they and I ran myself into were frustrating, but the service they provided to help get me back out of them was stellar and I would like to thank them for that.",2012-02-22

I went in one day to perform a transaction and it was recommended by a teller that I meet with a banker to discuss some options that would safeguard the large sum of funds that I had in my savings acct. It was recommended to me that I open a money market account. She opened for me a new money market account, a check and save as you go account. According to her the reason for this recommendation was that if my card was ever stolen it would better protect me. In theory everything was fine. However, a couple times since then I was hit with overdraft fees. I use my bank card for everything. My dissatisfaction came later when I tried taking out several hundred dollars from a ATM and was not able to. I then spoke with a rep and a supervisor who was not able to raise my limit not even temporarily. However, it's okay if I used my card for point of sale purchases in any amount and any amount of times. Seeing that I'm not able to access my money as I intend to then I need a better bank who will meet my spending habits with the right product. I take responsibility for not putting enough money in my new save as you go account to cover the possibilities of over withdrawals.

1773,They Do Not Really Value Their Customers,7232,51,Wells Fargo Bank,5359,1," <br/><br/> Ugh!  The process of buying (and selling) real estate is so annoying!  The underwriter for my loan wanted me to provide a letter explaining where the money deposited into my (Wells Fargo) checking account (for a down payment for a house) came from, so I had to hunt up documentation from a few months ago showing that the money had come from me liquidating my Wells Fargo managed mutual fund, since my Wells Fargo mortgage loan officer could not figure that out for themselves without me taking half a day off from work to hunt up a Wells Fargo bank statement and fax it back to my Wells Fargo mortgage loan officer about where the extra money in my Wells Fargo checking account came from. Do you understand why I am a bit frustrated at Wells Fargo right now? I am a “customer”, not a criminal, so shouldn’t they be kissing my shoes, trying to get me to take a loan, instead of going out of their way to try to annoy me? Every time that I turn around, someone else wants just another letter of explanation, another letter of reassurance, another document, another bank statement … enough already! Just because I am helping the economy by buying a house doesn’t automatically mean that I am some shady character simply because I actually have some “savings” even in the middle of a recession, on a government salary, and can afford to buy something.  <br/><br/> I realize that the mortgage bankers are skittish after the real estate bust in 2008 (which every decent economist predicted years ago), but this is ridiculous! And this is typical of how they treat former customers of Wachovia Bank (whom they acquired) and whom that I have had accounts for several years. Wells Fargo has a worse website (counter initiative and hard to read), more paperwork requirements, and tends to be less helpful and less responsive to customer requests than Wachovia ever was. <br/><br/>  ",2011-12-06

In addition, the bank changed the type of account my mother holds (obviously the woman on the phone wanted her brownie points and commission). When my mother called the bank to change the account back, the CSR said this could not be done over the phone. So Wells Fargo can change her account over the phone without permission but cannot bring the account to its original account state over the phone. She also will be closing her account.

1780,Another Decades-Long Profitable Norwest Customer Blown Off Repetitively (25% My Fault/75% Theirs),6858,51,Wells Fargo Bank,4901,1,"I was with Norwest and then WF for 12 years (credit and checking accts) and for about the first decade everything seemed fine. I'm a relatively big-fish for checking account and so it saw lots of use and not many fees. The only problem I really had was discovering 7 years on down the road, that I wasn't getting points from my debit rewards card, but they fixed it quickly, did a retroactive credit and without much BS. Mostly I appreciated the ability to move all over the country and never have to change banks. <br/><br/> However maybe 3-4 years ago something started to change with the way card transactions posted, and I started getting more overdraft charges. After the third or fourth time of seeing the same pattern of deposits and card transactions leading to severe overdrafts- I let go of the semi-automatic guilt of getting an overage notice, and started to realize that it wasn't MY behavior that had somehow gotten worse!!! And I started looking around for a new bank.<br/><br/> I first went with a large state-level commercial bank and while it felt better to be keeping my money in the state, I still felt like the debit card transactions were posting in pretty strange ways sometimes. Also this banks online system proved almost impossible for me to regularly use for a variety of reasons. So I kept looking for bank that seemed like it actually wanted my business.<br/><br/> When I finally discovered a credit union I liked, I didn't officially ""switch"" from WF, I just kept my balance really low and started mostly using my CU acct. This is what I did that was stupid. Because the auto bill from my WF CC to my checking account at WF was still active, it kept drawing down my small WF checking balance. So it got to the point where the checking was sub-$100 overdrawn, and because I wasn't paying any attention to my 12 year old unused checking account anymore, I let it go for 30 days. According to WF they ""tried"" to call me but didn't have my current phone number (did I mention the acct was 12 years old?) <br/><br/> So of course these days they don't send you a letter until its been 30 days, and apparently they also close accounts without valid phone numbers, after 30 days (instead of the normal 60)- so this resulted in my not being aware of the overage until the account was already closed and reported to chexsystems!!! And of course even though it was paid off within days of the notice, its still on chexsystems preventing my from ever opening another checking account! <br/><br/> Whats REALLY wierd, is a very similar thing then happened to my Wells Fargo CC about six month later. I kept the CC open because at that point it was the only rewards debit or credit card I had. Was making a lot of online purchases at this point and because it was during the 2011 summer CC fraud-wave, my larger online purchases kept getting frozen or rejected by WF fraud prevention. <br/><br/> Fine, I understand this is part of having a safe credit card. What got annoying was to tell people at WF over and over that I was planning on making more big onine purchases and to please keep the line open in the future. I kept telling people this and it kept accomplishing nothing. So due to all this mucking about (and one of the big transactions being refunded) there were a whole series of large pending transactions some of which stayed pending for OVER TWO WEEKS! All this without every showing the transactions in the online program, so all I had to go on, while trying to maximize use of my points card- was running balance and available credit, for several weeks. I could tell my balance wasn't really matched up with reality but because I don't keep a seperate set of books I couldn't tell how bad it had gotten.<br/><br/> So I continued to make payments about once a week and make big online purchases. Because the amounts were always less than the available credit for that day, and because the transactions were successful, I assumed things were more or less ok. Imagine my surprise to login one day and see my account was overlimit by more than 2 grand- and transactions had cleared even DAYS AFTER the card was supposedly overlimit!! I immediately made a payment to bring it back under limit, and when I login again three days later to see if the payment cleared, I discovered that yes the payment cleared and that WF had also CLOSED THE CREDIT CARD! ALL REWARDS POINTS DELETED !<br/><br/> So of course that now makes two seperate WF accts that have been closed before they even gave me a chance to fix things. I was quite surprised to learn that a CC can go from underlimit to overlimit to closed in three days on a weekend. Probably even more surprised to learn that an assisant branch manager on the phone with corporate, can spend two hours trying to help me out and get nowhere. Apparently they don't want the business of the middle class anymore.<br/><br/> The silver lining it all this was to learn a few wierd facts about the payment processors (Mastercard in this case). Again these are things the WF branch told me after this happened<br/><br/> 1- Even if you are told for 12 years you have a certain credit limit, in actuality its only theoretical and won't always stop transactions from going through above that limit.<br/><br/> 2- Payment processors have the ability to ""force"" transactions to go through, even above your limit (Under certain circumstances of course) what made my particular purchases qualify for these special circumstances clauses, they never explained real well. Because they were online buys where I hadn't recieved or shipped any products yet, you'd think cancelling the transactions would be easier and not require ""forcing"" anything. And ""wierdly enough"" thats exactly what happened with a couple of smaller purchases in that time frame- but the big ones were ALL FORCED through which is what led to the overage disaster.<br/><br/> So again I do take reponsibility for not keeping my own ledger, but for all the rest of this- especially the continued and consistent inaccuracy of the online banking product (which was ""of course"" modified within a few days of this happening to me) I do blame Wells Fargo. I also blame them for not having customer reps with authority to overide the computer algorithms, which is obviously causing the loss of profitable customers.<br/><br/> Anyways the REAL silver lining to this is now ALL my loans and accts are with, or soon to be with, credit unions. You feel better, are treated better, and with CO-OP network CUs you can go to any branch across the whole country, deposit checks etc !",2011-11-08
1781,"Salesmen, Not Bankers.",6835,51,Wells Fargo Bank,661,2,"I have banked with Wells Fargo for some time now. Over the few years I have been with them, they seem to have continually increased their advertising for this special thing and/or that. I have also seen a lot of fees added to my accounts. It is feeling more like a bunch of salesmen are holding my money. I don't know about you, but I would never give a salesmen my money for safe keeping. <br/> <br/>The worst experience I had with this was going into one of the local branches. I was asked if I wanted to pay to have them watch my credit score. I told them that I could do it myself for free, so I didn't need them to. The MANAGER of the branch came over an proceeded to argue with me. Isn't there some rule about not arguing with a customer? I was pretty upset by the end of this argument. I can even point out 3 lies he told me in the argument in hopes of swaying me. I have never gone back to that branch. The others I have been to still advertise like crazy, but haven't argued with me like that. <br/> <br/>Overall, I am annoyed with this bank. I feel like I am constantly having to watch my back to see if they are taking my money. I also feel like I need to read all of the junk mail and stuff they send me so I know what they are trying to sneak up on me with. They have pretty good online banking though.

Wachovia had built a solid reputation for quality and caring service which existed under a variety of previous banks until Wells Fargo showed up. Instead of considering the impact on customers of introducing their policies and fees, they chose to trample on the customers and do what ever they wanted. <br/> <br/>Today they don't have a low or no fee savings account or didn't last time I looked? And they like to stick you with high fees buried in fine print. <br/> <br/>Let's compare WF to your mattress. First, friendly service. Ever seen your mattress argue with you? Next, I have an awesome indication that they believe the customer comes second, and they come first. Again, the mattress always puts you first. Third, my daughter was out right lied to by a staff member over a trivial detail. I made her take her money out of there when I heard about it. Mattresses always tell the truth. <br/> <br/>Go to your local credit union or regional bank and avoid Wells Fargo, you will be happy you did, or use your mattress if that is your preference?",2011-10-21
1786,I Didn't Ask For This,6583,51,Wells Fargo Bank,4568,1,"I have had a wonderful relationship with Wachovia for nearly a decade. Recently, they were bought out by Wells Fargo. The transition just took place this week and I am already looking for a new bank.<br/><br/>First of all, WF's website for online banking is ridiculously confusing. Wachovia's website was incredibly user friendly.<br/><br/>The Droid app is absolutely useless. No one from customer service can help me get it to work, and the implication is that it's MY fault.<br/><br/>Then, I find out that Wells Fargo charges $12.50 any time they transfer money from one of my savings accounts to cover an overdraft. I know it is a bad habit, but there are times when I will make a late night purchase, knowing the money is not in my checking account but knowing it's in savings and I can make a deposit the next morning. No problem with Wachovia, but WF uses this as a way to gouge me. In other words, I get charged to use MY OWN MONEY! Wachovia did not charge for this service. <br/><br/>I called to ask about these charges and to get other information. That was a nightmare. <br/><br/>First of all, I was on hold for 15 minutes. When I finally got a human on the phone, she was the rudest, most uncaring individual I have ever encountered on a business call. She was absolutely useless. She could not help me get the Droid app to work. She scolded me like a child over the fees, and basically told me that if I didn't like the policies perhaps I should change banks. She did tell me that I could avoid the overdraft charges simply by using my Droid to transfer funds. Which would be great, if the app actually worked.<br/><br/>I have over 10 accounts with WF, with my personal and business accounts. I will be moving ALL these accounts within the week. Sadly, WF could not care less that they are losing my business.",2011-10-20

As a prior Wachovia customer we were instructed to sign on to our new Wells Fargo online account access, and verify that all scheduled transfers and scheduled bill payments were transferred from Wachovia successfully. I did exactly that and saw that the bill payment scheduled for that Monday was missing, however, all other bill payments and histories were present. According to the Wells Fargo instructions, I rescheduled the missing payment. Two days later the payment was debited from my account, twice!! Leaving me with no savings, thanks to overdraft protection, and overdrawn by over $500. When I contacted customer service I was informed that although the second payment was indeed not showing because they were not done entering all assimilated account transactions, the overdraft fees would be refunded subject to computer approval for eligibility and that the $1500 payment would be refunded subject to the dispute resolution departments turn around of 7 to 10 days!!!

There's no way in hell I can have $1500 + $500 Direct Deposit and expect that large amount of money to just sit on my account unused. I could do so much with $1500 including paying bills/debt, rent an apartment, buy food, entertainment, etc. Why would I bother to let WF sit with that large amount of money just to save me nearly $10 on fees? It's ridiculous.<br/><br/> I loved WF and they've served me well in the past couple years I've been with them. But they're better off for the rich/wealthy people like those living in Hollywood or Beverly Hills.

At the end of the conversation the man asked if he resolved the reason for my call even though he told me I didn't qualify for a reversal of my overdraft fee.  Hell no you didn't resolve S***!<br/><br/> To summarize Wells Fargo is a PIECE OF S***!!  And a bunch of thieves.  Stop taking my damn money.<br/><br/> Go to a credit union immediately.",2011-08-30
1796,12 Year Customer Has Enough,5982,51,Wells Fargo Bank,3722,1,"I opened my account with Wells Fargo in Jan 1999, although it may still have been NorWest then. It was free checking, then they started charging for the cancelled checks sent with the statements. I finally got tired of paying that, and just got copies. Then I opted for online statements only. I hadn't really  had too many problems with them, other than a lack of common sense in their lobbies - I got so tired of waiting in line to deposit my check (my employer did not have direct deposit), while morons got up there and said, ""Do you have a pen?"" and proceeded to waste 20 minutes filling out their stuff that should have already been filled out - they have several places to do it BEFORE you get up there. I went off on one of the tellers about it one time and they finally put a sign up to have your stuff ready by the time you get to the teller. But then I got direct deposit and didn't have to deal with it.  I did notice that they changed tellers quite frequently. So a year or so ago I got a check from Paypal for $149.94. I filled out my deposit slip (correctly) and went through the drive thru. I didn't look at my receipt until a couple of days later - they had deposited the check as $194.49. So I went online to see if they had corrected it (you would think they would not have balanced at the end of the day), but nope. So I emailed them to make the correction and that if Paypal gave me any trouble, they were in for it. About a week later I received a letter in the mail acting as though THEY had caught the error, and is if it were MY fault, not theirs, and they had taken the trouble to correct it. Nowhere did they say sorry, or thanks for notifiying us. But...I let it go.<br/><br/> Then I get an important notice - Effective Sept 12, my ""free checking"" is no more. I will have to keep $1500 at all times (so that WELLS FARGO can have access to and play with MY money - but I can't), OR, I will have to have at least one $500 direct deposit per ""billing cycle."" Since I only get paid once per month, and it may be on the 24th, 25th, or 26th - or who knows, maybe on the 23rd, 27th or 28th - I'm sure they could finagle that so that I would miss their ""billing cycle"" and I would get a charge - supposedly $7.00 but they will reduce it by $2.00 if I set up ""online statements for this account."" Which apparently they didn't notice I ALREADY HAVE.<br/><br/> Then, a couple of weeks ago, I went to get some cash out of the ATM drive thru. However, there were 5 cars ahead of me and I thought it would be quicker to write a check and go through the regular lanes. I put my check and my card in, (still 5 cars at the ATM), and wait. And wait. And wait. Finally they send the check back and tell me that I have to endorse the back of my own check, so that THEY can then endorse it. Whatever. So, I remember I have an $11.00 check from ebates and go ahead and deposit that. And I wait. and wait. and wait. Meanwhile, the 5 cars at the ATM are long gone. People are coming and going while I sit there. Strangely,  no one EVER gets in line behind ME. The girl on the monitor tells me it will be ""just a moment"" but they are waiting on other people, NOT ME. I get on the speaker and ask ""How long is just a moment?"" I've been sitting there 25 MINUTES. She then tells me that she had trouble ""scanning"" my check but she has called her supervisor and it should be ""just a moment."" I tell her that is ridiculous and she should have informed me of this a lot earlier. She doesn't care, says the supervisor is there and she will have my stuff out to me. 5 minutes more - I'm about to go inside the bank and cuss them out - she does not come on the monitor and say thanks or anything - she send my cash and my deposit slip - but NOT my ATM card. I'm sitting there looking at my cash and dep slip, and I press the button. Another girl comes on and says, ""I have your cash right here!"" What? I have my cash in my hand. I tell her I need MY CARD.  I have to to send the plastic case back and WAIT again. NEVER AGAIN WELLS FARGO.

They asked me to drive back to the branch (15 miles away from my house) to pick up the coins and that my account would be debited. Mistakes happen and I was not upset at the teller for making a mistake. What I can not understand is that the branch manager did not have the autonomy to make a decision based on customer service. I work in a customer service environment and if any of my employees or myself made a $6 mistake I would write it off in a second. It is insulting to call a customer and ask them to drive 15 miles for a small mistake that was made by your company! I don't care about the $6.

1806,13 Year Customer Told To Take A Hike,5271,51,Wells Fargo Bank,3094,1, <br/><br/> Been using Wells Fargo for thirteen years and never had a problem. But today when I made a deposit I was told at the drive through that starting in September all their accounts are required to have a daily $1500 minimum balance. Great service and friendly reps when you have a problem but I guess this bank is just for the better-offs now. The average Joe that lives pay check to pay check should look elsewhere. I'm closing my personal and business account next week once I find another bank. I've been using them for 13 years and my family has for three generations. I guess that don't mean anything in this day and age anymore.,2011-07-08

Since they're paying us zilch to use our money, the least they can do is be nice to us. Well, I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the customer service at Wells' branch in downtown Oakland (CA) off 20th Street and Webster (near the Kaiser Building and Alliant Credit Union's office).<br/><br/> Cheapskate that I am, I wanted to park in Wells' free lot (a rarity in Oakland, might I add) while I deposited a check at Wells and then leave the car there while I went across the street to Alliant, to do a deposit. I fully expected to get the full ""fuhgettaboutit"" moment, since the signs in the lot were quite succinct, limiting parkers while on Wells' business only.<br/><br/> OMG, totally shocked. Not only were the folks in the branch (including the parking attendant) nice as could be, I almost thought I was back in the ""free toaster"" days of yore. I made my deposit at Wells, then Alliant, no problems, no moving of the car.<br/><br/> After all the negative posts about big retail banks, I had to share.<br/><br/> Bozo",2011-06-30

They Treat Customers Based On Their Balance!,5075,51,Wells Fargo Bank,2983,1,"Their tellers are always nice and friendly, and branches are clean and organized; however, the bankers and managers treat customers based on their balance.<br/><br/> Well Fargo was my favorite bank, and only one, when my balance was above $100,000. When I had some financial problems, downgraded my account to save monthly charges, and my bank account was leess than $1000, they started to treat me defirrently.

Then I went and bought some shoes. Then I went to a movie. I thought I had enough for all my purchases. When I checked my account the next day I saw I had over drafted by a 1$. So I went and deposited to get my account back to the plus. Then the next day I was charged with not one but two overdraft fees. I tried to talk to the bank about this and ask why this happened. Apparently they charged my card first with the big purchases not the order that I actually purchased the items. I told the bank teller that this not right. She then was rude with me.

Now I have to have the home owner take time out of their busy day and drive across town just to get a signature on this check.  I think wells fargo should reconsider their policies on insurance checks.  All they are doing is making home owners and contractors lives more difficult.  Wells fargo is not a good bank.  If the check is made out to my company there is no reason that I should not be able to get it endorsed.  I did not like the fact that wells fargo could do NOTHING to help me.  ",2011-06-06

I figured it would be difficult to speak to the representative who originally consulted with me about the loan, but I was able to talk to him directly and get the change clarified. The bank also compensated me for the service I never used and unsubscribed me without any hassle. I was so glad I was not pressured to continue to pay for the service; it was removed without too much trouble and the rep. apologized.

Now that I think about it, it took over three weeks to open the CD with them five years ago and they kept saying they never got the funds yet, wonder if it's their policy to hold onto customer money as long as they can before opening and closing CD's. Maybe I need to contact the banking regulators about this and see what they say. On the positive side, I've always been happy with their rates and also their customer service folks but this delay is simply unacceptable, it will cost me a $25 overnight fee on the replacement check plus three weeks lost interest and a reduction in the rates since they are heading down right now.

1842,Subpar Compared To Other Online Banks,36511,10480,Synchrony Bank,56356,2,"I recently opened 3 online CD accounts with 3 different banks. I've had good experiences so far with Barclays, and Citizens Access. Syncrhony however has been a headache. (1) They posted funds to the CD two business days later than the other 2 banks, even though all banks ACH cleared my funding account source on the same day. (2) They mailed (USPS) a ""welcome kit"" to my home address, even though I indicated I wanted electronic communications only (3) they notified me electronically, a day after I received the paper documents in the mail, that they hadn't yet received my signed signature cards for the account and that immediate action was required. I have not received a request to provide signed signature cards yet from the other two banks. If anyone has been a victim of ID theft in the past, I'm sure you can appreciate why I did not want documents with my name, address and <br/>SSN mailed to me via USPS . When I contacted Synchrony with my concerns about receiving paper documents, I was told to go online and change the settings from paper to online. So, I went online, and saw that the setting for the CD account was already set at online (not paper). A checkbox on their webpage asks to acknowledge that you are able to read and receive electronic documents. I checked the box and clicked the submit button. An error message came back on the webpage which made absolutely no sense. I wish I had chosen another online bank. I will watch the statement at the end of the month to make sure they correctly calculate the interest and that the interest earning period is as of the date of funding (which again was two full business days after the other two banks showed that the respective CD accounts had been funded).",2019-02-26

I looked all over the web site but couldn't find a way to change it. I was able to change the phone number in my profile, no problem. I called them and they said a 3rd party handles that and I would have to call equifax to change it there. They gave me a number that was equifax, but the wrong number. Once I got the correct equifax number, I had to go through a complete verification which was fine, but time consuming only to be told that they don't store phone numbers unless there is a fraud alert on my record and there wasn't a fraud alert and there were no phone numbers associated with my equifax credit record. <br/><br/>Bottom line, I'd like to have the correct number associated with my synchrony account, but it doesn't seem possible at this point!",2019-02-18

Since I am not using it for anything outside accruing interest rate, I didn't try to access account regularly. Recently due to favorable interest interest rates I decided to open another account on weekend and discovered that their website doesn't handle online opening of the account outside of regular business hours. I tried several times for me and my husband (at least 3 or 4 attempts, then I did it in the evening hours, the same result). Then I got very concerned and try simply access the existed account and always receive error message about technical difficulties). I finally called them and asked to cancel the application and mentioned that I have problems to access the existed account. They were sympathetic but that's the extend. So, to summarize you have an Internet bank with genuinely competitive rates (at least on January 2019), where you can not access your own savings and if you try to increase the amounts that you deposit, you can do it with better results by using their automated phone service.",2019-01-08

My tenant gave me a check for the rent of the home she rents from me. I deposited the check and three days after I deposited it my tenant called to tell me that her payroll was deposited short and the check she gave me may bounce. By then I had already transferred the money out of the Synchrony bank account into a new account I had opened. I was notified that the check bounced about a week later. As soon as I was notified I went online to transfer money back into Synchrony and my account was blocked with a message that I had to call them. I called them right away and was asked a series of questions about the check. I explained what happened and they told me my account was under fraud investigation ""for my protection"" and that it would take a few days to conclude. I hung up thinking everything would be straightened out in 3-4 days. I called again the following week and told them that my account was still blocked and I couldn't deposit the replacement funds into the account. I was then told that they now had to put in a request to another department to unblock and that would take another 3-4 days. That same afternoon I received a voice mail from Synchrony asking me when I planned on replacing the funds. I called them right back and they told me that they didn't have any record of anyone calling me. Another week went by during which I received a letter in the mail and a message to my online inbox threatening that they were going to report me to the credit bureaus unless I replaced the funds within the next 30 days. I called them again, now for the 4th time and explained to a supervisor everything that had happened the previous 3 weeks. She told me that I could replace the funds by mailing them a check and I explained that I didn't have checks that I did all my banking through transfer with the other bank the same way Synchrony encouraged me to do it with them. We are now going on 45 days and 5 phone calls from me to them and today they are still telling me that it will take another 4-5 days and that the problem is that the fraud department had not been able to get a hold of me.

Then it occurred to me that I might have used an incorrect e-mail address. During conversation with telephone rep to verify above, I was informed that not only were my accounts approved, but that a total of six accounts were actually opened. Did it not materialize to these incompetents the question of why a new customer would open multiple identical accounts? Why wasn't I alerted of this? A simple telephone call would've sufficed. Further, Synchrony was unable to complete electronic transaction from my common money market account to fund the two accounts in question. Rep then stated he would close all accounts but the two above, and that I would see the information online within hours. Did not happen. I called the service number again. Another rep verified the account closures, and provided the two remaining account numbers so I could initiate funds transfer from my money market account. Then today, I received several e-mails stating that the accounts which were previously verified as open were closed. Called the service number (again). Hit the same automated number options. This time, I was transferred to the ""IRA Department"" by some gentlemen who sounded like he did not care to be on the phone.

I was a customer of Wells Fargo for the last ten years and I hate the customer service and the savings account gives me almost nothing back in return. I opened my Synchrony Bank because the interest rate I got on my savings was 1.5%. By comparison the account I had with Wells Fargo had a .22% APY. It may not seem like a big difference but that one percent increase made depositing money into my savings more attractive and actually led to me saving more. The biggest thing I did not like about using Synchrony Bank is that there is no physical location I can go to. I am able to use a lot of ATM's without a fee but it would be nice to have an actual store to go into and talk to a banker. While I have never had any issue getting a hold of a Synchrony Banker over the phone or via chat, I miss having a face to face interaction to answer my more difficult questions about my savings account.

1858,Had A Really Fine Experience With Synchrony.,33909,10480,Synchrony Bank,47762,5,"I just had a 1 year CD for 100K mature at 12:01AM on May 15, and today on May the 16th the funds are showing up as posted and available in another bank that I had verbally requested Synchrony to transfer those funds to. During the time that I had opened the CD a year ago, as well as the time last week that I called them to request the transfer, the phone was always answered fast, the reps were courteous, and the funds transferred without a hitch. The only reason I have left Syncrony Bank is because I now prefer to leave my funds instantly available to me in online savings instead of a CD. While Synchrony has very high CD rates, they are a little bit less competitive with their savings account interest rates..... which does make a difference when you have a large sum of cash involved. But, if I wanted to renew into a CD again, I'd have gladly stayed with Syncrony bank and can highly recommend them. <br/><br/>I will submit the following info about cashing out of a maturing CD with them so the process goes as smooth for you as it did for me; Make sure you have another bank already on file with Synchrony that you want the funds transferred to. About 11 months in, at a month in advance of the date of the CD maturity, Synchrony will post a daily reminder in your account page asking you what you want to do with the maturing CD. With that reminder, you can click and indicate your preference and renew the CD, or you can transfer the cash to another bank by ACH that you have on file with them. However, I chose to call them up and verbally dictate to them that I wanted the account to be closed, and the last penny of interest due me to be transferred. If you don't call them up to make this request, but use the website to do the transfer instead, then what will happen is that you will only get the 11 months of interest that is shown on your current balance.... and the account will later reflect the final 12th month of interest after you had already transferred out the 11 month interest balance. Being I intended on closing my account and I didn't want any lingering interest showing up later, I called them to request the account stay open until all 100% of the interest is showing on my account, and then transfer the full amount and close the account. There was absolutely no problems whatsoever, and they were a pleasure to deal with.",2018-05-16

1860,Will NEVER Do Business With This Bank Again,33731,10480,Synchrony Bank,50529,1,"Can't begin to list all the problems with this bank. I opened several CDs with them years ago, when their rates were higher than average. Since then, they've proven themselves to be so incompetent that I can only conclude upper management does not care at all. On one occasion a CD came due, and I requested the funds be sent to me through an ACH transfer. After two days the funds had not been put through; I call and stay on hold for 20 minutes before speaking to someone who tells me it takes up to 4 days. That's legally permitted, but every other bank I've worked with (and I do this often) takes 24 hours or, occasionally, 48. Synchrony always takes the full 96 hours. However, on this occasion they hadn't put the transfer through -- they'd sent a check via regular mail, sent bulk rate. It took a week before I got someone on the phone who admitted as much. So I had to wait three weeks for it, but even then it never arrived; they claimed it must have gotten lost. Then they said it takes two more weeks to file a ""lost check"" claim. All in all, it took TWO MONTHS for me to get my money -- all of which time it was sitting in Synchrony's float account, where they were earning interest on it. I filed a complaint with the BBB, and their response was a pack of lies. On numerous other occasions I've had other problems with Synchrony. Pretty much every time a CD comes due, they have one reason or another why it takes an extra week or two before they return my money to me. I contacted a lawyer about it, who read the application and showed me the small print where it says the customer waives the right to be part of any class-action lawsuit against Synchrony. Pretty smart of them to put that in there, since they knew they'd get sued. Criminal company you should absolutely avoid.",2018-05-09

They have great rates and FDIC insurance, so why not put more money in your pocket? Their customer service team has always been very helpful and the chat feature on the website works great.

Why tie up my money in a CD when I can keep it in a savings account and still get a decent rate of return? It was very quick and easy to set up an account with Synchrony and transfer funds. The only issue I had was that the online setup automatically gave my father's phone number as mine (he also banks with Synchrony, and we have the same name). I'm not sure why this happened, since we obviously have different dates of birth, social security numbers, etc. I haven't had any other issues, and I'm very satisfied with the interest rate.

At first I was reluctant because I had never banked with an online bank but after chatting with the customer service representative and reading reviews online, I was ready to take the plunge. They offer the best CD rates around with FDIC insurance. For example, Synchrony offered a one-year CD with a rate of 2.15 percent (APY) which is well above the rate offered by most banks and credit unions. On the Synchrony web site, you can easily compare how much you would earn in interest at various financial institutions and the results speak for themselves. A one year CD at Chase, for example, only carried an interest rate of 0.05 percent, meaning that after one year you would earn $2,150 on a $100,000 CD at Synchrony vs. only $50 at Chase - a difference of $2,100.",2018-04-30

I had planned to use this account for a portion of my son's college savings and liked the idea of having quick access via the ATM in an emergency.<br/><br/>I have existing accounts with both brick and mortar credit unions and banks and with an internet bank. I have a credit freeze in place with all three credit bureaus. I knew the credit freeze would be a minor hassle but I've been through this before. I did my research and saw many posts that Syncrony did not do Hard checks for deposit accounts. Based on that I expected to have to have a phone conversation with them and answer some verification questions but not a big deal. <br/><br/>So I submitted the online application, waited 3 business days and when I had not heard from them (other than an email acknowledging the application was submitted), I called.<br/><br/>1st call - they found the application, verified last four of social, put me on hold while they checked with account review. Not bad, just a few minutes on hold. Came back, credit freeze was the hold up but they could not transfer me because the phone I was calling on was not in my report... huh? I was on my cell phone and you don't have access to my report, it's in a freeze. Put me on hold again and call was disconnected.<br/><br/>2nd call - called back, found app, verified last four of social, put me on hold. Came back, I need to call back from the phone I used to put the freeze on my credit with... huh? I did that several years ago, I have had several cell phone with different numbers (which I don't have anymore). Maybe it was my land line (I'm not near that during the day). I likely did the freeze online, do they mean the phone I entered in a form? She didn't really know. Asked for a supervisor, waited many minutes on the phone and hung up.<br/><br/>3rd call - immediately called back and asked for supervisor. Repeated social verification and all, put on hold. Eventually (maybe 5-7 minutes of hold), Supervisor came on. Gave her info on previous calls, put on hold. She came back and repeated the problem but with a few more details. They needed me to call back from the phone I entered in the freeze application. Or I could unfreeze the credit (that would require paying the credit bureaus a fee). Or I could update the phone number with the credit bureaus - I think that would involve cancelling the freeze and setting up a new freeze, I don't know if you can update the phone number as a unique action and I don't feel like trying to find out how.<br/><br/>So I'm done with Syncrony Bank - wasted my time and energy. I went though this last week with a different internet bank that didn't have an ATM card on the saving account - but fine, they have a good rate too, I'll go with them (Ally Bank, I'm very happy with them).

1870,Synchrony Bank - Competitive Rates but Not the Online Experience I Expect,32725,10480,Synchrony Bank,49508,3,"Last month, I decided to open a high-yield savings (HYS) account with Synchrony Bank. I had read about Synchrony Bank in a blog post about ways to earn a passive income. Synchrony's HYS rates were extremely competitive, much higher than the rate my other bank offers on a Money Market account (.20%). It was relatively easy to open an account. I completed an online application with all of the typical identifying information you would need to open a bank account and was approved quickly. Synchrony is an online bank only, so the easiest way to deposit money was to set up an electronic transfer with my primary checking account. To do this, Synchrony makes two small deposits to your account. You have to watch for these deposits and verify the amounts with Synchrony to prove that you really are the owner of the account. This process only took about 24 hours. With a HYS account, you can make as many deposits as you need (these do not count as transactions), but you are limited to 6 transactions a month. This means that you can not transfer money out of the account via EFT or withdraw using an ATM card more than 6 times a month. This wasn't problematic for me and I appreciated that the ATM option was available, as this was not offered in some of the other HYS accounts that other online banks offer. My biggest issue with the Synchrony account is the length of time it takes for them to process a transfer to another account. It can take several business days for them to process a transfer of money out of your HYS account. If you need your money fast, you either have to use the ATM card or wait. I never used the card, but I imagine there is a limit to how much you can withdraw at one time. The idea that my money wouldn't immediately be available if I needed it was a concern for me. Another downside of Synchrony is their web-interface and the lack of a mobile app. The website is very simplistic. You can basically view your money and make transfers. The lack of a mobile app means you can't take photos of checks and deposit them. Ultimately, I chose to close the account. While I would certainly earn more interest, the lack of immediate access to my money and the lack of a mobile app made feel uneasy. The customer service rep I spoke to over the phone to close my account was very helpful and pleasant. No complaints there.",2018-04-12
1871,No complaints over 5 years,32719,10480,Synchrony Bank,49502,5,"I've had multiple accounts with Synchrony Bank over the last five or so years. In that time, I've had generally no major complaints and have held multiple types of accounts with them. They've been very good at communicating with me various aspects of their accounts and have done wonderfully in solving any issues I've come across. My only real concern that I've had just a handful of times is the down time of their website. Over five years, I could count on one hand where I've had issues logging in or maneuvering through the site due to maintenance issues, and each of those times was in the middle of the day. I would assume that it would be best to be done outside of normal business hours as to not impede on the customer's daily activities",2018-04-12
1872,CD rates,32712,10480,Synchrony Bank,49495,4,"Synchrony Bank has been great for CDs. GO to your local bank or credit union and see the 0.05% that they offer on checking. Realize that's only a NICKEL on your deposit on $100, when their 2.5% CD is $2.50 on that same $100. Amazing. <br/>I read a lot on making and saving money on the internet. The bank and its CD rates were attractive. Couple that with the super simple and fast web interface, great rate, and it is a no brainer. They have an app for those who want it for banking but I do that locally at my credit union. This is more a deposit and forget it. Emails come to you when the deposit posts. I have been using them for three years. Deposits were always timely and chat feature is helpful if you have a question, but I am just there for the CD's and have only asked a question once. <br/> <br/>If you have the cash to spare they have a simple interface and make it easy to keep rolling them over into more.",2018-04-11
1873,Good bank for online needs,32706,10480,Synchrony Bank,49489,3,"Synchrony Bank provided a pretty decent experience when it came to setting up an online CD. It was a bit difficult to get started simply because of a $2,000 minimum that was required to open the account. The terms were pretty good and I was able to get a pretty good interest rate for a short-term savings plan. The only reason I closed the account was due to some unexpected medical expenses and it became necessary to withdraw the funds. I was close to the maturation date (I chose the 12 month CD) and was able to close out the account and get my money with at first some online help via a chat and then a followup phone call to ensure everything was in order. Once I get back to savings mode, I will return to Synchrony Bank to get another CD. I will next be looking at setting up an IRA. I have already done the cursory work via online chat and most of my questions were quickly answered.",2018-04-10

While hold times weren't too long, I could tell that they really push people to use the online chat feature and I did not like the automated system on the phone. The website is easy to use and the rates a fairly competitive, but if it is important to you I would not recommend. When my 12 month CD was up for renewal I wanted to get my money out of it, but it was extremely difficult for me to figure out how to do it.

What I like about Synchrony Bank is that I'm able to do all of my banking online, even opening a new savings account. I have a regular savings account and a money market account. I think the interest rates are pretty good and there was no minimum balance to open an account. I deposit money into my savings and from there I'll use an ATM to withdraw money that I will spend. The rest stays in the account earning interest. I prefer to bank this way instead of using debit or credit cards. I've used the online chat before on their website and someone was available right away to answer my questions about one of my accounts.

I have contacted customer support easily through an online chat though and was connected fairly quickly. They were extremely kind and understanding and waived our late fees with no problem at all! They have done this two times for us now! So overall I think they are an amazing bank aside from the late fee charges.

I had approximately $5,000 going into a 60 Month CD with a rate about 2% APY. I was very impressed with the rates but I also was very impressed with the Customer Service that I received while working through this search.

Transfer times should be decreasing not increasing. Their app is terrible as far as check deposits go. Would like to have check access for the Optimizier+.

I earn pennies a month from my brick-and-mortar bank (TDBank)so when I calculated that if I deposited a reasonable amount of money into Synchrony Bank I would get a substantially higher of monthly interest. I was a little apprehensive about depositing into an online bank since I had never done it before, but after reading about Synchrony on online sites, I decided to open an account with Synchrony. I quickly connected my brick-and-mortar (TDBANK) to my new Synchrony account. I was so pleased when my first month and I earned almost $20 in interest alone.

The account had to have a higher than average interest rate amount for savings accounts for me to be interested, and this one did (at either 1.1 or 1.2, when the average was less than 1 at the time). Creating the account was fairly easy; I had actually begun with another online bank, but due to that bank's unfriendly customer service, they lost me as a customer before we even got started. After that issue, I was slightly hesitant reaching out to Synchrony Bank, but they treated me just fine, and their starting process was slightly more streamlined than the initial bank. Before I knew it, my initial deposit had gone through and was earning interest, and I've been adding to it ever since.

Prior to opening the account I researched the bank and thoroughly reviewed product offerings. I found the information and marketing to be consistent with on-line reviews of their products and customer service. Opening the account was a bit frustrating and I found the customer service response at this point to be lacking as the information I was given was not complete. Rather than reconnecting, I figured it out through trial and error.<br/> <br/>The interface with the website, after setting up my account, has been great. It is intuitive and the steps are logical and clearly explained. Accessing statements and tracking current activity is simple and the information is in real time. I frequently transfer funds to and from this account. The process of setting up other institutions to send/receive funds was straight forward and available to me the first business day following setup. Transferring funds is a simple process. The information regarding projected length of time for funds to move in and out of accounts is clear. I frequently find that funds are transferred/available more quickly than stated in the guidelines. Email notifications of activity are quick and thorough.<br/> <br/>The initial interest rate offered by Synchrony Bank included a time limited incentive which was accurately applied. Since opening the account, the APY has increased 3 times, and remains the highest I have found when researching rates. I have not encountered any fees associated with this account. End of the year tax documents were made available in a timely fashion. Marketing from Synchrony regarding adding other banking products has been minimal.",2018-03-03

If there are no issues at that time, I plan to open another CD with Synchrony. <br/>Initially, I was concerned about having an online only account. There are no Synchrony branches that I walk into if there is an issue. Had I not known someone who had an account with them, I don't know that I would have opened the account.

The customer service rep said they did, which was not true. I told her that I was not going to do business with an organization that obfuscates the truth. The main thing you want in a bank is trust.

The online platform was very bland and gray but thats probably not that important although I think it is important to have an interactive interface for customers and users. No competitive products are really offered.,2018-01-30
1909,Fairly Good,31372,10480,Synchrony Bank,47386,4,"My experience with this bank has been fairly good. The bank is an online bank only. This allows for unfettered access to my account both savings and CD. The rate is competitive. The customer service is somewhat of a problem. There appears to be turnover in staff and there appears to be a high incidence of searching for my answers as opposed to having them internalized. This sometimes leads me to feeling uncertian that my needs are being addressed appropriately, But this is offset by the rate of return on my investment.",2018-01-27
1910,Absurd Rules And Procedures,31650,10480,Synchrony Bank,47641,1,"I have many online banks and Synchrony wins the prize in poor performance.<br/><br/>Firstly, unless you allow Synchrony to have a permanent ""cookie"" on your device -- you cannot log into your bank account without problems.<br/><br/>Synchrony authenticates your identity by use of a published telephone number within the credit bureaus database. That's right; Synchrony refuses to use the telephone provided when the account is established. Instead; they seek to authenticate with a credit bureau published number. My mobile number is unlisted and private.<br/><br/>Where other online banks simply call or send a text message to the telephone number you registered with them when opening the account...Synchrony checks the ""public database"" to see if your number matches your identity and does this each time you try to check your account from an unknown device or a device where you deleted their ""cookie"".<br/><br/>I attempted to resolve this matter five times with a bank supervisor over a period of five months. Each time required a 25 minute telephone call before my access could be reset in order to gain access to my bank accounts.<br/><br/>Accordingly, I took the early termination fees on 3 CD's rather than deal with Synchrony nonsense.<br/><br/>If you don't want cookies on your machine, have a private telephone number and need monthly access to your account. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK! There are other banks such as Marcus and Chase that offer the best customer service matched with efficient technology.",2018-01-26
1911,Synchrony Bank Review,31325,10480,Synchrony Bank,47316,4,"I have banked with Synchrony Bank in the past, specifically using their CDs. I liked their CD because the return rate was decent (I think it was 2.5% at the time) for a short period of 12 months. I liked that I could pull it out after 12 months instead of waiting a longer time. I also liked that my money felt more secure there than the stock market. They did have a minimum to open, I believe it was $2500. I made a decent amount in a year and had no problems pulling my money out when I wanted to. I didn't have much contact with them because it was basically just opening the CD and then closing it. I didn't have any issues while my money stayed in there and I made the promised return. I would probably use them again if I wanted to make some secure money in the future. Right now I'm being a little riskier and trying to make a higher rate of return. Their customer service when I opened the account was decent - the typical questions on the application. I didn't have to ask any questions because I've done stuff like this before with out banking institutions.",2018-01-23
1912,What I Needed,31096,10480,Synchrony Bank,46751,4,Synchrony is a great online bank for savings. They have a great rate and compare well to other online banks and blow away any local banks I've checked. What I really like is the online experience. Their website is easy to navigate and the information I want is easily found. Their app is amazing! I use it almost every day to keep up with my savings account. I've only had to contact customer service once but the experience was fine.,2018-01-17
1913,Great bank. Great interest rates!,31075,10480,Synchrony Bank,46729,5,"I bank at Synchrony Bank currently and have their CD products. The customer service has been superb in helping me set up the account and using the online banking to check what I earn monthly in interest. I have 3 CDs with the bank and their rates are much higher than their competitors. With great customer service and excellent rates, I find that Synchrony bank is a wonderful place to bank at. I plan to open more CDs there in the future as their rates always meet my expectations. Their customer service is always available to answer any questions you might have. I have recommended this bank to my friends they have opened accounts there as well and are very happy they opened accounts at Synchrony Bank.",2018-01-15
1914,Synchrony review,31045,10480,Synchrony Bank,46695,4,"I haven't banked with this institution for very long (maybe just a couple of years), but it is by far the best bank that I have had. Their customer service is like no other. I have had a few experiences where my account was broken into and they were quick to help out and getting my money refunded to me, including charges that were accrued. I had so many questions in regards to that and they were so pleasant to work with, both in person and on the phone! I am still unsure is to how I feel about the overall web or mobile banking, but maybe that is because I was taught that you want to keep those close relationships in person. The fees are just like any other bank, but they do help out though if you are a great customer and haven't had many problems in the past. Overall, I would give this bank a 4 out of 5 stars. As far as other products, I am sure they are equally as good, but I have only been interested in their savings account.",2018-01-12
1915,Great savings opportunity.,31004,10480,Synchrony Bank,46654,4,"This bank offers very competitive products. The interest rates in particular are far above the average for online savings accounts. There are no hidden fees at all. I have not had any experience with their customer service, so I cannot comment on how good their customer service department is. However, I have been a customer of this bank for over 5 years and have never had one single problem. Overall I would recommend this bank to anyone that is looking for an online savings account. The interest rate is 1.30% which is among the highest yield currently offered among any online savings accounts available. That combined with the absolute lack of fees makes opening an account with Synchrony Bank absolutely worth it. Join today!",2018-01-08

If I have any questions they are quick to answer them or they will talk to someone else to help with my problem. Yes, sometimes they can have charges I'm not happy with, but most banks and credit unions seem to have the same charges. They have a great rate for their savings account that makes up for the fees. Overall, I would recommend them.",2018-01-07
1917,Review of Synchrony Bank,30973,10480,Synchrony Bank,46609,4,"Synchrony bank is an online bank which allows for a much better interest rate on savings accounts than your typical brick and mortar bank. Their website is easy to navigate and easy to transfer money to your local banks checking account. Most checks are easily deposited into your Synchrony account by taking pictures of the front and back of the checks with your phone/tablet. The only problem I have experienced is depositing checks that were from states/government institutions (e.g. State of Florida and State of Ohio) which might be a problem if you are a government employee. Synchrony uses 2-step verification if you forget your password. The only time I have dealt with their customer service was when I had changed my cell phone number and could not appropriately 2-step verify. The customer service agent was friendly and helped solve the problem. Overall, Synchrony bank has exceeded my expectations.",2018-01-05
1918,It is convenient,30941,10480,Synchrony Bank,46481,3,"Easy to deal with, and minimal paperwork compared to some of the other institutions. The rates are competitive, and the people are friendly. For me, the paperwork was the item that is most memorable. While there are certain pages that have to be signed/done with any account, they really do try to consolidate, and make it quicker and easier than some of the others that require signature, then signature of the signature, then endorsement of the signature, then notarized signature of authorization of the signature, etc...",2018-01-03
1919,Great experience overall,30923,10480,Synchrony Bank,46463,2,"I been with Synchrony since last May and I have been very pleased. That offered me a lot better interest rate on my saving than my local bank did. Because of this I switch and put my emergency savings into there bank. Overall, I couldn't be happier. I get my statements on time and I don't have to pay any fees with is a big positive. I would definitely recommend Synchrony to anyone looks for a great online bank. They are definitely worry free.

1920,"Synchrony Bank-No complaints, high interest rate",30915,10480,Synchrony Bank,46455,4,"I was looking for a bank/credit union with a high interest rate to keep my savings in. I didn't want nonsense fees, and wanted my savings to compound. Several listicle websites listed synchrony on it, these lists usually were about best interest rates & convenience. Based on my location and qualifications, Synchrony fit best for me. I don't need to set up recurring deposit, no monthly/annual fees, no other stipulations, just a high interest rate. Customer service isn't very important to me since I'd prefer to figure things out myself online - I haven't had any serious problems anyway so I haven't tested out their customer service, the worst thing to happen is that sometimes I'm trying to make transfers and I'll get an error message, but all I have to do is try again later and it works fine. The transfers take longer than I'd like but I think it would take the same time for any bank. I believe my interest rate is 1.15, and with that I'm able to get about 8-9 dollars per month in interest accumulated. Motivates me to keep adding to it.",2017-12-30
1921,Good job but limited options,30879,10480,Synchrony Bank,46418,3,"Overall I was satisfied with my time at Synchrony Bank. They are the providers of the PayPal rewards card so I didn't have much of a choice of opening up an account with them if I needed the card. Overall, rates were reasonable and customer service was good, but never impressive (though nothing was done negatively as well). I lost my banking card a couple times in my years with them and they were always quick to act. <br/> <br/>In my opinion, they are a good middle of the road option. You're never going to be blown away by what you receive, but you could do worse.",2017-12-24
1922,A familiar banking experience,30761,10480,Synchrony Bank,46099,4,"I recently signed up for a new bank, and in my search came across Synchrony. I had already heard of them through their various offerings with store credit cards, but was happily surprised by their array of accounts and offerings. I enjoy the rates as well as their customer service. I had some issues when I tried to open, so I had to speak with someone immediately. I was very satisfied with the experience. The agent was friendly and understanding of the situation. I was able to get my account issues resolved in a timely manner and had not had a problem with it since. I am really excited about this company and what they are offering. Ive been looking into banking alternatives for a while but I think I will be sticking with this one for a while.",2017-12-15
1923,Great CD with a decent interest rate.,30759,10480,Synchrony Bank,46097,5,"Synchrony Bank's 15-month CD offer is a great way for new investors to dip their toes into the world of investing without needing a lot of capital. Since I already had a savings account with them, Synchrony Bank was the first choice when I went looking to invest into CD. Their customer service were quite helpful and engaging when I was opening my CD. It was a smooth process that took less than ten minutes to get done. I tried opening CD at other institutions, and their processes were much more difficult and time consuming. Synchrony Bank is an institution that respect their customer's time, so I never felt like I was being strung along needlessly. They got me up and running quickly and painlessly. Synchrony Bank is a bank well positioned for the future. If the future for online banks are like Synchrony Bank, then we should all be quite happy.",2017-12-14

I chose this bank, primarily, because of the much better than average interest rate. Sign-up and setting up transfer capability with other banks was simple, straight forward, and very quick. Executing transfers is a simple process with both deposits and withdrawals occurring within a maximum of 3 business days. The process is intuitive and efficient. The interest rate has increased modestly two times since I have opened the account. I was able to establish email alerts for events that I prefer to be notified about. The notifications have come through as expected. The Synchrony Bank website is robust and inclusive of all information I need regarding both my account and potential products I may want to consider in the future.",2017-12-14
1925,An Online Bank That Requires USPS Documents???,30728,10480,Synchrony Bank,46008,2,"Since I have been more than satisfied with Synchrony for the past year, I recently opened another high yield savings with them. Mainly due to the fact that their rates are very competitive even if I have to deal with some slight transfer delays.<br/><br/>However, shortly after opening our second joint account, they requested a signature card for my wife. As this is our 2nd Joint account, I know they should have both of our sig cards on file... how they only have mine is highly suspicious as I have copies of both that were sent over a year ago. So they either lost my wifes sig card or have highly suspect organization.<br/><br/>Considering they only accept a sig card via USPS (?!?) I would like to know what they did with her original sig card. Had they accepted an electronic version like my brokerage account, my IRA or my local bank even does, this would not be an issue.<br/><br/>Very poor Synchrony, very poor indeed...",2017-12-08

I also can set up direct deposit to transfer money into my account and the money is always there within 24 hours. This is a bank that I would recommend especially if you are using it for the same thing I am, they limit your pin withdrawals that makes your savings journey even easier.

1927,A member of synchrony bank for years.,30619,10480,Synchrony Bank,45682,4,"I have had several accounts with Synchrony. I can honestly say that I have never had a serious issue with them. The only thing that I'm not a huge fan of is the monthly fees. I actually called customer service and got the, to waive the monthly fees. The only thing is they still withdraw the fees each and every month and then eventually credit them back about five days later. I don't like that I have to wait that long to receive my cash back. A few of the fees are quite hefty, ten dollars and some change. I do like that they have mobile banking and I can have secure access to all of my accounts from anywhere. I also like the level of security that I have to go through to log in. It makes me feel safe to do what I need to do from a computer or a mobile device. I like the bank over all and do not intend to change anytime in the near future.",2017-12-05

While I don't have much experience working with their customer service dept. (a good thing in my opinion), I can say that I have never had any problems or been charged any fees that I did not expect on my account. I would not necessarily recommend them because every bank (unless they are out to get you) generally has no fees and perform the same exact basic functions.",2017-12-04
1930,Decent bank but poor customer service,30596,10480,Synchrony Bank,45657,3,"I have been banking with Synchrony for a few months just to expand my accounts to a different bank than the brick and mortar one I usually use. While overall I have found it to be satisfactory, my main complaint is with their customer service. Maybe I just got a bad representative on the day I called, but I felt like the person was incompetent and was not able to answer my questions in a professional and knowledgeable way. Maybe he had just started the job or something but even then I feel like he should've been trained properly to be able to inform me correctly about the products I was asking about. So this left me with a sour taste in my mouth towards Synchrony bank but I would say otherwise everything with them has been okay, pretty standard and average, no major complaints. This is something they definitely need to work on though. When I bank with someone, I want to feel like I can call customer service and get any issue resolved or get the information that I need, and as of right now i don't feel confident about that with them. However I will reassess this next time I call them for something. If the same things happens, I will probably close my account there because I will assume that they just have poor service and it was not a one time fluke.",2017-12-02
1931,Great Bank,30594,10480,Synchrony Bank,45655,5,I have a high yield savings account with Synchrony bank. I chose to open this account because it offers one of the highest interests rates in the industry. I have had this account for about six months and love it. The customer service is excellent. I have not had any issues with the bank. They offer no fees if you go over six transactions per statement cycle which is good although I don't withdraw often. I recently had to purchase a car because my car was done. The withdrawal process was seamless and there were no penalties. I also had to close the account and open a new account due to my personal information being compromised. It was such a easy process. I basically need a new account number. It was smooth transition. The mobile website is a little visually out dated. The Website is great and easy to use. I have never had any issues accessing my account or viewing statements. Overall I really like the bank and love my high yield savings account with them.,2017-12-02
1932,Great for a decent return on CD's & high yield savings accounts.,30582,10480,Synchrony Bank,45643,4,"I've been growing my money through CD investments for the past 15 years so I've definitely seen CD rates rise and decline a few times. At the worst I was only able to find a return on my investment locally that was around .4% on a 2 year deposit and that was just unacceptable for me so I began searching around online for a better return. Synchrony Bank had one of the best CD return rates I could find at the time (over 2% return rate) from an established banking entity so I called the 800 number on their website to inquire. I was unaware if any branches of Synchrony Bank were located near where I live but much to my surprise their customer service was actually very helpful over the phone and I was given very detailed instructions on how to open up an account and CD with them via their website. It seemed easy enough so I felt like I might be able to bank with them online only and wouldn't need a local branch to handle my business. Once I got started with the account sign up process online I decided to also open up a high yield savings account with them as well so that I could still access some of my money if I felt like the CD investment wasn't going as well as I had hoped. The high yield savings account didn't have quite as high of a investment return as the CD, but I like to play it save and Synchrony's website was designed well enough to allow me to customize my investments. The CD produced as I expected and I am very pleased with the investment return on my money. I have since reinvested my original deposit with Synchrony and am enjoying seeing my investments growing with this establishment. Their website is very user friendly and I have never needed any services offered by a branch establishment which makes me happy because it saves me time and hassle doing everything online. I would recommend Synchrony Bank for individuals seeking a pleasant return on their savings without a very long monetary commitment.",2017-11-30

I like how their services are easy to understand, transparent, and very clear and concise. The web and mobile experience is user-friendly and easy to use. They offer competitive interest rates on savings accounts and the fees are kept a absolute minimum compared to industry standards. I have never had any issues or complaints regarding Synchrony Bank, because their employees and executives are always striving to make the customers' needs come first above all else.

That's fine, except they send the messages to the wrong phone number! (it was the number of the secondary account holder - I confirmed they have the correct number for me on file).<br/>- When calling, they ask for your SSN and a confirmation ID, which defaults to the last 4 of my SSN. Again, that's fine EXCEPT the last 4 digits of my SSN wasn't accepted by their system. Really?!?<br/>- When I created my account, I setup a login and pwd. I use tools to keep track of my pwds. When I go to login the next time, they say my pwd doesn't work.<br/><br/>With systems that are such a complete mess as this, I am seriously considering reporting them to the FDIC and other regulators to protect other consumers from their debacle - how can anyone trust them to keep track of money?",2017-11-22

Their rates are always among the best that are out there which means I don't have to continuously find myself opening and closing CDs as they reach maturity and need renewal. Also they are among the best for straight savings accounts which require no time agreements and who's funds can be quickly transferred for use on bills and such.<br/>My only gripe with this bank is that their website can be a bit annoying with its security feature of calling with a one time code virtually every time I try to access it, but these days security is more of a necessary evil than a real complaint.",2017-11-20
1944,Synchrony Is Better ,30423,10480,Synchrony Bank,45281,4,"Starting a savings account with Synchrony Bank seemed weird to me at first. It was my first experience with online banking outside of credit cards, and I had already associated Synchrony with many store based credit card statements that would come to my house monthly in either my name or my wife's name. The idea of putting money into a bank such as this for a Savings account seemed almost foreign to me, and it was certainly unusual. However, after some research, I accepted this new type of banking, and indeed many credit offerors are creating similarly structured banking features these days. When I first joined Synchrony, I found the signup process easy to manage and the excitement of trying something new had an effect on my attitude about it all. I was initially very pleased with every step of the process - and especially the interest rate! However, now that time has passed and more banks have gotten on board, it seems that Synchrony is rather stuck where they started. Better user interfaces are available, better banking products, better interest rates. So while Synchrony, and online banking in general has distinct advantages in many cases over the traditional banking system, Synchrony seems to be in the middle of the pack at this time.",2017-11-19
1945,Synchrony is a good bank,30415,10480,Synchrony Bank,45273,4,"When it comes to opening bank accounts, I always do a lot of research from their fees, deposits, and what they offer. What made me choose Synchrony was that I also had other family members who used Synchrony bank. What I like about Synchrony bank is their high yield savings account which is more than what other big banks are using which has a 1.30% APY. A deposit is needed, but adding additional deposits does help overtime as it does grow. They also offer CDs, Money Market, etc What I also like about Synchrony is their customer service, they are always willing to help if you have an issue and if they can't help you figure it out, they will still try their best to help you the best way possible. Their perks are quite nice; they have a 5 tier ranking from Basic to Diamond and with a certain amount of money, you get perks like unlimited ATM reimbursements, no monthly fees. It's a good bank to try out if you haven't already.",2017-11-19
1946,above par in customer service,30409,10480,Synchrony Bank,45267,3,"I have used a few different banks over the course of my adolescence and adulthood. Some banks have been sub par, which was a reason to switch banks in the first place. I have been pleasantly surprised with the services that Synchrony has offered. From their elite customer service to their up to date, state of the art online banking site. I have had to call regarding an overdraft fee at one point. The service rep was very helpful and ended up reversing the fee after some investigation, as it wasn't my fault the account went negative. It was nice to be spoken to with dignity and respect, not like I had done something wrong that I was trying to get out of. I really appreciated that.",2017-11-18
1947,My Synchrony Bank Experience,30390,10480,Synchrony Bank,45208,5,I opened the account just to have an extra account for Christmas and the like. I immediately notice that the rate was better than US Bank. I decided to transfer most of my savings there. I am glad I did. I get regular statements on my earnings and many other interesting deals in my inbox. I can access my money quickly and have had no problems whatsoever.,2017-11-17
1948,Simple Yet Effective Place For Your Savings Needs.,29781,10480,Synchrony Bank,43546,5,"Synchrony Bank offers competitive interest rates for its saving accounts. These competitive rates, combined with the ease to which it was to sign up and open an account online, was what initially drew me to Synchrony Bank. Depositing money into my savings account is simple and easy enough to do, though I do find the time it takes for the money to be credited to my savings account to be a bit slow; it can take up to five days for my deposit to show up in my savings account. Also, their customer service is excellent. I had a bit if a problem establishing an online account after signing up. I called their customer service and got the issue resolved in less than ten minutes. That's the kind of customer service I always want. <br/> <br/>The online interface used by Synchrony Bank is easy and simple to use, much unlike some other institutions I used in the past. You would be surprised how much a simple interface makes banking so much easy and more pleasant. Overall, I find Synchrony Bank to be a well run, well made institution for those that want to start a savings account online. Sign up is simple and easy to do, and the interest rates are in line with other places that are much harder to sign up for.",2017-10-15
1949,Synchrony is a decent bank,29767,10480,Synchrony Bank,43532,4,"I have a 5 year CD with Synchrony Bank. They do give a competitive rate compared to my local banks, which is why I went with them. I have had a little trouble with customer service because I can only contact them by phone or email. With trouble I mainly mean wait times and such. They do take care of the request that I ask. I would just like it to take a little less time. They are always friendly and apologetic. All in all I have enjoy my experience with Synchrony Bank. I would definitely recommend them to people that I know, and I have done just that.",2017-10-12
1950,Love the High Yield Savings Account!,29758,10480,Synchrony Bank,43523,4,I decided to switch this bank from a local bank because I was having a difficult time with my local banks about my deposits being posted in a timely manner to my savings. A friend of mine had been banking online for years and recommend Synchrony Bank. I applied easily for a savings account through the website and was able to easily transfer money over to my savings. Each month a portion of each paycheck is deposited into my savings account. I enjoy that they do have great security and identity protection as I had been a victim of fraud in the past. Anytime I have had concerns I have always been able to get someone on the phone and have the issue resolved within minutes. I have noticed that my interest rates are high but with the High Yield Savings Account at 1.20% APY and that makes me incredibly happy because my local bank was not even near that. I also enjoy the fact that if I did need to withdraw money from the ATM I will not be charged a fee. Overall I would recommend this bank to anyone looking for an online savings account. It's been great so far!,2017-10-11
1951,Online banking that is easy and secure,29748,10480,Synchrony Bank,43512,3,"I have been a customer of Synchrony Bank for a couple of years now. I mainly use them for a savings account that is separate from my main banking accounts. I do this so that one: all of my eggs aren't in one basket, and two: if it's out of sight, it's out of mind and I'll be less likely to dip into it. Synchrony has been very easy to use so far. Their website is pretty simple and straightforward, and I really like their mobile experience. I've only had to contact customer service once due to an error in a deposit from one of my employers. The customer service rep was very helpful and the issue I had was resolved quickly. If there was a brick and mortar location near me, I might even consider moving my main accounts to them.",2017-10-10
1952,Synchrony Bank review,29729,10480,Synchrony Bank,43475,3,I've been banking with Synchrony Bank for several years now. I use it because of the higher interest rates. I have a high yield savings account and several IRA accounts that I open each year. I put a small amount in each week to the savings account by way of a direct deposit and I transfer extra money in as needed. It's very easy to do transfers. This I like. What I don't like is the time consuming effort each year to open an IRA account. It takes almost a month to six weeks to set it up because they have to mail you all this paperwork back and forth. It's a bit confusing and very time consuming effort. And I always worry that it's not done in the correct year. This could be simplified since other online banks make it simple to do this.,2017-10-09
1953,One of the best,29714,10480,Synchrony Bank,43457,4,I had an instance where someone got a hold of my card and started purchasing a bunch of stuff. They contacted me almost immediately when they realized the charges weren't normal as to what I normally buy and spend. They were able to put the account on halt immediately and we were able to track down the person. The company pressed charges and we were able to get all of the money back. I'm very satisfied with this company and helped me with a lot of headache.,2017-10-07
1954,Very Bad ACH And Bank Wire Transfer Service,29862,10480,Synchrony Bank,43809,3,"ACH service is delayed 2-3 business days for both inbound and out bound transfers. For outbound transfers, they withdraw the money from your account immediately but deposit it at the destination bank 2-3 days later. For inbound transfers they withdraw the money from your other bank that night but deposit it in your Synchrony account 2-3 days later.<br/><br/>Wire transfer service for outbound wires is extremely poor. The purpose of a wire is speed. But even if you call in to send the wire early in the morning, they do not even begin to process it until over 4 hours later. The wire will not be received by the receiving bank until after the business day in over. Therefore, it would be just as quick to transfer via ACH by initiating the transfer at the receiving bank and designating Synchrony as the source of funds.",2017-10-03
1955,Great experience,29673,10480,Synchrony Bank,43415,5,This company has by far the best customer service. I've been on the phone a few times to handle simple issues and I'm never put on hold. I'm always talking to a representative who doesn't mind taking their time in helping me out. I'm always satisfied and my answers are always fulfilled. I accidentally got locked out of my account (my fault) and they were able to unlock the account and set me up with a new password in a matter of minutes.,2017-10-02
1956,CD with a great rate,29633,10480,Synchrony Bank,43315,5,"Synchrony bank offered top notch service when it came to opening my CD (certificate of deposit) account. They offered a great rate and even had the slogan listed as ""what are your financial dreams today"". I opened a CD like many people do to squirrel away extra money for a purchase I plan on making in the future (boat).<br/> <br/>The easiest part of the whole process was signing up and getting my starting balance deposited. At no time during the process did I feel lost or in need of any kind of assistance. I have used other banking institutions in the past and have experienced issues all the way from trouble logging into my account, to obtaining the money once my CD had matured.<br/> <br/>All-in-all I would say that Synchrony Bank was spot on in the service they offered me and the value they brought to the table.",2017-09-29
1957,Synchrony evaluation,29622,10480,Synchrony Bank,43304,3,"Synchrony is a pretty good bank. Some things are great like their savings offers which are high (well relatively high) interest. Unfortunately, their customer support is ranging from abysmal to great. Every interaction is different in customer service, which is really frustrating. Can I do so and so? They will say yes on one site, and no to another...<br/>While I don't necessarily like their customer service, their products are still worth the occasional troubles.",2017-09-28
1958,"Synchrony Bank - Not the worst, not the best",29618,10480,Synchrony Bank,43299,3,"I currently use two banks, USAA and Synchrony. If I had to do it over I would probably just stick with USAA, however, at the time I wanted more than one banking option. Synchrony isn't terrible, but I have had some less than ideal situations. I constantly have trouble signing into my account. Also, paying bills online was not a very easy and efficient process but I will say they have improved in that area. My one big complaint is with their customer service. They're polite but when I called to take care of an issue the person on the phone seemed distracted. I had to repeat one thing 3 times. Other times he didn't seem to understand what I was talking about. Honestly, it was a pretty simple issue so I can only assume I didn't have his full attention. Also regarding customer service, if they need information from you, they will called about a dozen times a day, but if you need information from them it's all of the sudden hard to get someone on the phone. Other than that they have decent fees and products.",2017-09-27

1960,Money Is In Limbo Each Time You Transfer In Or Out,29811,10480,Synchrony Bank,43617,1,"As others have posted, this bank holds your money for several days before posting it to your account. In effect they are charging a fee of whatever interest you would have earned over those several days that they hold the funds. I sent a letter to the bank after noticing that whenever I do an ACH transaction (initiated from my online synchrony account) the funds show as withdrawn from the source account on the day after I put in the request but the funds do not show up in my synchrony account for 4 business days. This is in contrast to synchrony's disclosure statement which says that for ACH transactions originated by synchrony with a bank that has be pre-registered for your account the funds will be available on the same business day that synchrony receives them. The rep who called me back about the letter said that it takes that long for them to receive the funds. I pointed out to her that ACH transactions are required to clear in a single business day. We agreed to disagree. Any class action lawyers out there?",2017-09-25

It is above my expectations. Staff is always friendly and helpful. My savings account was easy to open. Everything is online since they don't have any bank branches. I discovered I actually like that. I travel a lot do it's inconvenient for me to go to a physical location to do business.",2017-09-23
1962,They're just alright.,29515,10480,Synchrony Bank,43105,3,"I've had a high yield savings account with Synchrony Bank since I was 18 years old when I got my settlement check from a dog bite. Their fees are astronomical. I have to pay a ridiculous amount to keep my money with them, when the interest I earn barely makes it worth it. The website frequently locks me out from ""failed attempts"" to login even though my login information is all correct. I then have to sit on hold for usually about 20 minutes to a half hour and wait for a representative to update and reset my login info. I have been tempted to move my money on numerous occasions.",2017-09-19
1963,Disappointed Long Term Customer,29476,10480,Synchrony Bank,3939,1,"Very disappointed with recent notification of the policy to discontinue the practice of voluntary federal withholding on interest earnings. I have literally spent hours over the past 24 months with Synchrony related to this subject and after previous satisfactory handling by them they have now discontinued this valuable service. After opening numerous CD's based on the availability of this service, they now are ending that option. Based on my rather extensive interest earnings, it is essential that I have a bank that offers this. I will be closing out all of my Synchrony accounts as they mature and move the money to a more customer friendly bank. I currently have this service available at all four of my other institutions that I deal with and it makes my year ending tax bill much more manageable.",2017-09-08
1964,So Far So Good,29474,10480,Synchrony Bank,42959,4,"I just opened a high yield savings account about a month ago in order to save without touching it. This is because I'm undisciplined in saving with my current credit union as I can easily transfer between savings and checking. I read reviews and this was rated highly with a high APY return.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm currently happy with my decision to start using this external savings account. <br/><br/>I wouldn't say the sign up process was easy or smooth compared to lots of other things I've signed up for, but it wasn't difficult either. I was able to get my account number/information needed for registering an account online by calling the next day after my application was approved. Later I called after playing around with my online account and saw that I needed to sign the signature card manually instead of electronically, so I printed, signed, and mailed.<br/>About a week and half later, the info I wanted right away ended up coming in the mail. So patience is needed I guess. <br/><br/>Customer service was okay. They weren't welcoming or anything like that, but did answer the questions I had. <br/><br/>Transfers between my external credit union was supposed to be set up to come from my checking but is coming from my personal savings instead. That could have been my mistake and I'm not even worried about it right now.<br/>Transfers are taking around 3 days to be completed, which is below average in my experience. Again, not the biggest deal for me right now but I do hope this improves.<br/><br/>Do not confused their banking with their various credit cards services. I am not sure I'll ever use their credit cards due to the million complaints about their customer service or very inflexible policies that are not people or consumer oriented. I just wanted to be clear that my positive review is based on their savings account only.",2017-09-08
1965,Terrible Service,29445,10480,Synchrony Bank,42859,1,"Amazon was using Synchrony Bank for their credit card and switched cards to a different card with Synchrony Bank. Sadly Synchrony and Amazon didn't change the card on my Amazon Account I am guessing because I never got a bill from the new card. I receive all bills via email. Transunion that I had a late payment (and it was a whopping $747 plus the above charges. I was able to get the 2 charges removed. I immediately paid the bill online. I finally called a supervisor because I couldn't believe that I had my credit score dive over 60 points. It's still good but not excellent like it had been. She is going to notify the creidit union that it was not my error. I never got an email telling me that I owed the money. I don't know if Amazon or Synchrony Bank when the cards were changed to a different number didn't update user information sounds like that's what happened. I closed the card. Thankfully Amazon also uses Chase Bank and I get outstanding service from that Bank. Now if I could convince Talbots, Warehouse Discount and Chevron to change banks that would ner great.",2017-09-06
1966,Good Bank For Those That Want An Online Savings Account,29123,10480,Synchrony Bank,42233,4,"I was shopping for an online savings account to place about 6 months' worth of savings for an emergency. I looked about and saw several online banks providing savings account services with decent-to-good interest rates. Synchrony Bank was one of those online banks. At first, they weren't my first choice; Goldman Sachs Bank was my top pick. But I found opening an account with Goldman Sachs to be difficult. They could not positively confirm my identity at all, despite the fact that I gave them my social security number, tax filings, and a photocopy of my drive's license. I soon gave up around they asked for a third round of identity confirming documentation. I tried Synchrony Bank as my second choice, and the experience I had with them are night and day different compared to Goldman Sachs Bank. I was quickly confirmed and my savings account was opened within a day. When I could not register an account to manage my new savings account, customer service was quick to remedy the issue. I have had a great experience with Synchrony Ban so far. I highly recommend them to those who want a no frills savings account with a competitive interest rate.",2017-08-26
1967,Very pleased with Synchrony Bank,28808,10480,Synchrony Bank,41474,4,"I wanted to earn some interest on a small sum of money I inherited. I also wanted to be able to manage the money myself and avoid the hassles of dealing with pushy bank staff. I took a chance on Synchrony Bank and it has really paid off. I now have an IRA and a high yield savings account with them. The interest rate on my savings account is significantly higher than anything offered by my bricks and mortar bank. The account minimum is also very fair and I was able to start saving with a small sum of money which is great as it supports those of us trying to get (back) on our feet financially. The website and app are very user friendly. I have never experienced tech issues or any mistakes in my balances. I can access it 24/7 from all my devices and it has helped me to get really involved with my finances. I have rarely had to contact customer service but when I have I received help immediately, I wasn't transferred from department to department like most financial institutions. One person, one quick solution. Overall a really great experience and I am really impressed with online banking and can't see myself going back now.",2017-08-10
1968,Best Switch I've Ever Made,28707,10480,Synchrony Bank,41260,5,"I decided to open a High Yield Savings Account with Synchrony after looking at other online banks and finding that this one had no minimum deposit, no fees, and a APY. I have been a customer now for a little over a year and I have made 116% more than I ever did with my personal bank's savings account. Making deposits from my checking account is easy and if the deposit is initiated during a weekday, the transaction goes through very quickly. The main account I created was joint and it was extremely easy to set up. Then I was able to open a second, individual account for a beneficiary AND I can access them both with the same log in information. The BEST part is the account started out with a 1.05% APY when I opened it and in the past month that number has increased to 1.20%.",2017-08-04
1969,Great interest on a savings account,28266,10480,Synchrony Bank,40057,4,"I have been a customer of Synchrony Bank for approximately 2 years now. It was really easy to get an account started and my ATM card arrived pretty quickly. I like that Synchrony offers a higher interest rate than many other banks, both online banks and traditional banks. There are a lot of perks available, depending on how much you have saved with them. All accounts enjoy no monthly fees, some ATM fee refunds, and free ID theft resolution. Accounts with high balances get their own dedicated customer service phone number. I've never had a problem with my account, so I've never had to call. I would recommend Synchrony Bank to anyone who wants to start saving their money in a separate account, such as saving for an emergency fund.",2017-07-12
1970,NO STARS IF WE COULD,28577,10480,Synchrony Bank,40833,1,"We were a high yield savings customer for many years and as long as the money goes into savings there is no problem. Great interest rate...no question. <br/>Once you use their credit card, or use their other products that's when the magic happens...VERY RUDE & UNPROFESSIONAL managers & supervisors!!!!<br/>Front line reps are very polite and professional BUT once you have an issue and a manager/supervisor is involved you would think the politeness and professionalism would continue. WELL IT DOESN'T!!!!<br/>On the phone for 2.5 hours being placed on hold then transferred again...only to be, you guessed it...on hold again and again. Their famous words: I'm going to put you on a brief 3 to 4 minute hold, is that OK? Well it's never 3-4 minutes!!!<br/>So GOOD-LUCK to you if you don't 'heed the advice' of the MANY who have represented their experiences and reviews as a 1 star. READ REVIEWS BEFORE LOCKING IN WITH THEIR CREDIT CARD. <br/>I've recently read many different 'review sites' on Synchrony Bank & Credit Card which I should have done BEFORE I got involved. BIG MISTAKE for not learning before hand that reviews are VERY helpful!!! Don't let the high interest rate fool you. Look around as there are other online banks that comparable rates. No bank will have excellent reviews but I'd take my chances because they HAVE to be better that Synchrony!!!!!",2017-07-06

All of this and she can't open an account to put money into!!! She wasn't asking for a loan. I've been a customer with Synchrony for over three years and until today have never had an issue, yet they took non of that into consideration. The service representative and her supervisor as well were very condescending and continued to repeat the same verbiage over and over instead of trying to rectify the situation. I hung up very dissatisfied. I then called Ally and they were more than willing to help figure out how to make it work! Needless to say I will be moving all of my investments. The rates might not be as high but in the long run customer service always wins.",2017-07-05
1972,Synchrony Bank IRA CD and CD accounts,28130,10480,Synchrony Bank,39662,4,"I've been with Synchrony Bank for about three years. They are huge, and have been around a while, have competitive rates overall, and have, overall, a good reputation, which is why I chose to go with them over other online banks. I like that they answer the phone and that the customer does not have to wait to speak to a rep. However, the different reps have given me wrong information, which has caused me aggravation in trying to set up an account or retrieve money. So, sometimes, I wind up having to call back and call back and call back to verify, to untangle, what is going on. In the end, it has always worked out and the reps seem to genuinely want to help, but it is NOT helpful if it wastes someone's time calling back to say such and such did not arrive, did not happen, etc. Sometimes, I've had to call three and four times to get all the paperwork out to me, and it doesn't arrive, so it's a delay of over a month. Also, their rates are NOT always competitive. Most of the time they are, but one always needs to check. But, they are consistently among the top online banks as far as rates go. Again, my money has been transferred to my brick and mortar credit union, and not lightning fast, but not that slowly either. So, my overall recommendation is to use them. I have IRA CDs there right now, and they do send statements that are professional and easy to read, like clockwork, which is more than I can say for other online banks. They have a 2K minimum deposit for CDs, which is not unreasonable. On a 5 year CD, which is what I have, the early withdrawal is a year's interest, which isn't great, but I don't plan on withdrawing my IRA CDs. Some places only charge 6 months interest penalty, so best to check, according to what is important to you. I've also never had any surprise fees, as with other banks. They are very fee free, in my opinion. Very reasonable.",2017-07-03

This is the first strictly online banking institution that I have signed up for and the process was so simple. I had no problems creating my savings account and transferring money. My favorite part of Synchrony is the high interest rate. It's by far the highest rate I've personally seen for a savings account. I'm assuming customer service is good, but I haven't had to contact them at any point since I haven't had any issues. The fact that there aren't fees for withdrawing money is a plus as well.

1976,Word Of Warning,28237,10480,Synchrony Bank,24532,3,"So I have been banking with Synchrony for a few years. From a product, fee and interest rate perspective I have been very satisfied. Today however I discovered a big policy blunder. Via the Synchrony website I requested a transfer from an external bank into my Synchrony account. The money was debited from that account on 6/7/17. But it has not appeared in my Synchrony account and after calling CS I was told it will not be credited to my account for another 1-2 days...so up to 3 days from the debit date. So the net result is that my funds are in no-mans land, earning interest for them, but not for me. The claimed concept that the clearing house is sitting on my funds for two full days defies logic. With other banks I have dealt with (except one), the debit date and the credit date are the same or at most one day off. To make matters worse the CS agent tried to convince me that this was for MY benefit as they will not place any hold on my funds ONCE they are credited. I gave up.",2017-06-08

Their customer service is very good and their staff go out of their way to help you out or answer any questions you may have--even if you think they are stupid or irrelevant. Their website is very user friendly and one of the easiest navigate that I've ever found. All of your account information is pretty straight forward and easy to find.

It is so easy for me to deposit, transfer and bill pay with them. I love getting text alerts every time I have a withdrawal, payment or deposit so I can track everything. It also doubles as a security feature since I can see what charges happen and know if it is fraudulent right away instead of it being overlooked on my statement. I also enjoy that they do not place a hold on checks that I deposit. My mind is at ease knowing there isn't any mishaps and my money will be there in the exact time frame expected.

I also have to say their rates are very competitive and they don't charge crazy fees like some banks. Their website is very user friendly. Anyone could easily navigate around their webpage and get to the information they need. I have found that everything on their site is pretty straight forward. I don't mind using their site at all.",2017-06-02
1980,Horrible Service If Victim Of Fraud,28167,10480,Synchrony Bank,39775,1,"I was a victim of fraudulent activity back in early December and I am STILL trying to rectify it with this bank. After having daily calls from the bank, and I do mean daily, sometimes twice a day, I'm still being charged for charges that are not mine. I've spoken to about about 15 associates who were not able to help remove them, the Fraud Department is unresponsive. One Associate was helpful and thought she could help solve this to no avail. Today I received another notice in the mail and the amount due is now more than it was when they originally sent me a bill. I'm beyond frustrated. <br/>The Associates I have spoken to are all extremely nice and seemingly helpful, however I'm still being held responsible for charges I did not make and we're are almost in June. Horrible situation.",2017-05-31
1981,A solid bank with great CDs,27774,10480,Synchrony Bank,39018,4,"I initially wanted to start investing my money and I decided to look into opening a CD with this bank. I shopped around for a while and this bank had the best rates. Synchrony would be my best bet and it is, even though the customer service could be better. Even though the customer service was my only negative experience I can't help but focus on it considering it wont be the last time I will need some help and guidance from the company. <br/> <br/>The only website is much easier to deal with as the online customer service is completely different from the phone operators so I was able to find some satisfaction there. All in all I give this bank a solid 4 for what it has provided me.",2017-05-24
1982,Declined Application,28041,10480,Synchrony Bank,39512,1,Wanted to send a check over wiring the money for a CD. Was told to wait because they would have to verify my information. Got a letter a week later saying the account was denied because they were unable to verify my identity. Interesting. Never have run into this before in forty years of having Certified Deposits.,2017-05-20
1983,Earn Better Interest,27745,10480,Synchrony Bank,38989,5,"I always thought I would have difficulty changing to an online only financial institution until I realized how little I use my bank's branches. The last time I needed to go to the actual bank was when I transferred my single account into a joint account. Other than that, I haven't stepped into a bank in years. The problem is that I have been taking a hit on interest in order to pay for human interaction that I never use! I switched to Synchrony in order to reap better interest rates. The account setup was easy. I manage all of my savings transactions online (just like my previous ""big bank""). Don't fool yourself into thinking that it's ""scammy"" or untrustworthy. Your interests rates will literally triple (in some cases) just by switching to something that lacks what you do not already use - perfect!",2017-05-15
1984,East to deal with,27686,10480,Synchrony Bank,38889,4,"I have been dealing with Synchrony Bank for about two years now. I have an online savings account with them. For the time I've been with them, I have had no problems at all. Everything has been easy and whenever I had questions, I got quick answers. They are good with email response and don't have long wait times on the phone which is nice. They have low fees and the interest is good when comparing to what I can get from others. They have some other things I may be interested in and I will look into those, for sure. Other reviews I've read of them are good also. Hoping to stay with them for a while, as everything I need has been taken care of so far.",2017-05-06
1985,Mobile Deposit Non Existent,27821,10480,Synchrony Bank,39136,1,"I had enjoyed Synchrony, despite the lack of customer service until their mobile deposit became a complete failure. It will not accept checks and constantly tells you the image is unclear. You can rewrite the check, try a different device, etc., but good luck getting your deposit made. Without physical locations, this takes away the point of online banking. I'm not mailing a check every time I need to move money into my accounts.",2017-05-04
1986,Synchrony Bank Savings,27675,10480,Synchrony Bank,38877,4,"Synchrony Bank is an online-only bank that offers a range of account options. If you're not familiar with Synchrony Bank, they're probably best known for being the bank behind a lot of store-specific credit cards. I first became familiar with Synchrony Bank as my Amazon Prime card is issued by them. Now, I have a savings account with Synchrony Bank that earns one of the highest interest rates that I could find. I get 1.05% interest on my savings account. It doesn't really seem like much but it's a higher rate than you can get from most banks and definitely higher than traditional brick and mortar banks. I like to invest most of my money but for short term money that you may need, putting it in a savings account that earns interest is better than nothing.",2017-05-04

Synchony did not send the transfer requests to the financial institutions. At first I thought it was a mail issue, but after having the multiple financial institutions inform me that they had not received the transfer requests form Synchrony, it became obvious to me that Synchrony did not send out the requests. I am closing my account with Synchrony.",2017-04-27

1989,Love it!,27488,10480,Synchrony Bank,38500,4,"After doing some research for online banks, I recently signed up online for a saving account with Synchrony Bank. I was asked about 10 questions, just the basic name and address and identification information. I was able to choose the method of my initial deposit. I chose to do a bank transfer, but you could mail the deposit in also. It was extremely easy. I was also surprised how fast it all went, it took about 15 minutes. I expected a far more time consuming and more complicated process than it really was. So far I have not had any problems.",2017-04-21
1990,Synchrony is awesome!,27467,10480,Synchrony Bank,38479,5,"I opened a Synchrony savings account a little over three months ago and have been very pleased so far! There are a few things I really like about Synchrony...The first is the interest rate, which is currently at 1.04% for me. It's much higher than banks that aren't strictly online. Synchrony pays me the same amount of interest in one month that the savings account I've had since I was a child pays me in a whole year! I also have significantly more money in my old savings account. Another thing I really like about Synchrony is the option to withdrawal money without any penalty. Definitely a keeper for my banking needs.",2017-04-16
1991,Very helpful...,27418,10480,Synchrony Bank,38406,4,"After using many different online banks, and having the service and products be sub par, I was surprised by the ease of use and helpfulness of Synchrony Bank. Any time I have an issue, I am able to speak with a person that will help me resolve it within minutes. I have never talked to someone who had no idea what they were doing. Another positive, is the 1.25 APY on CDs over 2000 dollars. I have several through the bank, and from my research, they offer a very competitive rates. Another positive about this bank is the ease of use when it comes to using the mobile version of the bank. I really enjoy the simplicity, and have never had an issue or had a problem locating what I wanted to find on the site.",2017-04-07
1992,Synchrony,27398,10480,Synchrony Bank,38345,4,"Synchrony Bank savings is one of the best in the market if you are truly looking to save and get the best rate. Synchrony Bank offers online banking with the option of a card to use for withdrawals. If you are looking for a bank that is at you fingertips and best for your wallet, this is it. Simply set up a direct deposit between your regular checking to their online savings and watch your balance thrive. Their site is extremely user friendly and easy to maneuver around. The rates are some of the best on the savings market. With not having to have a minimum balance requirement like other banks, this is the BEST out there for anyone looking to accrue savings quickly. Synchrony Bank Savings comes highly recommended. Current Interest Rate on their High Yield Savings is 1.04% and their current APY is 1.05%. You won't want to miss this.",2017-04-06
1993,Why to go with Synchrony for retirement IRA savings,27376,10480,Synchrony Bank,38323,5,"I like Synchrony bank because their customer service is out of this world. Being self employed can sometimes make things very complicated when setting up retirement funds. The representatives at Synchrony bank are so helpful. When I called to set up an account I was presented with a personal banker who helped me set up the right plan to maintain my business tax plans. I didn't feel taken advantage of, or like he was trying to push risk on me to make money. I'm not always able to contribute steadily because as a self employed individual sometimes my finances are up and down. Whenever I do contribute I always call Synchrony bank to see how contributions will affect my future earnings and they are always very helpful. They are also extremely helpful with tax questions and requests for necessary documents. I have no complaints really.",2017-04-04
1994,No Major Complaints Here,27367,10480,Synchrony Bank,38314,4,"Even since Synchrony switched over their website to the new layout and design the experience has been fantastic. I had a different bank in the past that never updated their software or made an effort to keep up with technology trends and it made me wonder if they care. With Synchrony Bank not only can I keep track of all my banking transactions within seconds but I also have the ability to check my credit card transactions and get up to date credit scores each month and they will contact me about any suspicious activity on my accounts too. I'm currently in the market for an HYS, CD or IRA and I'm looking forward to chatting with a representative to see what Synchrony has to offer here. Keep up the good work Synchrony!",2017-04-03
1995,Decent Online Bank,27291,10480,Synchrony Bank,38142,3,"I recently moved my online bank account from Ally to Synchrony Bank. Ally currently offers just 1.00% while Synchrony offers a bit more at 1.05%. While that is a small difference - everything helps in this economy especially for risk adverse person like myself. They also have the highest 12 MONTH CD at 1.25% -- no other bank comes close to this. So it is really easy to setup a CD ladder and gain a few bucks while not locking in all your money. One thing that Synchrony doesn't have that Ally has was the great customer service. If you have a problem with Ally you can talk to a real person really quick. However with Synchrony, I feel their customer service department is lacking.<br/> <br/>If you want great rates on your saving and the best rate for a 12 MONTH CD -- I would go with Synchrony any day of the week. Remember that it is an online saving account and online bank so there are limitation. If these limitations are okay with you it definitely beats getting 0% at your local Chase bank.",2017-04-03
1996,Highest Yield Savings,27273,10480,Synchrony Bank,38105,4,"We use Synchrony Bank for our savings account. Synchrony has one of the highest, if not the highest, interest rates in the country at a little over one percent. The account was easy to set up and manage online, and has simple tabs and drop down menus to use whatever features the account holder needs to use. The only con I see is that there are two Synchrony savings websites. The other website is called My Optimizer Plus and is not the same as the Synchrony savings website. Not knowing of the disparity, I had difficulty logging in to the other website. I know for next time, but can see the confusion it may cause to someone. Transfer usually take a few days to go into your other primary bank account, so if you don't always need savings right away, you should be fine.",2017-04-01
1997,Good online Savings Account,27234,10480,Synchrony Bank,38035,4,"They provide the best interest rate available for online savings accounts. It is currently around 1.06%. In today's economy that is a high rate, believe it or not. There are no fees to open a savings account. It is very easy to transfer money into and out of the account. It does take 3 days or so for transfers to complete. It would be nice if they could speed up that process, but it is not bad as is. It is a very easy experience to open an account with the bank. I was approved in under 5 minutes. I have had an account with them for 5 years and have never had an issue.",2017-03-29
1998,"Lovely Site, Worrisome Fees",27230,10480,Synchrony Bank,38031,4,"Haven't really necessarily done too much banking with them but I've had an account and I'm beginning to love it. I wanted to start using an online bank where I earn more interest since I'm coming from a background where the only other financial institution I've used has been a credit union. It's surprising how much better the website is compared with the other website I use. That said, I've been reading up on the fees and their applications, and I feel worried. I don't know how it compares with a non-bank, but I know fees (e.g., I know minimum payments on past credit are at least $27 under my contract) are higher than those on my credit union.<br/> <br/>That being said, even though it scares me, it's not a bad bank by any means. Trawling information was a little difficult, even logged in, and finding the details of my contract was a little difficult. Still, it's a stylish looking website and it just feels safe and useful, even though I probably ought to be afraid of it.",2017-03-29
1999,Great Customer Service,27126,10480,Synchrony Bank,37792,4,"I opened a checking account with Synchrony Bank due to an employer 5 years ago and I wasn't particularly excited about it initially. One of the first things I noticed was that their cellphone app was quite outdated and not very user friendly, which I really disliked because I like to check my balance and other information online very often, since it's easier. Another aspect I disliked was their overdraft fee which seemed a little bit too high compared with other banks I had experience with. But now to the part that really made me like this bank: the customer support. I had my wallet stolen along with my credit card and was very worried about losing the amount I had in my checking account, but the Synchrony Bank's customer support was exceptionally fast and understand, they froze everything and sent me a new card immediately, which I received in a few days. I had friends tell me they had never seen a faster and more effective customer support in such a situation, so I believe their outdated phone app and fees aren't that big of a deal when you have the security of knowing that they will fully support and help you in unexpected situations like the one I went through.",2017-03-21

2002,Good Experience,26745,10480,Synchrony Bank,36941,5,"I applied online to open an account with the bank as a new customer. The questions asked were minimal. Soon after I received a call from a rep to guide me through the rest of the account creation process. The rep was mostly nice. I have little tech knowledge but he guided me through the process. It was a simple process and the rep was helpful. They even ran me through some of the perks and benefits for having an account. Depending on how much money you have in your account, you get different perks. Tha'ts pretty awesome. I would definitely trust and recommend Synchrony Bank to my family and friends. I also ended up opening an IRA and a CD account with them. One of the better banks I have worked with and I have worked with over 13 different banks.",2017-02-21
2003,Its okay but could be better!,26650,10480,Synchrony Bank,36677,3,"I use this bank for some of my financial needs, Its a good bank to use but my main issue is with their customer service. I had set my account up a long time ago about 2 years. I set up online banking and bill pay for my deposits for my checking account to pay my bills. Every month when I go to log in it never recognizes my log in information. I call customer service every month and they always verify my log in and it always correct. They make me go through the whole process of changing my password. Then the next month it happens all over again, so I call. The last time I called the lady proceeded to tell me just to mail in my deposits verses getting the issue fixed. I was highly upset and told her that they really need to correct the issue because I only use online checking and bill pay. She stated she didn't know what to tell me. I asked for a manager and she hung up on me. The bank itself is good but the customer service is horrible. So unless you use the mail for deposits every month don't bother signing up for the online checking and bill payment system because you cant get in and they will not help you.",2017-02-17

Their web/mobile service is excellent. I had a concern about my account balance, went online and signed in, and the concern was satisfied almost immediately. Their online account management is simple, clear and gives all the information needed when you sign in. An excellent experience. Customer service is friendly and helpful, which is important when banking. I had to call in a couple of weeks ago over an issue. The issue was handled easily by a friendly, courteous woman who treated me well.",2017-02-16
2005,Synchrony Does Savings Right,26633,10480,Synchrony Bank,36660,3,"I haven't been using Synchrony Bank for very long but I can already tell that I'm going to love them! When I was searching around for competitive rates I was shocked when I saw what they were offering. The initial deposit to get the posted rate was a little high, but it was worth it in the end for the high interest. Before this, I had a savings account with Discover with lower interest, however when I saw the higher interest at Synchrony I quickly moved what I could over. They made opening an account easy and I was done opening my new savings in probably ten minutes or so. On top of that, their customer service has been great and they're usually fairly quick to respond with emails. I don't think I've had to wait any longer than a day to get an answer for my question. I also greatly appreciate their nerdy side with their partnering with Marvel for some exclusive content. As a nerd myself (not to mention someone who likes to save money) I couldn't be any happier and plan to open another account with them soon.",2017-02-14

It is normally at the top of the list for savings accounts as it has the best rates and charges no fees. The interest rate is well above what other banks offer. The website is user friendly and when I've had to call customer service they have been helpful. When I had a problem, they quickly solved it and were very friendly and respectful. <br/>As it is a savings account, I don't normally need to withdraw money, but on the occasions that I have the fees have been refunded - they refund up to $5 per month. I normally make direct online transfers and try not to withdraw. It is easy to log in and see my progress in savings.",2017-02-03

Also, Synchrony offers great interest rates and terms for ATM use. I had some issues activating our debit cards (which were a huge plus in my opinion) and customer service was great and helped me with a short wait time. Synchrony also followed up with snail mail needing signature cards, etc. All postage was paid and was easy to understand. I don't think their website is that efficient. When I tried to set up my account the mobile check image was not accepted. I continue to have a difficult time logging in through their website. But overall I really enjoy Synchrony and look forward to using them for other products.",2017-01-31
2008,Good but needs more work.,26428,10480,Synchrony Bank,36052,4,"I saw an ad online about Synchrony Bank offering high yielding savings and no annual cost/fees. Since my old bank had 0% interest i decided to open an account. I put in $5,000 into the high yielding bank account. It as easy to set up and easy to use. I could pay my bills and i liked getting monthly interest payments. However, it seemed like the website was new or something. There are times when I couldn't log into the system because the website was down. this is really annoying since I needed to check if I still have money or enough to pay my bills. Also the mobile app is ok but when it lags.Like when you type in a 5 you have to wait a second and then click the next number. that's just annoying. I removed the app and do all my banking online. I later opened up a money market because I got a special offer for putting 10k into a money market and I got $100 dollars. I have never spoken anyone with SB which is great since I hate talking to people. All the information is online and the FAQS are very useful.",2017-01-26
2009,Pleasantly Surprised,26420,10480,Synchrony Bank,36041,3,"I had heard from friends about online banks, but was wary of them. One day I just decided to take the risk with a small amount of money. There were so many out there I didn't know where to start but Synchrony kept coming up with favorable feedback so I thought I would give it a shot. As I looked at it more and more, I was thrilled about the interest rate on savings account, that it reimbursed (to a certain amount) for out of network ATM transactions. I opened an account within a few minutes and never looked back. I have since (its been two years) moved my entire savings account balance over to this bank and am loving the interest income. In truth, I am actually saving more than ever simply because the money is in a different account/institution so i sort of forget about it. Who knew this was my solution to needing to save? I have not had an opportunity to need to call customer service yet, but if its as easy as the rest of my experience has been, I think it will be a breeze.",2017-01-25

I first heard about them when searching for a good savings account. So, I decided to see what they offered as far as savings options. I currently have several CD's at Synchrony. This rate is very competitive and I feel good knowing my money is in their hands. Since all their CD's from 6 months to 48 months are the same rate, I purchase 6 month CD's so I can take advantage of higher rates as they become available. With the market's steady improvement, I have found higher rates to be the case in a slow but steady manner. I have called customer service with questions, and I always receive prompt and courteous responses.

If you want and like a savings bank, you should visit their very user friendly website. There you will find all of their products.

I love their online banking section on their website as well. You can search through any transactions you want to go through and I love their budgeting tools that they provide!

Synchrony was especially favorable to me because I was looking to exit my big bank and head into something a little less cluttered. I was returning virtually zero from my bank, and I was sick of getting hit with 3% inflation every year. With Sychrony's rates, I can almost cut the effect of inflation by 50%, which makes quite a large impact when we are talking about 6-figures worth of funds. The only hurdle that I needed to get over was psychological - it's an online bank. Once I realized that banking with Synchrony was essentially the same as the way I was previously banking with my big bank (all online, all mobile), it was easier to get over the fact that there are no physical branches! Trust me, and just try Synchrony.",2017-01-06

The representative talked me through the various savings programs and helped me see how I could grow my money with a strong APY, which was very important to me as someone just starting a career. Synchrony's online interface also has the feel of a major bank and not a local bank. Synchrony allowed me to automate almost all of my monthly transactions, which has saved me a lot of time. It also allowed me to consolidate all of my savings and wealth growth options. I would recommend Synchrony to anyone who values speed and simplicity when conducting online banking business.",2017-01-03
2020,Synchronybank Review,26003,10480,Synchrony Bank,35017,5,"I've been wanting to open a savings account for a while now. I finally made the decision in April to open a Synchrony Bank account. I signed up for the High Yield savings account. They currently have one of the highest APYs I found. One of the things I love about this bank is that there is no fee to sign up and there is no minimum balance requirement. You can deposit as little or as much as you like. Their online account and mobile app are both extremely easy to sign up to use and navigate and all the necessary information you need is posted in your account. My customer service experience so far has been wonderful. I had a lot of questions about how a savings account works and if i'm able to access my funds if needed and they were very helpful answering all my questions before signing up. If you're looking for a savings account with great rates, there is no better choice.",2016-12-27
2021,One of the better banks for savings accounts.,25874,10480,Synchrony Bank,34744,4,I decided to go with Synchrony Bank for a savings account because it has one of the highest interest rates out there at the moment. So far I am not disappointed with the bank. It was easy enough to deposit the money online and start earning interest. They have a useful mobile app which lets checking your account and making transactions simple from your smartphone. Customer service was very helpful and easy to contact the one time I've needed them. The only part that I think other banks do better is having more resources online such as budget assistance and planning. They do have several other products which I plan to checkout like CD's and IRA's. Overall its been a good experience so far.,2016-12-15
2022,The Best Online Bank,25863,10480,Synchrony Bank,34720,5,"The fact of the matter is that you're wasting your money at ""big banks."" It's easy to tell yourself that you like the convenience, but when it comes to protecting your money from inflation, it's the percentage points that matter the most. I opened a savings account with Synchrony Bank with a great APY. Their interest rate is way above your average bank. How are you supposed to save your emergency fund, when you're losing it to inflation? It's impossible. I absolutely love Synchrony because of their rates, ease of withdrawal, and customer service. Whenever I have a question, I can get an answer within 10 minutes. The operators are always nice and they take your questions seriously.",2016-12-14
2023,Synchrony Hits The Mark,25790,10480,Synchrony Bank,34571,5,"I have had a savings account with Synchrony for almost 3 years now. I was told about them from a relative. I decided to give them a try after taking a look at their website. They have a high yield savings account, which means the interest rate that they currently give me is very competitive and very much one of the main reasons that I decided to go with them. I've never run into any problems at all. Customer service, if you ever need it (which I doubt), is on point ! Fees are nearly non-existent. They don't have any physical branches, therefore, they have hardly any of the overhead that the main banks do so they are able to have a very competitive products with super competitive rates. I can see myself sticking with Synchrony for many many years to come !",2016-12-07
2024,Synchrony Bank's savings rates are phenomenal in this current market,25772,10480,Synchrony Bank,34552,4,"I have shopped around for a great interest rate for a savings account and could not find anything worthwhile. Most of the rates were extremely low and the reviews for the bank's customer service and fees scared me away. One bank that stood out was Synchrony Bank. I didn't know much about them and didn't want to make a mistake so I took a while before I made the decision to open a savings account with them. I regret waiting so long; although the rate isn't super great, it is MUCH better than other banks out there. I love the mobile banking features and how easy it is to get in contact with a live person for assistance and guidance when needed. I definitely recommend Synchrony Bank.",2016-12-05
2025,Banking Made Easy.,25766,10480,Synchrony Bank,34545,4,Synchrony Bank is one of the best banks I've ever dealt with personally. Very secure and safe and I've never experienced any issues with them in terms of errors or bank issues. Their fees are very reasonable and the web and mobile experience is pretty good as well. I really have no complaints at all and their customer service rivals with some of the best. They have a lot of good things about them that set them apart from a other banks and it's a no brainer in terms of who you should bank with. Synchrony Bank is the choice and way to go if you ask me. I've been dealing with them for a year now and I've had no complaints whatsoever about them. I would recommend them to anyone I know.,2016-12-05
2026,satisfied customer,25764,10480,Synchrony Bank,34543,5,"I have been a Synchrony Bank customer for almost a year and a half now. I switched over from a regional bank that I had been using for nearly ten years. A friend told me they really liked Synchrony, but I was still skeptical. My initial concern was about depositing checks. My place of employment does not offer direct deposit, so I have to go to the bank every payday to deposit my checks so that I can have the money in my account as soon as possible. Because Synchrony is online, I was worried about a lag time between when I deposited the check and when it showed up in my account. After my first deposit, I was sold. The funds showed up in my account just as fast as they did with my traditional bank.",2016-12-03
2027,Synchrony is great,25763,10480,Synchrony Bank,34542,4,"Having two accounts through Synchrony bank is both convenient and easy. I am able to pay my bills, make transactions, and find different products that interest me. Being on only social security, I am able to use their services for my convenience and schedule. Any fees they have are very reasonable. If I want, I can buy a product from any online store and just put in my account information and it goes right through. If I need money for something or in an emergency the funds are put into my local bank within 2 days, which in my opinion is pretty fast. I must say I am very satisfied with their services and advice. I have never had a problem with them or any of their services. Their service people are always polite and answer with consideration for my age. I would recommend them to anyone.",2016-12-03
2028,Great Bank,25673,10480,Synchrony Bank,34296,4,"I started banking with Synchrony Bank about a year and a half ago. I was ready to drop my old bank because of their fees. I have been nothing but pleased since switching to Synchrony. It has made banking a lot easier. I do not have to go into a branch if I need something anymore. I can talk to someone on line and dll of my banking from the comfort of my home. I am able to check my balance, pay bills and do everything I could do with a physical bank; I just do not have to actually go to the bank. No more rushing to make sure I get there before they close; no more wasting my precious time waiting in line at a bank. It may seem like a small difference, but Synchrony Bank has made my life easier. I would suggest Synchrony Bank to everyone.",2016-11-30
2029,Tried it and really liked this bank,25647,10480,Synchrony Bank,34221,4,"I have banked with Synchrony bank for over a year now. The concept of an online bank with no regular branches and no real people to deal with made me a little worried. Now that I have banked with them, I can say with confidence that this is a great bank to work with. I like the convenience of doing business with them. Once, we had a concern about a banking experience with them, but the customer service was really good. They took care of it in a timely manner and resolved the issue. That made us more welcoming of this concept. We are looking to add more funds and types of accounts we have with this bank. If you are considering an online bank, I believe you will have a good experience like we did with Synchrony Bank.",2016-11-29

I came across Synchrony while searching for high yield accounts and immediately joined up. I have been happy with their rates as well as customer service. I had an issue with my computer but needed my 1099-int and the customer service representative was very helpful. We were able to get the information with relative ease. I recommend the bank to many of my clients who are looking for the same kind of services.,2016-11-22

Initially we were not sure due to the size of funds we were moving and looked at other options but decided to give this bank a try. We have been very satisfied with the experience we have had so far. Any problems have been resolved timely and the customer service has been really good. Of course being an online bank , their site is easy to navigate and get things done quickly. We have since moved more of our funds and looked into more kids of investment options we may explore with this bank. Over all a happy customer and would really recommend this bank to anyone looking to explore online banking.",2016-11-17

As it was getting closer to the end of date, I called to move my money to a different CD for 12 months. Instead of giving me terrible service the representative explained that I have a 21 day grace period to make any changes, which I think exceeds expectations for me. My interest rate during the 24 months was amazing and am pleased with there CDs compared to my local credit union.",2016-11-16
2033,Horrendous Customer Service,25511,10480,Synchrony Bank,33920,1,"I have TWICE have absurd trouble getting an IRA CD transferred from Synchrony Bank to another bank. Both times they came up with flimsy excuses why a check had not been sent to the new bank. Once they said I didn't identify the account number. When I asked them to overnight the funds, they charged me $25.00. I protested and had it kicked up to a higher level - and was refunded my $25.00 when they verified I had done everything correctly. Now I have been trying to get my husband's IRA transferred at maturity -- and twice was told all paperwork was in order. Now 1-1/2 weeks later they say ""well no it isn't"".

When I contacted them about starting a savings account they were extremely helpful and genuinely interested in telling me about the benefits of choosing them as a bank. This excellent customer service is the reason I decided to open an account with them and I have no complaints about doing so since! The only reason I wouldn't give them five stars is their user interface (on mobile, especially) could use more work, but it has gotten better.",2016-11-07
2035,Synchrony works for me,25433,10480,Synchrony Bank,33773,5,"While looking for a better place to earn some interest on my money than a traditional brick and mortar bank, I came across Synchrony Bank. I tried to apply to multiple banks, but the customer service individual at Synchrony Bank was the only one who was able to resolve my problem of having a less than ordinary address. They were able to guide me through a step-by-step process on how to set up my account, as well as provide information on the products that they offer. In addition to all this, Synchrony also offered a higher interest rate, although interest rates are at an all-time low, than its competitors. The only issue I have had with Synchrony is that they do not offer a mobile app for their bank. However, I can simply log on through the browser on my phone. They also send you an ATM card, which I have used without any problems, for free! I have yet to be charged with any surprising fees. All in all, I would recommend Synchrony Bank.",2016-11-03
2036,Better then Wells Fargo or BOA,25384,10480,Synchrony Bank,33671,4,"Having been screwed over and pushed around by the big names in banking for 15 years, I decided recently that I was sick of it, and it was time to switch. After a period when we were on vacation, a scammer got access to our Wells Fargo account and immediately ran up charges. Not only did it take 6 months of outright battling with Wells Fargo to fix things, we ended up having to pay nearly $4,000 so a lawyer could threaten them before they finally admitted it was their fault. Never again I said! <br/> <br/>We moved our savings over to Synchrony, and I have been so pleased with it. Sure there are occasional issues with the software and I struggle to figure out how to do things, but customer service is pleasant and tries their best to be helpful. I don't have to worry about them completely screwing me over, and direct mobile access to everything is really nice. I keep far better track of my financial position, because it is easier to do so. Online banks and banking are no longer a new fad, and many of the companies are established and well capitalized. Additionally, not one of them has begged Wall Street for a bailout, and since neither have I, these guys are right up my alley. Forget the big banks, and give a online organization a shot. I have been so pleased with mine!",2016-10-28

It is absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>They have increased the security to where it is cumbersome to log on. Their website is unreliable: it keeps giving messages about experiencing technical problems. So, you can't log in, sending the text or voice verification codes needed only works some of the time - and the error message tells you to call them. Good luck with that!<br/><br/>You have to verify yourself to the automated system.

I have been able to deposit money into the savings with no issues. Withdrawals from the money market were easy, too Customer service can be a toss up. I have been on the receiving end of great customer service and extremely poor customer service. I have been eyeing opening a CD with them.

The only fault I have with them is that their website feels a little clunky to use at times, but I don't really need to do much maintenance on it because I have the process automated.

Also, there is no service fee or minimum balance. They are also the only online savings account I know of that gives you an ATM card to access your money anywhere.

I have the confirmation email from Synchrony saying my request was submitted, they just haven't managed to actually do it in the past SIX DAYS!

You know what they said when I asked about this? ""It's a security feature."" Where's a wall? I need to pound my head against it. And the site is insanely slow.

My first constructive thought was that the website was great. It was extremely easy to navigate, and made me feel comfortable about what I was reading. The layout is logical. Things are listed under the headings that I expect, and the headings are just broad enough that I click/hover, just out of curiosity. I experienced no setbacks or problems while opening an account. It was very easy. A month or two later, my wife and I were interested in opening a CD for some extra funds that we were keeping for our first home. After checking out CDs at our local bank, we decided to open up a 2-year CD at Synchrony. The funds transfer was simple. I actually called ahead to make sure that I was allocating these funds correctly since it was a substantial amount of money (to us). The customer service could not have been better. To date, we currently have our growing savings account and a CD collecting a steady 1.25%.

I think online banks are the banks of the future, and Synchrony Bank is going to be at the top of the list. The thing I like best has been their responsiveness.

It was FDIC insured with a 1.05% APY. This was higher than any other bank I found.

What makes this bank better than traditional brick and mortar banks, and even other internet only banks, is it offers much better savings and money market rates. While it may only be 0.10 to 0.15% higher, that is still higher yield for the same safety you'd get anywhere else. And if you want CD rates, Synchrony has very competitive rates for short and intermediate term CDs.

They don't seem to care if I deposit money in the bank or not. Most unhelpful customer service ever! Check out the Traditional IRA transfer form. There is no room for a signature guarantee stamp, but the current custodian requires it. My bank providing the stamp says there isn't enough room.

Also, my saving account interest rate is high, and it is not dependent on how much money I have in my account. I opened a Money Market account for no charge, and it has worked well. I get .85% APY and am limited to 6 withdrawals. This keeps me from spending my money too much. When I need to use the money, I can easily use checks or the ATM. CD's from Synchrony are ok, but they have a fairly high minimum for the higher APY. Most of the stuff I need to do is not person-to-person, but person-to-technology, which I love.

I love the high interest my savings account earns (much higher than the measly .04% my local bank was giving me). They don't have any ATMs, but I've had no issues with ATM fees being refunded. Their app isn't the best, but at least it does show my account balance as well as perform some other basic functions. I expect some things to be skimped on to get such a high interest rate.",2016-06-30
2059,Painful Experience Trying To Open Up An Account.,24254,10480,Synchrony Bank,31018,1,"Truly a painful experience. The entire process of working with the bank is chaotic, unreliable, and painful. No one ever knows what is going on and there is no one to speak with who takes ownership and makes sure things get down. You can be in virtual limbo for weeks upon weeks, and nothing gets done. Well, I'm done with this bank. Far and away the worst bank I've ever dealt with.",2016-06-29
2060,Synchrony's High Yield Makes Sense,24246,10480,Synchrony Bank,31122,5,"We discovered Synchrony Bank's High Yield Savings about a year ago. At the time, our regular savings account from our local branch was offering less than 0.1% a year. We compared with other online savings including AMEX, and decided Synchrony had the best rate: 1.05% a year. That is more than ten times what our local bank was giving us, and without any annual fees. For us, the entire sign-up process was accomplished online with ease. Then transferring between our bank's checking account and Synchrony was simple and straight forward. The interest is added toward our principal on a monthly basis. The only drawback is the time for funds to clear. Once we submitted a transfer request from Synchrony to our own checking account, it can take up to three business days for the funds to be available. But unless you are always pressed for time, it makes sense to allow your money to earn more interest for yourself versus your local bank.",2016-06-28
2061,Consumer Friendly Bank,24196,10480,Synchrony Bank,30977,4,"I have used many other banks in my time, such as TCF or US Bank, but no other has compared to the service I have with Synchrony Bank. I have been with them for over 5 years now, and I have had an issue only once with a direct deposit not posting until 2 days later, but after I called them, she handled the issue and explained the delay for me, even giving me options on how to avoid issues next time. A very quick and efficient bank. I love their customer service because they make you feel important as a client and truly address your needs, questions, or concerns. I can't see myself doing my online banking anywhere else anytime soon.",2016-06-22

They offer great rates and make it very easy to access the money if ever needed. The best part of investing with this bank is the rates that they offer. The local banks do not compare. It is also easy to get a hold of representatives for assistance or even log-in online to access your account and make changes. I am very pleased with how competitive they are. I do wish that they would improve the website a little. It is decent, but should definitely be worked on to be as helpful as many other banks that I have seen. All pros and cons considered, Synchrony Bank is an excellent company to work with.",2016-06-16

Yes, I'm serious. Tried 3 times.<br/><br/>Finally got on, couldn't make a transfer. <br/><br/>20 minutes on the phone, I got a confirmation # and the rest. Two days later, site is down for maintenance, no return date mentioned.<br/><br/>All this after changing their EWP to a full year.",2016-06-15
2064,Best CD Rates around,24133,10480,Synchrony Bank,30811,5,"I had searched around for CD rates recently and online banks usually take the cake. I had heard briefly of Synchrony Bank in the past, but after doing some research (before I transferred them all my money), I was able to feel confident letting them hold my money for five years, the CD length I chose. Their website is up to date and I loved that I didn't have to go in there and sign papers etc. I checked out their FDIC status and they are insured for up to 250,000 per depositor which I don't come close to. My only complaint is that as an online bank I feel like it should have automatically set me up for e-statements. Instead I get a monthly paper statement about a five year CD.",2016-06-13
2065,Great Rates and Great Service,24114,10480,Synchrony Bank,30762,5,"I have been an account holder of Synchrony for the past year after looking for a better yielding savings account and CD for my cash reserves. I refuse to use brick and mortar banks because those banks offer horrendous rates. Synchrony's rates are some of the highest in the country even among peer internet-only banks. For example, their online savings account is 1.05% APY and is .3% higher than Capital One 360 and slightly higher than Discover/GoldmanSachs/Ally Bank. The benefit of Synchrony, though, is there is no minimum, so anyone with any amount can take advantage of these attractive rates. You can easily access the money by linking your standard checking account and transferring money only takes a few days, so it is extremely convenient. If you need help rolling over a CD or cashing out a CD, the online chat feature is quick and much easier than calling a customer service line (though you can call if you prefer). Either way, it is better than waiting in a line at a physical bank.",2016-06-11
2066,A Pretty Good Online Bank,24094,10480,Synchrony Bank,30726,4,"I ended up getting a bank account with Synchrony because I was in the market for another bank, having just left Chase where I was unhappy with their service and their fees. Synchrony's fees are understandable and are not implemented in every single place they can think of to try and get more money out of you. The savings account that I have even has a little bit better interest than the other banks that I have had in my past. This is big for me because I am trying to save for my future and, while it is not an ideal place to invest, am beginning here in my own bank until I get the handle of stock investing. All of my interactions so far have been pretty good. The initial woman I spoke to wasn't the greatest, but after I more clearly stated what I wanted, she was able to help me better. Everyone else has been great. I would definitely, and have, recommend this bank to other people.",2016-06-09
2067,5 Stars,24000,10480,Synchrony Bank,30468,5,"I have both a money market and CD account with Synchrony bank. At the time I was looking to open both accounts, they had the best APYs. The APY of a CD was what was most important to me. They also had plenty of options for the time frame or duration of the cd from short to long. It was easy to open my account. I love how I can check everything I need to online, and they are a member of FDIC. I did have questions, so I called customer service. They were very helpful, answered all the questions I had, were courteous and polite. I have recommended them to my family and friends. If I want to open and IRA, I will more than likely check them out first.",2016-05-28
2068,"Had problems opening account, but no issues since",23999,10480,Synchrony Bank,30467,3,"I have a high yield savings account with Synchrony bank that was opened late last summer. I chose to use Synchrony bank because of the higher interest rate than I could find elsewhere. I went through the process to open the account online, which was reasonably user-friendly and not too tedious, and tried to schedule an initial transfer to the account from my local bank. Everything looked fine when I logged out, but as I watched my accounts over the next week, I saw the transfer (and the necessary account verification) had not taken place. The two small deposits required for verification of my external account finally came through about a week after I filled out the online forms to open the account, but when I logged back into the Synchrony account, it would not allow me to input those numbers, and eventually said the external account was verified, but would not transfer my initial deposit. Finally, about two weeks after opening the account, I called customer service, and after the brief initial hold time, I was transferred to a representative who got it straightened out, although she did have to put me on hold to go talk to her manager, and apparently there was a problem with my address, so I was locked out of the online system. I haven't had any problems transferring money in or out of the account since, so it appeared to be an isolated start-up problem, and they did handle it professionally.",2016-05-27
2069,Synchrony Success,23832,10480,Synchrony Bank,30007,4,"I recently found myself banking with Synchrony Bank, and I could not be happier with the service I have received thus far. In the past year with Synchrony I have been very pleased with how quickly my deposits have been reflected in my account. For example, typically when I initiate a deposit, I will receive a message stating it will be about 5 business days until that is reflected in my available balance. However, this has not been the case even once throughout my time with this bank. I can happily say that my deposits are usually reflected the next day and at most two days after the initial motion has been made on my end. I am also very pleased with the customer service I have received while banking with Synchrony. If I have a question about my balance or a withdraw I did not make note of, I can simply call and always receive cheerful and helpful service from someone who can clear up any questions I have quickly. In summation, I will say that banking with Synchrony has been a pleasant experience and I am thankful to be working with them.",2016-05-13

2071,Synchrony Bank Review,23817,10480,Synchrony Bank,29992,4,"I decided to open a Synchrony Saving account, I have always used brick and motor type banks and decided to do all my saving banking online with Synchrony. Almost everything was done online except for a few things that I had to sign and send back. The application process was very easy and did not take much time at all. I was rather impressed with the saving account interest rate, it was the best I could find among any company. My interest rate is at 1.05% which is not great, but compared to the competition is pretty good. I will say that the online site could use some updating. It is not hard to use, but it could be better. My biggest complaint is that there is no mobile application. This is a huge disadvantage to me since I enjoy doing almost all of my banking via smartphone. I hope that this changes very soon. In addition, there is no capability to have person to person transfer. I know from some of my friends that there online banks have built in features like pop money. These are a few of the complaints but everything else has been great. I even had to call customer service one time, and the representative was friendly and handled my concern. The wait time was a little slow but nothing crazy.",2016-05-05

I tried online banking previously, but the interest rates were really low. I was able to link my existing checking account, and set up automatic transfer pretty easily. There's also an option of choosing if you want your transfers to be daily, weekly, bi weekly, or monthly. It's definitely helped me save for my individual taxes, whereas the savings account through my main bank takes out a monthly fee. Although minimal, it was frustrating to lose even the smallest amount of money that I planned on saving. Synchrony has the highest interest rates I've found so far. I have yet to have issues with the website and will plan to continue to use it in the future.",2016-05-03

When I retired from my job, I transferred my 401K to an IRA at Synchrony. I have a link between my local bank and Synchrony, so I can easily transfer money back and forth. I have had a couple of minor issues with the bank. The bank forgot to credit my account with $50 promotion for opening a CD account. I had to call them to remind them. When I wanted to take a distribution from my IRA, they send me the wrong forms to fill out. To their credit, they caught the mistake and contacted me to fix the problem. Their website is easy to navigate and I now know that I can download any form that I need. When I called them, I never had to wait long before I could talk to a customer service representative.

I needed a bank account that also offered a Visa or Master card. I looked around online and found them. I started talking to them online and they told me all about the perks they offered to their customers. I opened up my account. Two weeks into having the card I had no problem using the card anywhere. I got a text message from the bank. I called them and they told me one of the places that I used my card at had reported to them their credit information had been compromised. So they were going to need to reissue a new card to me. They kept my card available for me for a few days while they sent me a new card. That way I would still be able to get to my money.

After a little over a year, I am happy that I decided to make the switch. It's been very nice to see my account growing. The only problem that I have faced was the sign up and registration for my account. The online and over-the-phone customer service was average at best. They seemed to not be able to answer simple questions. Things linking accounts, withdrawing funds, and adding funds were a puzzle to them. Questions that should have been answered in a couple of minutes dragged out to over an hour! They were kind of unorganized. However, since setting up my account, I have not had any problems. The easiest way to deal with average customer service is not to deal with them! Synchrony has great rates, a great savings account, and should be used by everyone!",2016-04-05

It can't be done online if you want to link the accounts (mine and parents). They seem to be very confused on how to do it. It gets funded from a money market account held by Synchrony but you need to keep checking to make sure this actually takes place. Just because you tell them to take it out of the corresponding account does not mean it will actually happen. Some time they send a tax withholding form for signature other times they don't. I've asked why and they don't seem to know. Last month when I purchased my 2 CD's they sent a w/h form to sign for one and not the other. For the previous 8 CDs i didn't receive any. They seem very confused. If it wasn't for the very competitive rates I would probably not be wasting so much time dealing with them.",2016-03-30

Their customer service is always ready and willing to help and address any questions or concerns I have had. I love their online banking - I do almost all my banking online, so this service (provided free of charge), makes me extremely happy! Their website is highly resourceful and user-friendly. The fact that I've been with them for over five years without any problems or hiccups, should definitely speak to the character and integrity of the bank.

Then they wrote me that they cannot transfer my money to that account because it does not belong to me, and they informed me by regular mail, just 4 days before the new year - I could be in violation of the RMD requirement because of their error and needed to pay 50% tax fine.

One notable thing is that they do mail you paperwork to complete and mail back (at their expense) rather than fully complete the account opening process online. Once opened, it was easy to connect other bank accounts and transfer money between counts. I really like that I am currently earning a 1.05% interest rate where my former bank is at 0.80%. Customer service is easy to access by phone during regular customer service hours. When I called customer service because I got locked out of my account they were very friendly and made it easy to unlock my account by verifying my information.

Except they stopped payment on their own check. For two days, Synchrony denied stopping payment. Two days later I was told that they indeed stopped payment. They were willing to mail a new check but insisted they didn't make a mistake. They said they didn't stop payment on my check; they said they stopped payment on a check that had the identical number as my check. And they didn't compensate me fully for my lost interest. And they didn't apologize. And it took me about 10 hours to deal with their error. Beware of Orwellian banks like Synchrony.",2015-10-05

When I tried to close the first one at maturity, they completely messed up the closing, gave me bad information, promised to transfer the money to my personal account at another bank and then ended up mailing a very large check to my home. While we were out of town! So even though it was all set up to receive the money via wire transfer to my personal account, someone messed up and mailed the check instead. It will end up costing me about 2+ weeks of interest plus hassle. So even though their rates are the highest for my next CD deposit, I will NOT bank with them again. Take heed!",2015-09-07

I wanted to put it in a CD. I shopped online and used a comparison tool to find out the BEST CD rate for $2500 or less. Synchrony Bank Optimizer +Plus was called GE. At that time the percentage rate was 2 percent. The highest available to me as a civilian. The only other financial institution that had a higher rate was in Washington D.C. and had to be in the military to be a member.<br/> <br/>During the time that GE became Synchrony Bank Optimizer +Plus I was a bit worried but the online experience was NO problem whatsoever! I was almost shocked at the ease of transition. At one point I do remember calling the phone support and this time I WAS SHOCKED because I am so used to be put on terminal hold and pressing buttons all the time it was WEIRD to have a human right off the bat without even having to press '1' for English.

They pull customer contact information (phone numbers, etc.) from credit reporting bureaus (whose information is often outdated and inaccurate), instead of using the information that customers load into their profile. Consequently, was unable to complete a simple external bank account verification without endless calls to Synchrony's understaffed and poorly trained customer support department (endless waits on hold). They also prevent you from moving funds from one Synchrony account to another Synchrony account during the first 45 days. I've never encountered such an antiquated, outdated company. If my experience is any indication of how they run their business, I don't think they'll be around for long.

I could not bring the balance above that amount for a couple months, but I was able to contact the customer service and they immediately removed the additional fees for me. I have had to contact them for something as simple as a balance to more complicated items. Anytime I contact this company they are polite and prompt with helping me with all my concerns!

I was then informed that the website was down.<br/><br/>I later completed an account application with a rep on the phone and had to supply most of the info again. He indicated that the online app had been approved but he had deleted that account. He gave me a new account number and informed me that paperwork would be coming and that deposit(s) to my bank account would be made and that I would need to confirm those before electronic transfers could be made. I did receive the paperwork, returned it with a small initial deposit and that was confirmed by mail from them. However, no trial transactions had been made with my bank so I called them to complain. The rep said the account had never been set up for bank transfers. At that point, I ranted for a bit and asked that the account be closed and my deposit returned. Between wait times, online app typing, and actual phone conversations with reps, I estimate that more than an hour of my time was wasted.<br/><br/>In the midst of all this, I received an offer from Capital One that had a lower interest rate but with a bonus for sizeable deposits.

When I asked a question, they would basically just read from a script, not give me a legitimate answer. When I expressed that I was frustrated with the experience and frustrated they weren't acknowledging that I was upset, they would just repeat the answer that frustrated me in the first place. I work with a call center, so I get that calls can go bad, but I know it is never ok to throw such a rude attitude and talk down to callers. <br/>Then once I called back to try to get somebody else and to actually close the account, I expressed that I was treated completely rudely and the representative only said ""I'm sorry you want to close your account, are you sure about this?""<br/>Once I pay this off, I am done. I closed my account and I will never be using it again. I will be telling everybody I know to never use it, because it is horrible.

I tried reaching the bank over the phone but that's when I realized the horrible customer service they have. Like the previous review mentions, you will wait for at least 15 minutes or even longer. Then in my case the automated voice said, ""sorry the bank is closed at this time."" I mean really, then why make people wait? then I tried calling them during the normal business hours 2-3 times. Again wait for 20 minutes. A representative came online and couldn't resolve my issue so she took my information and said she will ask someone from other department call me. That someone has never called me back and I am still waiting. I tried contacting them via their online email message system 3 TIMES, still haven't heard from anyone yet.

The process to open an account was mostly straightforward. The only thing I didn't like about opening an account was that they mailed some paperwork to fill out and send back. Since they are billed as an online bank, I expected the entire process to be online. As far as fees go, they are very low or just not there. I have a high yield savings account and there's no regular fees at all. The interest paid is exceptionally good. They have a very high interest rate for the high yield savings account that I have been enjoying taking advantage of. Their customer service is very good. When I have been forced to call in with a problem, usually getting locked out of my online account, the banking rep on the other end of the phone has been very friendly. They've taking care of my issues quickly and made suggestions to prevent it happening again. The only thing I don't like about the bank is the website. It is clunky and doesn't flow well. It does give you the information you need, but not where you expect it to be. The log in process also just doesn't work well. I have locked myself out of my account more than once.

With Barclays, everything went off without a hitch. Seamless transfer of funds on the day they said they would transfer, and I am getting my interest transferred monthly to my outside checking account. This is being done perfectly. Synchrony is a different story. They said they would transfer the initial funds on a certain date. They didn't. I called 3 days later and they said they would pull the funds from my other bank that day or the next. They didn't. It took several calls and 15 days later and they FINALLY pulled the funds. I complained because that was 15 days I didn't get the higher interest rate from them that I was supposed to be getting. They said they would credit my account with the amount I should have gotten. That's great customer service!! But it didn't happen. It didn't even show up in my online account. I called again. Of course they were very apologetic.... They did whatever they needed to do, it showed up online, but it was in LIMBO. It wasn't added to my balance. It was just ""there"" as an amount. I figured I'd wait to see what happened when my interest was transferred over to my outside checking account. Well, that happened but that courtesy interest was left just sitting there doing nothing. It took another call for it to get transferred. Now I'm waiting to see if my interest is going to be automatically transferred at the end of the monthly cycle or if it's going to take several more calls to make this happen.

The CD rates were definitely the reason I opened my account and I have not found another bank that matches that. It's a great option for easy, short term investing. Let me also say that I love the online user interface. It's really easy to use. The website has made monitoring my accounts and getting customer service when I need it a snap. The customer service agents are quick to answer and very knowledgeable. A better experience than traditional banks, even.

Then when the funds were available they did not fund the CD immediately but said that the process of transferring the funds to the CD would take another 24-48 hours. CSR and supervisor ignored all my protests that this is not kosher, that all other banks I work with transfer funds from one acct to another, when they're available, immediately. In this instance not much money was at stake, but I had to show funds in certain accts by the end of the quarter. Supervisor refused to budge. ""This is the bank's policy.""

I was mostly looking for a high yield savings account. I used BankRate.com and found out that Synchrony Bank had almost the best yield available for a savings account. They were also highly ranked. I went to the website and looked to see what was required for an account. It was very simple, just your personal information and an opening deposit. I could even put a secondary owner on my account, which I like to do. I opened up the account online. The only thing they didn't do online was a signature form. They mailed me the form and I signed it and sent it back in the postage paid envelope. They transferred my opening deposit electronically and I added a couple of my other bank accounts to allow electronic transfers. Up to this point everything was really simple and straightforward. The only downside is that their requirements for your online password are so strict I can't seem to remember the password and I keep locking myself out. When you are locked out you have to call in and have an actual person reset your account. I tried to do the online reset but it claimed I didn't have the right information.

I had found them at Bankrate.com, offering this long term CD at a rate just under 5%. Those were the days! The customer service staff at that time was quite helpful, guiding me through the process of transferring an expiring IRA CD at my local bank and rolling it over into a CD at MetLife Bank. Everything went smoothly and my IRA enjoyed this high return until it expired last year. By that time MetLife Bank had become GE Capital Retail Bank. I had a few occasions to call them before my CD was to roll over again and the staff seemed to be the same as it was back when they were MetLife. The new rates were in line with the high end of what was available at that time, early last year. I decided to temporarily leave my IRA parked with them in a savings account earning just under 1%. During the last year the company has undergone another name change, now becoming Synchrony Bank, and their consumer account products marketed under the name of ""optimizer+plus"". From what i can tell from the account information regularly sent to me, the customer support department is still the same operation it was back when it was MetLife Bank, so I would have nothing negative to report on that end, as I always found the staff there to be knowledgeable and helpful. Lately I have seen advertising aggressively marketing their consumer accounts under the new moniker and their rates seem to parallel the high end of what is presently available in their niche. If you are seeking safety with a relatively high return and good customer service, a Synchrony Bank ""optimizer+plus"" account might just work for you. <br/> <br/>Synchrony Bank offers no branch banking as far as I know, at least in my area, but the bank's website (www.myoptimizerplus.com/banking/index.htm) is very user friendly with all necessary information readily available. I would recommend, however, utilizing the very efficient customer service department (1-866-226-5638) if you are thinking of opening an account with them, as they will be able to answer all your questions and guide you through the process.",2015-01-07

The problems that I have experienced have been few and far between, but when an issue arises, their customer service reps actually seem to care about me and have always worked diligently to correct whatever the issue is and to make sure that I'm completely satisfied.

Process a little mysterious, no apparent activity for about 4 days, but presto, all went smooth. Then transferred a little from all external accounts. They claim 1-3 business days (apparently for us that really means 3...). Money in smooth. After the fact I discovered various review sites complaining that transferring money out was impossible, so... initiated a small transfer out. 3 days later, money appeared in external account. Registration, customer service, account setup, money transfer in AND out all work great. As far as I can tell, we've exercised all the important moving parts and they all function as advertised. Overall I'm quite pleased with Synchrony. If you have issues with this bank, it's more than likely self-inflicted.

After speaking with a tech, the CSR said the tech could find nothing wrong and issued an account number immediately. <br/><br/>** Time-wasting activity: When I created my application, the site had me choose an ID and password. However, when logging on for the first time, the site made me change my password. The next day, the site made me change my password AGAIN.<br/><br/>** Least helpful CSR response: I sent a message via secured mail about the password problem. I was told 1) not to confuse my passwords with each other, and 2) I had to call in order to get help.<br/><br/>** The final straw: When I called, the CSR asked if I had certain special characters in my password. I said yes, since the instructions require at least one special character. She said some characters had been allowed, then disallowed, then allowed, etc. She said the problem was being fixed, ""as we speak."" There were no instructions on the site explaining any of this, and my password was always accepted as valid. This password issue spanned several days.

As they requested I followed up by providing a message verifying the routing number and account information and CIT says they will handle it from there. Unless something unforeseen occurs, I expect to see those funds post to my other account shortly after maturity. Many folks seem to want better online rates but don't want to deal with online transfers. Part of the trick is to be prepared and have your game plan for transfer in place a week or two before your CD maturity date.

There’s no online option to schedule the transaction either in advance or at maturity. And when you call, you have to first transfer the funds to a non-CD internal account - which takes 1-3 business days! - and then transfer out - another 1-3 business days. Meaning your money is tied up 2-6 business days AFTER it matures. No other repository that I’ve worked with, online or Brick&mortar, works this way. Unacceptable for my purposes and suggests to me that perhaps this institution is more of a commercial banking operation than a consumer bank.

2155,Customer Service Is Dirt,37520,11926,CIT Bank,59334,1,"This is my first time banking with CIT. I’ve deposited several thousand dollars into a savings account with them over the last 2-3 months. Now, it’s time to get my money and IT HAS BEEN SO DIFFICULT. It takes SEVERAL days to get your money from them (been trying for 6 days now). I’m used to banking where when I submit a wire transfer request, I get a call within a few minutes verifying the request. Then the bank sends my money where I need it to go *within the hour*.<br/><br/>Here, they take DAYS. There was a problem with a wire and I called them first thing in the morning to check on it. The guy was like “oh our wire department has only been open for an hour but I’m sure everything is fine and they will be in touch with you soon.” OK-- BUT THEN I DIDN'T GET A CALL BACK UNTIL IT WAS “TOO LATE TO SEND MY WIRE THAT DAY”. Are you kidding me?? You can’t do business like this. They only accept wire transfer requests from 8:30am until 10:30am. After that you have to wait until the next day. These operating hours are a joke! Most banks have a wire cut off time of 2:30 or 3:00pm. <br/><br/>If you’re going to have terrible operating hours, CALL ME TO SORT OUT THE PROBLEM BEFORE ITS TOO LATE! I’m used to moving millions through banks each month and NEVER have they pushed something off until it was “too late” to handle it that day. I’M PAYING WITH A WIRE TRANSFER BECAUSE *OBVIOUSLY* IT’S URGENT. Why would you push it off like it’s unimportant??<br/><br/>Also the mobile app has very limited options. Most things must be done through the full website which is stupid considering the company prides itself on it’s mobile banking abilities that supposedly set it apart from traditional banks.<br/><br/>In sum: Go to a brick and mortar bank with a banker you can form a relationship with. This online crap where you speak to someone different every time you call or need help is a joke. Also, those people don’t care about you at all. They don’t know you. They don’t want to know you. Once you hang up the phone, you’re no longer their problem because they don't require their employees resolve issues themselves and they don't send out a survey afterwards where you can grade the employee who helped you. This leads to extremely poor service because no one is held accountable.<br/><br/>I urge you, *urge you* to go to a bank where you can form a real relationship with them. Then people will help you when you need it. CIT BANK is a joke. Your financial life is important. Having access to your money can mean the difference between closing a deal or losing a deal, or getting hit with late fees, or finance charges, or you might even default on a loan if you bank with CIT Bank... and it’s all because they decided they didn’t care enough to release *your* money that *you* worked hard for on the day you requested it.",2019-05-30

I have never had this happen with a bank before – always got a notification that the CD is maturing by mail or email. They said there was nothing they could do about it and I should have know when my CD was maturing.

Issue NOT resolved. Just read many online reviews of similar situations and am discouraged. We have a five year jumbo cd with CIT that expired two weeks ago. I have been waiting for the check of $111,000 approx to be received. We are currently in FL for the winter, until next week. I phoned CIT prior to coming to FL the end of Dec to assure CD was squared away. Was given options of roll over, wire transfer, mail check etc upon due date. I said I wanted MAIL CHECK. customer service said no record of me calling and made me feel like I was lying. I have no email at xxxxxxxx except MONTHLY STATEMENTS, I was told by customer service rep that our mail from CIT has been returned since FEB. our mail was to be transferred to winter FL address but apparently CIT mail was returned to CIT. Thus any mail letters From CIT regarding the CD, or the check, were returned. CIT told me this. Now CIT wants to charge us $1950 to early terminate the NEW 5 YEAR CD we did not authorize or want. I have asked to please send our money back explaining that I had set up this NON RENEWAL CASH OUT when I called in Dec but they say I did not call. They now have our money in a low rate 5 year cd and are holding it hostage unless WE pay a penalty of $1900ish when clearly they see we did not get mail in recent months regarding anything from CIT, and they suspiciously say we did not call in Dec which I did to assure this financial issue was taken care of while we were out of state for winter. I called today because we hadn't received the check yet, and knew the CD came due by mid March. Very disappointing. I would like this elevated and resolved asap.

2163,Worst Experience Ever,36639,11926,CIT Bank,56787,1,"After seeing their great rate advertised on this site, I was hopeful this would be a great way to save money. However, after reading several bad reviews on this site, I decided to test it before making a large deposit (thankfully). So I opened a savings builder at 2.45% with the minimum $100 and made 2 more $100 deposits in 1 months time. Yet they held my 3rd payment until it was past the monthly cut off, and instead, it was deposited 1 day after their supposed cut off, therefore pushing my account down to the lower rate of a mere 1%. I called twice and the woman I spoke to first said they would honor the higher rate and it would be shown on my account effective immediately. I checked online later that day and it was still showing the lower 1% rate. I called again and they had no recollection of this. In fact, they tried to pretend they didn't know anything about the first call, then admitted there was a note on the account, but nothing about honoring the higher rate. The agent and his manager straight up told me that they would not honor the rate. I closed the account, and I am worried my money will disappear (thankfully it's only $300 but still). This proves that they never intended to honor the higher rate and it's just a scam, hoping people don't notice, designed to steal money. They need to be forced to run an ethical business or be completely shut down from Banking.",2019-03-14
2164,My Experience,36586,11926,CIT Bank,53032,4,"I would like to comment on my experience with this bank, as it matches up with some other comments that I have read. First off, the account opening procedure was very easy. Some banks make you jump through hoops to join them, but not this bank. The problem started for me when I didn't completely understand the ""available balance"" number in the App and also why I couldn't verify what I had done online. CIT basically locked me out online, giving out bogus choices to send ""security codes "" but i'm now reading they pretty much do this to everyone. I had to call and request a call back so that I could access my account online (other than the weak app). The ""available balance"" bothers me, but I have proved (and they confirm as well) that interest does indeed start accruing when the deposit is posted, not when it becomes available. Its a very strange setup, should be available the next day. Oh well. Finally I tested my first withdrawal 2 days ago, and the money was in my other bank the next day! So that's definitely a positive. In summary, this bank is definitely quirky, and may not be for the feint of heart. But as long as they continue to be an interest leader, i'll deal!",2019-03-07

I had to call back a 3rd time and keep pushing through their BS before a manager would expedite the request for me. So don't put your money here if you plan on actually using it.

I saw that CIT Bank was offering 2.45% on balances over $25,000 or if you make one transfer a month into the account of $100 or more. I opened an account and got started and transferred my money in. The web interface is a bit dated, reminds me of the old American Express personal savings interface and some others as it's through i-bankingservices (which apparently hosts many banking interfaces for various banks). The website is very clunky. To locate my account number, I had to go retrieve a document that was posted to my account when I opened it. There's no place else to retrieve the account number. I also noticed no place that had the routing number either.<br/><br/>Since I initiated my transfer via CIT Bank (and didn't push it from an external bank) the money shows on my account but would not be available for up to five business days. This was made clear on the website, however, I have been attempting to contact customer service for the last three days to find out when my funds will be available and it's IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of anyone. There is no online chat feature, I sent a message on the online portal but this takes multiple days to receive a response and waiting on hold for 1+ hours is unacceptable to me. This isn't worth the aggravation for a measly ~0.2% APY. I had high hopes for CIT Bank but this experience has been very disappointing. They claim their customer service is like this because of the interest in the savings builder account yet many reviews speak very badly about their customer service. It also seems like CIT Bank is known to create ""new"" savings accounts every so often with better rates and not update the interest rates for existing account holders. <br/><br/>I have decided to leave CIT Bank for Ally bank as my experiences with them in the past have been excellent, they're very easy to get ahold of and their online interface is one of the best I have seen. Proceed at your own risk when signing up for a CIT Bank account.",2019-01-30

But with CIT I get to an operator quickly and one who has the answers and can help me the first time in an outstanding manner. I have received quick courteous service a number of times.

For the most part, I have had a positive experience. I can recommend CIT easily. <br/><br/>My constructive critique would include: 1) Please add the capability to title an account with a revocable Trust name. Most people with substantial size accounts need to keep these accounts inside of a personal Living (Revocable) Trust. Note: a number of competitors do permit Trust accounts. 2) I could not rate the web experience with more than 2 stars because there are a few software glitches in the web product that make navigation on the website difficult.

2172,We Gave Up After 3 Calls,36196,11926,CIT Bank,55538,1,"My wife and I set up a joint account to contine aggressively saving toward a down payment on a home. We linked our savings accounts from our other two financial institutions. It took several days to get them up and running because you have to verify two separate micro deposit/withdrawals. Every time you log into your account, you have to verify your identity with a code that is either delivered by text or by phone call. It was a little annoying that the codes could only be sent to me even though it was a joint account (or at least that’s what customer service told us). My wife wanted to get everything up and running ASAP and I would get texts at work knowing my wife was attempting to get the accounts linked. The problems started occurring when we tried to link our checking accounts so we could automatically send money over to CIT after every paycheck. Even though we had no problem verifying the micro deposits for our old savings accounts, CIT kept saying the amounts we were entering when attempting to link our checking accounts were incorrect. An error message would pop up with a phone number to call. We called this number 3 times over the course of 3 weeks. Every time we were on hold for 45 minutes to an hour before speaking to anyone. The first time, the agent said my wife had to create her own online banking profile that is also linked to the account. Not quite sure why. They still text my phone with a verification code every time a transaction is attempted. On the second call, they told her to delete the profile the first agent told her to create. Still unable to verify our checking accounts. Finally, we called them a third time and the agent told her to try again since the only possibility was that we were putting in the wrong numbers. I hope the two of us aren’t dumb enough to plug in the wrong numbers multiple times after acing it on our first two savings accounts. We said this was the third time we were told to try it again and were wondering if there was another way to link the accounts. Even a paper form requiring a notary would’ve been a better option at this point. The agent told us there was no other way to link the accounts. It’s unsettling to have large amounts of cash tied up in an online bank that has such a poor user experience. My wife was upset that the website said to call customer service to aid in verifying the accounts and they apparently can’t actually do that. We were so annoyed that we immediately set up an order to empty the CIT account back into our old accounts. We set up a Goldman Sachs Marcus account and linked all our bank accounts in 5 minutes. 5 minutes vs 3 weeks. This was our original plan but CIT lured us in with the marginally higher APR. The agent on the last call said if we couldn’t figure out how to link our checking accounts, we could make deposits by mailing checks.",2019-01-19
2173,A Rare 2Nd Chance But Be Extra Careful,36173,11926,CIT Bank,43773,2,"I'm giving CIT Bank a rare second change after their initial horrid first impression. However my guard is up and I'm incredibly wary as they have concocted intentionally complex and confusing terms (see: https://www.cit.com/cit-bank/tiered-savings-account-savings-builder-direct/).<br/><br/>Their Savings Builder account is a rate leader if you qualify for the 2.45% APY. Unlike their disastrous No Penalty CDs, this account remains liquid and I can transfer the money out at the drop of a hat. Here is where you must be careful though as they may ""steal"" your interest from you if your timing is off<br/><br/>From my understanding, if you transfer your money out before the 25th of the current month you'd still earn 2.45% APY at the end of the current month provided you had a deposit of $100 or balance of $25k on the 25th of the PREVIOUS month. However, any money that comes back into the account will be at the lower rate until the 25th of the next month when it will be re-evaluated.<br/><br/>Their ACH pull service seems to be decent with money appearing in my current balance the next day regardless of source but I'm watching carefully.",2019-01-17
2174,Update From 1/17 With A Positive Outcome (See Comments),36167,11926,CIT Bank,55493,4,"Here's what I wrote to this bank in their message center, on their FaceBook page, and in a tweet (impossible to get through by phone). It says it all.<br/><br/>You have made an egregious error in attempting to transfer two deposits from my external account. I AUTHORIZED ONE withdrawal from that account. Now, since you have attempted to withdraw TWO deposits the bank has notified my that my account is overdrawn: ""Your account is overdrawn... If you do not make a deposit on time, any checks, transfers or bill payments from your account will be returned unpaid. One Insufficient Funds Fee is assessed each day items are returned unpaid.""<br/><br/>You MUST correct your error, DO NOT attempt to withdraw the second amount -- that is UNAUTHORIZED. I will also expect CIT Bank to pay any penalties and fees associated with your error.<br/><br/>I expect resolution tomorrow, January 17. How completely and quickly you fix this mess you created will determine whether I stay with the bank.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, I could not be more disappointed, and I cannot believe you have behaved in such an incompetent manner.",2019-01-17

Two days of trying to get through on the phone to verify my new account with no success. Recording says if you leave a number they'll call you back, but they don't. I've e-mailed customer service and gotten a reply that it'll take 2-3 business days to respond. All I want to do now is cancel my account application. No matter what interest rate they offer, it's simply not worth the time or aggravation of dealing with second-rate customer service.",2019-01-13

2177,Worse Experience EVER,36083,11926,CIT Bank,55303,1,"I opened the account and made the two mini deposits to make sure it worked. All was well. I then transferred a significant deposit from my home bank and instead of taking it once that took it TWICE. Needless to say, I didn't have enough money to cover this mistake. My checking account was at a negative balance for thousands of dollars. My local banker tried to contact CIT and they told him they had some problems which allowed this to happen. They at no time offered to return the second deposit. I have been on hold for HOURS trying to get in contact with CIT. They do not return the phone call or have they responded to a text message I made 24 hours ago. <br/><br/>I don't care what their rate is, I have spent more time on this than any interest I would have made in a year.<br/>After 24 hours I now have $74 in overdraft charges.

When I call them to resolve the issue I get the dreaded "" we are experiencing very heavy call volume"" so I request a call back. When a company gives you a recorded message that says this, what they are actually saying is we don't care enough about our customers to respond to you in a timely manner.

2180,Poor Customer Treatment,35748,11926,CIT Bank,54408,1,Rather than increasing Money Market rates for existing customers CIT advertises higher rates and requires existing customers to sign up for a new account to receive the higher interest rates. I have had an account since 2015 and assumed each time I saw a higher interest rate advertised that I was getting the benefit of the higher rate. NOT SO!<br/><br/>They are currently advertising 2.25% for money market accounts.....yet my account is only receiving 1.05%. When I confronted them they advised that I had to sign up for the new 2.25% account to receive that interest rate. Of course they had not bothered to communicate that. I also have accounts at Barclays and Marcus and they automatically increased my interest rate to their advertised rate when they raised rates. <br/><br/>This Bank does not value existing customers!,2018-11-24

Documentation of accounts is substandard - better hope you never have to make a claim - because you’ll have only piecemeal data that won’t hold up to any scrutiny. <br/>4. You can put your funds in a CD, but getting them out, even at maturity, is a virtual minefield of obstacles. There is no online option. There is no call in<br/>option. Send them a “secured message” but even that won’t work.<br/><br/>Management is responsive, but that takes way too much effort - customer service and access are just poorly designed, and until it gets completely overhauled, look for competitive rates and much user-friendlier banking at other institutions.",2018-11-07

Ridiculous!",2018-10-12
2183,CIT Bank Is Very Good If You Don't Mind The Really Minor Hoops To Jump.,35274,11926,CIT Bank,47762,5,"I've been very pleased with CIT Bank. It is one of the 6 different online banks I've banked with for the last 2.5 years. I have a pretty good feel now for what I can expect with some online banks. PurePoint Bank and CIT Bank are pretty much now the only banks I deal with online and I have since dropped the other 4 banks. PurePoint and CIT Bank offer among the highest available interest rates from banks that are sizable enough for me to feel safe with, and who has a good track record with customer service, as I don't want my money at a bank that I have to fear getting hacked, or having trouble accessing my money. Nor do I want to bank with an institution that is financially on shaky ground. I have once before transferred $75K out of CIT Bank via ACH, and the process was complete in 18 hours without a hitch and left me feeling very comfortable about doing business with them. With comparing the 2 banks, Pure Point is proactive and usually among the fastest of the large banks to increase their rates to 2.15%, and they do it for you voluntarily, while CIT Bank on the other hand took only a few days longer to increase their rates, and they might make you call them so that you have to jump through small hoops to get it. While CIT Bank did automatically raise my rates for me the last time around some months back to 1.85%, I had to call them this week to get their new higher 2.15% rate. Don't be surprised when CIT Bank (or any other bank) raises their rates substantially, and you find that their phone lines are tied up for over an hour. I had to call and leave my tel number twice with them. On the 2nd attempt the next day, they did call me back within 7 minutes. They are always very friendly and patient. They instructed me to open the new ""Saving Builder"" account with them to get the higher 2.15% rate. Because I already have an account with them, the process was very fast and easy. You merely go into your existing account and click on the green box to request a new account. You don't change your user name or password. The website page guides you along so that the process is simple, and once you are already a client with this bank the process should remain just as easy for you with any other future rate increases they may have.",2018-10-11
2184,Has Potential To Be Better,35026,11926,CIT Bank,53101,3,"I have been a customer of CIT bank for almost a year now. I was drawn to their competitive savings rate, and no penalty CD rate. I also have accounts with several other online banks, including Ally so I am able to compare each for myself. Let me first start off by saying the customer service at CIT bank is outstanding. Every representative I have talked to is very polite and helpful. Each time I have had to close, or fund a new account, it has been a smooth process. *Knock on wood* However, the process of having to pick up the phone each time I want do this is the part I don't like. I rather do this myself with the ease of my computer or phone. For example, Ally has that option where I can personally close my no penalty CDs and immediately fund the new one. With CIT, I cannot close anything, hence a phone call. Also with the CIT mobile app, it is very basic and doesn't offer much other than a snapshot of my accounts. Ally offers a detailed app with several other features. I can also track the up to date interest on my no penalty accounts. CIT only gives me the interest information by the month. I also noticed CIT has a longer hold on incoming funds from outside banks, than with any other online bank I used. This why I choose not to add any additional funds into CIT. If CIT were to make the necessary changes, I would probably do so. However, their rates are competitive so I'll keep what I have with them for now.",2018-09-14

2186,Decent Rates But...,34859,11926,CIT Bank,52710,1,"Access to money in the accounts are attrocious at best. ie: funds immediate clear your source bank (wire or ACH) for deposit into CIT. Though it may show a couple of days later as transferred in your CIT account, funds are not made available in CIT till up till a week later. So you are dead in the water if you need access to YOUR money during these periods. There is no check writing also and electronic transfers out can take a few days. These holds make zero sense and until they fix this I will not be depositing any more funds into CIT. Not worth the extra .05%... In summary, if you need quick or easy access to YOUR money stay away.",2018-08-27
2187,Dated Online Baking UI,34720,11926,CIT Bank,52350,2,"Everything designed on Cit Online banking is counter-intuitive. It's looping you around to find simple information like your account #. Once you dug in deep to find account #, you had to go to their main Cit website's FAQs to find their Routing #. If you're a frequent online / mobile banking user, with experiences with Discover etc, these inconveniences at Cit takes your each step back. Also, their message center doesn't work. They wouldn't reply me timely, and I couldn't write more message on their msg center, simply couldn't find the write new button anymore. I had to call back to see whether this bank legit or not, and here came to the worst: An easily frustrated representative - question your questions and robotic, put you on hold when she got frustrated. The rate appears good right now, but you can find competitive rates easily this month at other institutions. Keep in mind, Cit claims 5 days hold for any types of accounts, unlike Discover that your fund gets interest compounded soon after you deposit, you lose 5 days and it doesn't include weekends.",2018-08-07
2188,No Robust System To Support Transfer Money Between Accounts And Fund Accounts,34710,11926,CIT Bank,52325,1,"CIT ban has great advertising and very attractive rates for their Money Market and CD accounts. However they do not have robust system that supports opening these accounts, transfer money between accounts and fund these accounts. Their IT department is way behind with the online and mobile application. They are simply not ready for it. For example, the online application does not allow to fund CD account(s) from your Money Market account. You have to add your MM account as an external account, go through the verification process and then transfer the funds as from an external bank (even though it is happening within the same bank). Obviously this is serious logical flaw. The other work around process is to call customer support and ask for “issue a physical check” from your MM account to your CD. This so ridiculous to me. On top of it, the application puts 5 business hold on the funds even though the money comes from an account within the same bank. Customer service people are quite friendly. But, on few occasions provide confusing and inaccurate information. Personally, I think they have a long way to go if they wish to become a normal user friendly online bank.",2018-08-06

No only is the online banking software lightyears BEHIND Ally's, I've now been waiting a week for my CD to be closed.<br/><br/>When it finally does close I will reevaluate my CIT accounts and see if there's another place for my money. I don't feel it should be my job to check the rates and status everyday and I'd really be in a horrible spot if I needed the money quickly. I originally was closing the NP CD to move my 1 year CD ladder over to CIT bank since they're offering a decent rate there.

2198,CIT-the Best Place to Keep Your Money,33889,11926,CIT Bank,50739,5,"I actively use a ""Money Market"" account with CIT. I was allured to this account due to their 1.75% APR offered for this style account. When I heard about this I instantly made an account and transferred my savings over. Creating and activating the account was seamless. Linking my numerous other accounts to transfer my savings was also quite simple. All-in-all I had everything up and running in about an hour's worth of work. I very rarely withdraw from this account, but on the occasion I do I typically receive my money in the same week. Depositing is quicker, typically taking a few business days. I regularly receive payments for accruing interest, which is automatically placed back into the account. In conclusion, the 1.75%APR is the highest I have seen for any savings style account. It would be great financial practice for one to take their money and store it in this account and watch it grow.",2018-05-24
2199,"Ramp-Up, Rip-Off",33928,11926,CIT Bank,50798,1,"Two years ago, I knew interest rates had nowhere to go but up, so I bought several of the Ramp-Up and Ramp-Up Plus CDs. The ""ramp-up"" refers to potential beneficial rate increases, if they occur, and the stated rate cap cleverly makes you believe you've considered all of the risks (it's double the original rate minus a nominal amount like .05%). Now, while many other banks are offering rates at least 1% higher than the 1.67% rate I locked in, my rates are going nowhere. In fact the rate for new investors is actually going down! This sneeky marketing come-on requires you to ask, ""What index are the variable rates based on,"" and the answer to that is, ""nothing"" but what the bank views as the ""market."" So in other words, even if the Fed Funds or LIBOR rate goes up or mortgage rates or Treasury yields go up, this bank is under no obligation to increase their rates on the Ramp-up products because their criteria is something only they are privy to. Additionally, the 1-year early withdrawal penalty on 3+ year maturities is substantial, and although I must have accepted it when completing the forms, the customer service rep I called today said the bank isn't required to disclose it over the phone unless asked--only in the agreement you accept when purchasing the CD.

Their savings and checkings accounts didnt offer much in interest but was on par with many other financial institutions. Dealing with people in person was a good experience with few if any issues. But customer service over the phone was lacking. I found the customer service representatives were no as helpful as what was expected of me and were not fully knowledgeable in the way i expected.,2018-05-14
2201,Great Savings Product,33743,11926,CIT Bank,50541,5,"The Cit Bank saving is a great product. It was giving a 1.55 percent interest rate which is one of the best for a saving account. I wish it had a checking account also but the saving account is great for an emergency account. It's website is easy to go to. Joining was not hard neither was funding the account. The only bad thing is I can only withdraw from my account 6 times a month, but as I am using it as an emergency account that limit helps keep the money in the bank and not spending it.",2018-05-12
2202,CIT Mmarket,33709,11926,CIT Bank,50498,5,"I am an online banker and hate having to go to branches.<br/>I opened this account with no issues in 3 minutes. I called customer service before that to test response time and made a view complicated questions related to wire and funding the account. I spoke with a person in less than 2 minutes. In 3 different calls I received info I needed in less than 3 minutes. That's a 5 star already.<br/>The safety features on the account are better than Chase Bank and to safe on wire transfer fees to fund your account just set up external account on Cit Bank , wait once it is confirmed and request to wire money from CIT to your bank. If over $25000 its free or $9 per wire. You wire 1 time!!<br/>My Chase bank allows to wire out max $25000 x day. Thats insane and cashing in $25 x wire. Cit bank allows you to wire max 2 Million x day and free. Plus now your money earns something while sitting there and being used by the banks. 1.75% is better than 0.01 % from Chase. And you can use the money max 6 times a month. For me this is perfect. Let's see how long this rate stays.",2018-05-07
2203,Not Too Shabby.,33670,11926,CIT Bank,39100,4,"Opened a CIT savings a couple months ago. Just recently opened a money market to take advantage of higher rates. Most recent transfer took only one business day. I like the revamped website. Had to call customer service for a small issue, which was handled efficiently. No complaints. Will keep doing business with CIT as long as the rates remain competitive.",2018-05-03
2204,No Problems Opening An Account,33632,11926,CIT Bank,15671,4,"I opened a large account about a month ago. I have been with SallieMae Bank for years but at the time their rate was 1.50% and CIT was 1.75% with the amount in my account that made a real difference. Some features I liked; as many beneficiaries that I wanted, no outgoing wire fee (if account over 25k), high limits on ACH transfers (2M) Opening was straightforward. over 25k). <br/>Time will tell how good they are.",2018-04-27
2205,Deceptive And Poor Service,33152,11926,CIT Bank,50215,1,"This bank is a sham. You notice they advertise 1.75% APY (as of April 2018), in competition with other bank rates....but what they don't make clear is this is for a money market account and their competitors are online savings interest rates. On top of this, I DID have a high yield savings account which was a full 0.7% less than adverstised. When questioned on this I was told this is because they never informed existing customers...who are expected to navigate through the promotional deceptive hooks and find the real truth. GO elsewhere, Goldman and Barclays are far better rates, more sound banks. Don't fall for the gimicks.",2018-04-22
2206,Stay Away From This Cheater!,33107,11926,CIT Bank,10070,1,"They'll lock your account's interest rate(even for their savings account) to the rate when you open the account. If their rate goes down, they'll lower your rate. However, when their rate goes up, they'll keep your account at lower rate until you call them to request a interest rate raise. After I figured out their tricks, I moved all my funds to Goldman Sacks Bank and Ally Bank.",2018-04-16
2207,Easy to use and great rates,32839,11926,CIT Bank,49800,4,"I signed up for a savings account here because of the fantastic rates. I was trying to create a joint account with my spouse. Unfortunately, the web application was very confusing. I ended up having to add her after the fact and this was a bit of a hassle. They had to speak with her over the phone and it took several additional days to complete the process. Overall, we have been satisfied with the account. I do wish that we had received ATM cards in case of an emergency need to access funds.",2018-04-14
2208,My Experience With CIT Has Been Good,33009,11926,CIT Bank,20615,5,"I'm posting not to invalidate the recent bad experiences people have reported, but to share my counterexample.<br/><br/>I have had CIT savings, CDs, and money market accounts for over a year. I've had to call into customer service a few times -- like when rolling an existing no-penalty CD into a new no-penalty CD with a higher rate. All of those experiences have been very good for me. I did not have a very long wait on the phone. The customer service rep was knowledgable and walked me through the process very easily and quickly.<br/><br/>I have had no trouble getting money into or out of my CIT accounts from a couple different linked bank accounts (credit unions).<br/><br/>I don't know if this is all a case of good versus bad luck or what, but I've been very pleased with CIT so far.",2018-04-13
2209,Horrible Account Management And Service,32825,11926,CIT Bank,49786,1,"I thought I would try CIT bank due to its relatively good interest rate. It seems like a legit bank since it has been in existence for a few years.<br/><br/>I can not contact CIT by phone due to being on hold for over an hour. CIT also does not respond to the message I posted 5 business days ago about the inability to transfer funds from my bank.<br/><br/>The initial external transfer of $1000 worked when I seeded the CIT account. The external bank is listed as ""Active Ready for External Transfers"" in my CIT account but when I attempt an external transfer I get the message ""No transfer accounts found. Please contact us for assistance.""<br/><br/>I no longer have confidence in the bank and want to close my account. How do I reclaim my $1,000 initial deposit when I cannot link to my external account? Hopefully money will eventually transfer back to my external account as easily it transferred into the CIT account.",2018-04-12
2210,The Worst Of The Worst...Stay Away!!!,32804,11926,CIT Bank,642,1,"My previous experience with this bank was a red flag--high come on savings rates and then a quick, huge and unannounced drop in the interest rate. Caveat emptor: You need to always be checking or you will be very unhappy.<br/>A few weeks ago I thought I would open an account for some CDs...at least they could not pull the same stuff with a fixed rate investment. Was I wrong.<br/>Their site said they review applications and the account would be opened in 48 hrs. Three weeks later and 2 long on hold calls, I find out my application was rejected (I have accounts at many top banks and CUs). My guess: this bank offered great rates when they need money, and then they hold applications when they get the $ needed and then try to get applicants to accept lower rates.<br/>Whatever their strategy, their bad service and long holds make them a bank to avoid.",2018-04-09
2211,Watch Out For Fine Print,32768,11926,CIT Bank,49619,1,"The folks at CIT are down eight dishonest. If you have been a loyal high yield savings depositor they quietly launch a new product money Market savings and then promote that rate to let you think it applies to you too. IT DOES NOT. The rate you get is about half. When you call to complain and wait in cue they admit to you they understand how you feel and then try to just convert your account to make you feel better. Obviously the senior folks think their customers are STUPID and really don’t deserve your business. My advice, teach them a lesson and close your account, spread the word that this bank is BAD News!!",2018-04-04
2212,CIT Issues,32759,11926,CIT Bank,49585,1,I have recently opened MM account and CDs with CIT to-date I have found their customer service very poor. I have a few questions that I want to discuss with the bank directly however despite multiple attempts I have not been able to speak to an agents via the Contact Center at 855-462-2652. I'm put on call waiting for long periods of time before the call is then dropped. Every time I call the message says they are experiencing unusually high call volume etc..On a couple of occasions the automated service asks for a call back number which I provided but then they don't call you back. This needs to get resolved asap for me to want to continue using them....,2018-04-03
2213,Not Yet Ready To Dip Into The Realm Of Internet Banking.,32747,11926,CIT Bank,49362,1,"There is always a reason, a necessity for offering those enticing rates. I always make a quick call to the bank customer service department simply to get a feel of what I might expect. I was on the music/ ad voice hold for 15 minutes before hanging up. They must be overwhelmed with the response I thought. I clicked the contact information and sent an e-mail, the response to which a message stated that I would be contacted in two business days. The only response I received was a generic ""do not reply"" email that said. ""If you have questions or need assistance, please call our Contact Center at 855-462-2652."" Seriously? For now the extra point five percent is by far not worth the anxiety of dealing with banks like this. There are currently fair to good internet banks offering 1.7% on money markets. Perhaps they will get it right some day",2018-04-01
2214,CIT Bank Review,32588,11926,CIT Bank,49303,5,"I have been using CIT Bank's Savings Account for the past year. The reason I chose the account is because they offered the highest savings account interest rate, currently at 1.55% APY for balances under $100,000. If I have $10,000 saved in the account. I would earn $155 if I just left it there. I have contacted the customer support service about twice for different inquiries on my account, including app setup and balance statements. Each call only lasted a few minutes and I was able to get the information I needed quickly. Most other banks with savings account offers do not come close to the high APY CIT offers, which is why I am sticking with it.",2018-03-31
2215,CIT bank is not the greatest,32580,11926,CIT Bank,49295,3,"Overall I think that the bank employees are the best part of this experience. They are incredibly helpful in making things right. However, I don't think that their fees are fair. I also think that the amount of interest gained from their accounts is not reasonable for the fees they charge. When I signed up I was promised a 200 dollar signing fee of which I still have not received which I think is either false advertising or laziness on someone's part.",2018-03-30
2216,One Of The Worst Online Banks,32540,11926,CIT Bank,49242,1,"I opened an account with this bank one month ago and it took them almost 2 weeks to open the account. They asked a lot of information including Federal Tax Returns. I have no idea why this bank would ask for private information.<br/>After verifying my account information, I was able to link it to an external account and transfer the minimum $100 deposit to try this bank prior to moving a much larger amount.<br/>I was surprised that after wasting all this time to open the account, access to my account was restricted by the bank for an unknown reason and I was asked to contact customer service.<br/>I tried to call customer service but was put on hold for more than 15 minutes and had to hang up.<br/>I sent email to customer service asking them why they restricted access to my account. They sent me a one line reply asking me to call customer service.<br/>I was finally able to call customer service and asked why they have restricted access to my account. The representative told me that the bank decided to end the relationship with me without providing any additional information and will be sending me the check by mail.<br/>I do not understand how this bank expects to do business with customers when they do not treat them with courtesy.<br/>I have another account open at Live Oak Bank, which offers a very competitive rate currently 1.7% and treat their customers with respect at the same time.<br/>I am glad that I did not send a large transfer to this bank. I can't wait for my account to be closed and to get my money back from this bank.<br/>I usually do not like to post comments online but wanted to share my experience with this bank so others can benefit from it.",2018-03-25

2218,Pretty great,32444,11926,CIT Bank,49065,4,"CIT bank is pretty great for making a return on your investment in a savings account. When I started banking with them, they had a high introductory rate and didn't charge any fees, so that was a great switch from Chase, with whom I was banking previously. I set up automatic deductions, with which I has no problem coming out of my previous checking account, and they always came out on time and with no issue. I has a nice feature that I liked that shows you your earned interest per day. I haven't seen that at any other banking institution that I've used in the past. It really makes you want to save more money when you see the amount of interest growing daily, so that is a feature that definitely made me like this bank. The customer service is also really good as far as I'm concerned. I lost my password once and was locked out of my account - which is kind of a positive and a negative, because though their response was good, it was a little too difficult to gain access back into my account compared to other accounts that I've has elsewhere. All in all though, I like this bank and their practices, and don't have any major complaints. I plan to continue banking with them and definitely recommend them to others.",2018-03-20
2219,Recommended by Financial Advisor & happy I decided to bank with CIT Bank,32352,11926,CIT Bank,48855,4,"Last year my grandma died and she left me and my cousins all $11,000. I have never received such a large sum of money at once and didn't know what to do with it. I consulted a financial advisor the company I work for uses and he advised a savings account as I have a family and we know we want to buy a house one day. We don't have any credit card debt. He recommended a three banks for me to research. I spent some time looking at the savings possibilities, customer service and online banking capabilities for all the banks and I chose CIT Bank. I am really glad I did, I have not had any problems. I forgot my password at one point and recovering my password was easy for me, but it also gave me insight to the security. I was pleased with the security and how hard it would be for someone else to take over my account. I don't do daily banking with CIT Bank, the money my grandma left me is kept there and a couple times I have had to pull from it for emergencies. <br/> <br/>I am really happy I decided to consult the financial advisor and I am happy I picked this bank to do business with.",2018-03-14

I signed up for a $100 promotion and have not yet received the bonus in my account. <br/>Unfortunately, I have tried to follow up thru their customer service telephone system. During the last two attempts to call, I waited on hold for over 25 minutes, before a live person answered, which would seem to indicate a lack of suitable # of customer service reps. My situation has still not been resolved and it has become quite frustrating. I would not recommend CIT until they provide adequate and competent customer service assistance.",2018-03-14
2221,My Experience With Cit Bank,32287,11926,CIT Bank,48726,3,I opened an online savings account with CIT Bank a couple of years ago online. I wanted to find an online bank that would help me with my finances and was easily accessible if I needed money transferred to another account. I checked on the bank and read reviews before I opened the account. I found many positive things about the bank. I found that their savings accounts yielded a much higher interest rates then most banks do. CIT also had no penalty CD's which was important to me at the time. I decided to open a savings account and see how it went. My experience was excellent. I have had no issues with outages of my account and if I had any issues at all I just gave them a call and it was resolved. I would recommend CIT to everyone for their online banking needs.,2018-03-11
2222,CIT Bank are pretty average,32282,11926,CIT Bank,48721,3,I used to have a saving account with them. They weren't bad. They were pretty well average. I do not think it was a major high interest account because I have seen better ones. I chose to move some money elsewhere. I didn't have a bad experience though. I never had to call customer service so I can not really comment on that. I had a pretty ggreat experience online though. It was easy to use. I would recommend them to someone else.,2018-03-10
2223,We have enjoyed them so far!,32279,11926,CIT Bank,48718,5,"I decided to move my savings account to CIT simply because of their High Yield Saving Accounts that are around 1.5% right now (at my previous institution, a physical building of a nationally know banking company, I was receiving about half that). They also have a low minimum to get started ($100) so I'm also able to move my grade-school children over who don't have a lot of savings.<br/> <br/>Overall we have been very happy! There are no fees or limits of withdraws, and customer service was very helpful at addressing our concerns. We were initially a little concerned having never been part of an online bank, and had some questions. We spent only a minute or two on hold and the lady who we spoke to was very patient addressing our questions and concerns. We also learned they are insured through the same system and amounts as our previous bank, which really helped to ease our minds.<br/> <br/>Overall, at this moment I feel comfortable recommending them to my friends and family. If you're going to just let your money sit and collect interest, you might as well get a decent rate on it!",2018-03-10
2224,Banking with CIT,32185,11926,CIT Bank,48534,4,"I use CIT bank. I needed to open a no penalty CD and they were only one of two institutions with this option and had the higher interest rate. It was a very quick and easy online process to set up a new account and open the CD. I provided my current bank information and the amount to be transferred in the CD. Once I verified two small deposits made by them, I was good to go. Within about a week the funds were transferred with no problem and no hassle of having to go to my bank in person. I use the app and the mobile site and both are very easy to use and user friendly. So far I have had a very good overall experience with this bank.",2018-03-10
2225,Easy Transaction CD's,32173,11926,CIT Bank,48522,4,"CIT Bank was very easy to work with on terms of what it was that I wanted. I was looking for a custodial deposit CD with a OK return for 1-4 years. They were able to match what I was looking for with a minimum deposit of 50,000 which wasn't terrible. The deposit went smoothly as all I needed to do was wire the money via TD Ameritrade into the account, the process was smooth and I had support via phone to help guide me through this process. The entire process of setting up the account, have the money wired in and the deposit clear took a total of a few days. I received notification of my deposit via email and called to confirm about it going into the CD, I choose the High Yield RampUp CD as it seemed the best choice. Overall, the process was smooth and the transaction was easy to initiate from beginning to end. Customer service was helpful and I'd be willing to repeat this transaction or a similar one again in the near future as needed.",2018-03-08

I have gotten things flagged as suspicious activity while making an online purchase from another country and I appreciate that because it shows that the bank is looking out for that type of activity. I feel like my money is safe with this bank. When I went oversees to Europe last summer, all I had to do was call and let them know where I would be visiting and how long so that they wouldn't flag my card and I had no issues during the duration of the trip. I have used banks in the past that have left me stranded with a card that doesn't work, but I have no experienced anything like that at CIT.",2018-03-05

I had previously held another bank for my CD's, however they contained an average interest rate (1%). After talking with my friend, I found out that CIT bank offered several different CD packages with a much higher interest return rate. While CD's are a low-risk option, I wanted to get as high of a return rate as possible, so I decided to make the switch to CIT bank. Thus far, I have had no issues with the bank, had quick access at all times to my account and am happy with the return rate I'm getting on my CD's.",2018-03-05
2228,Not Happy With This Bank,32121,11926,CIT Bank,48412,1,"The CD rates with this bank are low comparing to some other banks. I have yet to see any benefit from the ramp-up CDs which started out low. The penalty for early withdrawal is shockingly high. The website is not very user friendly. Once my CDs matures, I will go with another bank. I had a CD which matured, and it was automatically renewed... 2, 3 months into the new term I asked about the penalty for early withdrawal and the bank told me something around $2000. I can understand not getting the interest for the 2, 3 month (for the new term), but that was not the case...",2018-02-22
2229,CIT Bank review,31755,11926,CIT Bank,47821,5,I have been with this bank for about four years. This bank offers more services than the local banks in my community. I have better access to my information when I need it and they are reasonable when I need a change to my account.,2018-02-14
2230,Fixed it up,31743,11926,CIT Bank,47809,4,"When I first signed up for a CIT bank account, it was for the bonus and the apy on their savings account, which was one of the best ones out there at the time. Then they spent a few months creating new accounts that paid higher rates of interest, and you'd have to bounce your money over to those new accounts if you still wanted the best rate, which was super annoying. Recently, they seem to have finally settled on a single savings account type that they'll always pay their highest rate of interest to, so banking with them has gotten way better. The rate they pay on deposits are still pretty much the best in the market.",2018-02-12
2231,"Cit Bank, What's With That Silly 1/2 Of 1/10 Percent More You're Offering ??",31838,11926,CIT Bank,47762,3,"At your current 1.55% offering, you are situated 1/2 of 1/10 percent of interest between the top tier online banks that are offering 1.5% interest, and some other good banks offering 1.6% . It's really a silly number for you to have chosen, and is lacking any real incentive for folks to want to bother transferring funds out of their already good paying accounts.<br/><br/>Recently I had over a 100K of cash at Purepoint Bank parked there at 1.40% when all the top competing banks had already raised their interest rates above Purepoint to at least 1.50%. The whole time I also had some money at Live Oak Bank at 1.6% , and at GS/Marcus at 1.50% too. I was finally giving up on Purepoint with their low 1.40% . So I opened an online account at Cit Bank with the required $100 minimum, and was getting ready to transfer my Purepoint cash into Cit Bank when Lo & behold at the last minute PurePoint raised their rate from 1.4% to 1.6% !! I'm in love all over again with Purepoint bank! LOL. <br/><br/>Come on Cit Bank, what's with the 1.55% ?? So many banks are now offering 1.60, and the 1/2 of a 1/10 percent difference you are offering over the big name banks like Marcus and Barclays who are offering 1.50% just isn't worth it for folks to be pulling money out of those accounts they already have for your extra $50 a year on a 100K deposit.",2018-02-09
2232,Ok banking alternative but don't forget your password!,31686,11926,CIT Bank,47712,4,At the suggestion of a close friend I opened three accounts at this bank. I was fed up with the constant fees at my local bank and this bank resolved that issue for me. I did not put very much money into the account in the beginning but shortly used it as my primary banking source. Being in the technology field I was impressed with features and felt it was cutting edge. <br/> <br/>Then I forgot my password. I was hospitalized for two weeks and when I came out of the hospital my phone had not saved the password anymore (which is how I unfortunately remembered my passwords). I contacted customer service and it took five days struggling with them to get my account restored and a new password. This is a testament to the security features though.,2018-02-09
2233,My summary on CIT bank,31681,11926,CIT Bank,47707,4,"They are a nice company to work with. My account was easily opened and although it took about 12 hours for my funds to show up in my account the first time I opened it, it over all was a nice experience. Their online site is easy to use as is their IOS app for my Iphone. So based on my experience with them I would say I have enjoyed being a customer of theirs.",2018-02-08
2234,easy and modern,31676,11926,CIT Bank,47702,5,Being able to use an online resource like this bank has been great. I don't feel like I have to leave the house because their resources are dedicated to the online experience exclusively. If I need to get in contact with them it is easier than what I have experienced in the past and I feel like in 2018 online banking is truly all I need and all most people need. I can deposit checks and move money around freely without any issues and I have yet to have a negative experience. Fingers crossed.,2018-02-07
2235,Very competitive interest rates,31450,11926,CIT Bank,47507,4,"I chose to bank with CIT Bank because they had one of the highest interest rates. I am typically the type of person who moves my money around for the most competitive rate. CIT Bank preemptively raised its savings rate by 20 basis points much to my delight. Many times banks offer high teaser rates only to subsequently lower them, but CIT Bank seems committed to having one of the highest rates in the industry.",2018-02-02
2236,CIT bank savings,31435,11926,CIT Bank,47491,3,"I've had a savings account with CIT bank for quite a few years. I started the account when I had $500 dollars in excess and wanted to have an account separate from the bank I usually do business with (a stash it and forget it account). I've left this account alone and gathering interest this entire time. The reason I didn't rate the bank higher, is that every few years, I have to get a notarized statement to prove that I am still alive and didn't abandon my account. Apparently, stash it and forget it accounts aren't productive to the financial institutions, and they can claim your money if you have ""abandoned"" it. I continue to have the account, but will not do any further business with a bank that isn't local. <br/> <br/>Their customer service personnel are satisfactory and do an excellent job of watching/requiring proof of life for my account.

2238,CIT Bank Review,31376,11926,CIT Bank,47390,4,"I signed up for CIT Bank because of their high-yield savings account with a 0$ monthly fee, which was perfect for my daughter's savings fund. It was fairly easy to sign up with them. The customer service was great and she went above and beyond to answer my questions. Overall, the company is great and has competitive savings rates. However, there are no branches in which you can deposit your money or do any banking in person. Also, the bank's app has many glitches and often exits while I am using it. You are unable to transfer money from another bank or account from the app. I am not always by my computer and prefer the convenience of being able to use my phone. I am happy with the current savings account that I have.",2018-01-28

I was told that I would have the funds in my external account within 2 business days. It has been 4 business days and I still do NOT have the funds in my external account. I am having CIT do a ""trace"" at this time to determine where my over $48,000 is for the 2 accounts closed. This is unacceptable and I will never subject myself to their abuse again.

2240,Customer Service Headed Firmly South - But Do Read The Edit,31456,11926,CIT Bank,41370,2,"Edit: 1/26/18 - While I think it's important to have the original review stand as a note to others of what can go wrong, there is a happier post mortem to my experience: When I got to the right person - a bank officer embedded in their customer service center, he went to great lengths to straighten out the problem, and took significant phone time to answer all my questions in detail. Which is a good thing, as switching the main institutions you rely on for managing finances is a grand PITA. I feel reassured enough to continue with CIT as one of my main financial institutions, and hope that both their frontline customer service staff, as well as some of their former wacky marketing ideas such as forcing customers into new accounts to get the best rates are both resolved over time. I have to commend the officer - very helpful, and extended me every courtesy to resolve the problem.<br/>My original review:<br/>I've dealt with CIT bank for years, and regularly moved significant sums between them and another institution by ACH transfer, without a hitch. (Mostly the willingness of the 'other institution' to be of help whenever a speed bump arose.) <br/>However, for the past 2 years I've experienced a marked decline in both competence and routine customer accomodation. At first it was small things - they raised their savings rate, but didn't update your account to the new rate automatically - you had to notice the change, call *them* to find out that in order to get the new rate, you were forced to close your old account and open a new, differently named and numbered account to qualify for the new rate. And other such annoyances.<br/>But recently, they provided one of the worst customer experiences of my life: Since all the accounts were changed to new accounts, all the ACH and wire instructions were made obsolete - I found this out by placing an ACH transaction to deposit money *to* them, only to have it bounce back. CIT claimed they had no idea nor info why the ACH didn't go through. Investigation with the 'other institution' showed that my link was no longer valid - it was attached to the now-closed account. I had to wait almost a week to find this out, as CIT at first said it could take 3-5 business days for ACH funds to clear their clearinghouse. It was after that time expired that I began to investigate.<br/>And then it got much worse: The 'other institution' is much more competent and timely, and it's always been a better bet to 'push' or 'pull' funds from their end. They have a time-proven document to establish new ACH links. However, one step involved uploading a voided check. That's not possible, given that the CIT account was a savings account. The document provided two alternative ways of creating and verifying the link in that case: Either a pre-printed deposit slip with the requisite information (ABA routing number, account number, etc. - nothing fancy.) Or a letter from a CIT bank officer, with the same routine information.<br/>I spent several hours over the course of several days, only to end up with CIT saying they 'couldn't do' either of those, and suggesting that the only way to create and verify an ACH link was for the 'other institution' to send CIT a letter requesting that exact (mundane) information. I said given that the 'other institution' was huge in comparison to CIT's capitalization, I doubt they'd change their lawyer-approved form to suit CIT. And after delaying me, in my most recent conversation with CIT, mostly on hold for an hour, before I was allowed to speak with a supervisor, I finally got them to agree to put one on the line. I pointed out the obvious - 1. When they called I was in the midst of leaving a message for a bank officer in their New York operation, wanting to ask them if they really wanted to lose this much business by being customer-toxic. and 2. Did the supervisor really want to be responsible for losing an account of this size, over a problem that CIT itself had created when it forced customers to all get new accts? She promised to call me back in an hour, at closing time. 1 1/2 hours later, she called, said that they could send the letter from a bank officer. She had the requirements either wrong or vague, so I repeated them verbatim - ABA routing number, account number, etc. She said they'd send that to my email shortly. Many hours later, my mailbox has no missive from CIT.<br/>In conclusion, I'd think twice if I were you about vesting funds with CIT. Unlike past times, their 'clearance' of ACH transactions has ballooned to as much as 5 days - and if things go wrong, they're not going to know anything about tracking that down. Same with rejected wires. People have complained about days of losing interest with Able Banking, the current savings/MM leader. If you're going to get abused, why not get the 15 extra basis points? And you've got to ask yourself this: What kind of service can you expect from a bank that only at the point of threatening to pull all funds out of a substantial account do they start to meet the most mundane standards of customer service, rather than customer torture? It's a real shame - I used to be a big fan of them. if things get better, I'll try to revise this.",2018-01-24
2241,Manage money he right way !,31109,11926,CIT Bank,46764,4,"At first glance , I wasn't the banking type. I wouldn't go to a bank or credit union. Years down the line I decided that I wanted to open up a banking account to start saving money. I wanted to become more organized and the main important option was to open up an account for my child, So that when he gets old enough to invest in his future, he surely can. My experience with CIT Bank is overall an awesome experience, which has put all of my fears to rest. I like the customer service . They make sure all of your needs are well taken care of. There fees are decent and the program and incentives that they offer seem to be some of the best I've seen.",2018-01-20
2242,CIT Bank Experience.,31086,11926,CIT Bank,46741,4,"What can I say about CIT Bank? I have had experiences with several banking institutions, and like many others, CIT Bank has it's ups and downs. <br/>Many people, when opening a new bank account, don't automatically have $500 dollars or more to immediately put in to their savings account; especially newer, younger customers. So, they would unfortunately have to pay a monthly fee until they have at least $500 in their savings accounts and you know that nobody likes monthly fees for banking. Is it enough that they have FEE-FREE ATM machines to counterbalance the monthly fees for many other things with CIT Bank. For many, the answer would be no. However, if you're established and want to check out additional options for banking, CIT Bank definitely has pros for you. Take a look on their website or contact their customer service for any questions. Their customer service is very good.",2018-01-16
2243,Great bank,31080,11926,CIT Bank,46734,4,I really like CIT bank they have helped me a lot. Generally when I call a bank I'm a little stressed when having to deal with customer service but every time I have contacted them about my personal banking they have been able to help me out. On one such occasion without naming names of exact details I was in a bit of trouble they where able to figure out a short term solution for a savings account which help me out of the whole I was in. I suppose all in all the thing that keeps me going back to them is loyalty and there savings account plans also the fact I feel like they care.

2244,"CIT Banking - good service, large fees",31067,11926,CIT Bank,46721,4,My personal experience with CIT is a pretty typical one when banking. I received excellent customer service from this bank whenever I would have a small issue with my account. The only problem I had banking with this company is the the overdraft fees were way too expensive. Also the minimum you must have in account is too much. I feel that if banks want to gain new customers they must make their services more accessible to people with lower income and cannot afford to keep an account open with high maintenance fees. Other than that I enjoy banking with CIT. Mainly because of their excellent friendly customer service. Every employee I would talk to while banking with them would handle my issue quickly and effectively.,2018-01-14

First of all, this is a ridiculous timeframe for an internal transfer. Its 2018, what century is this bank living in? Ive called them numerous times telling them I have an emergency and need the funds. They don’t care. Their agents and even the supervisors dont have the power to do anything except make empty promises. They have to send an email to their back office who they cant talk to. This is absolutely ridiculous I dont even know how this bank functions. Do not open a no-penalty CD with them because they will find a way to penalize you. Like myself.

2247,Great To Work With,31254,11926,CIT Bank,47184,5,Everything that I have had to do has been easy. The only thing that I do not like is how long it takes to clear funds; usually about a week. BofA clears funds in a day; not that I like BofA. There recent no penalty CD was something that no one else offers. I split my savings into 2 CD's so that I could access money if needed but they raised the savings to the same the CD so moving from the CD to savings did not cost me any thing.,2018-01-12
2248,Challenge To Get IRA Money Out,31251,11926,CIT Bank,47178,1,"I decided to close out a CD early and move the money. I had the new place send them the completed form for a transfer. CIT called me, went through the process of confirming it was me, then said they didn't like my signature on the transfer form, didn't match what they had on file (it was EXACTLY the same), was this really my signature? I said yes it was. <br/>They then said, well, we don't care, we refuse to believe that is your signature(!). Now why they would contact me and ask, if they don't care what my reply is, I cannot imagine. So, I asked what is it going to take to get my money. They said I would have to complete an APA (All Purpose Acknowledgement) with a Notary. Of course, notaries in every state are different, there is no such form in Texas. They offered to send me a blank form via snail mail, not email. <br/>So, sent it all in a circle again, still waiting. I suppose I'll wait another week or two, then call a buddy of mine who knows the AG. If they are doing this to me, just to not give me my money, they are no doubt doing it to others. One should never offer a lawyer an easy class action suit.<br/>Needless to say, I'll be removing the remaining accounts I have there.",2018-01-11
2249,Review of CIT Bank,31034,11926,CIT Bank,46684,4,"I opened a savings account with CIT Bank three years ago. It was a very easy and quick process. The bank representative I worked with was very pleasant and was happy to answer all of my questions. I have been pleased with the ease of online banking through this bank. There have been several times where my check deposits have not posted for a week. When I've called customer service they have been quick and looked into my question, provided an explanation and told me when to expect to see the deposit post to the account. I have recommended this bank to my friends, and several have opened accounts there as a result. <br/> <br/>While I was living in California, there was a CIT Bank branch right around the corner from where I lived. This made banking very convenient. I have since moved, and though there are no direct banks near me, their online banking tools have allowed this to not be a problem and allowed me to continue on with my banking, without a hitch.",2018-01-11

At first I wanted to use my regular local bank, but I had some issues with them issuing me fees and such things for a while so I thought it would be nice to try out a new banking service. I have been so pleases that I had decided to try CIT. They have turned out to be wonderful and far superior to my previous bank! Their rates are very reasonable and they are listed clearly in the terms, and you can find answers to any information about banking fees listed clearly on the website if you have questions about a fee. The web/mobile app is always up to date and working properly, I've experienced no glitches or problems loading the sites on my PC or my mobile device.

It's easier to look at all my accounts using the format they have.

I appreciated this about them and I am glad that they were so quick in doing this for our family.

2253,Sleek but sometimes confusing,30901,11926,CIT Bank,46441,4,I think that whenever I go into this branch I feel a sense of comfort. The walls are imbued with glass and have this modern feeling to it which makes for an inviting and enticing bank from the outside but on the inside you can get confused as to where to go in some cases. The bankers seemed like they had lots of experiences and always helped me through my issues but were impersonal at times.

I transferred funds from a large banking institution (e.g. Chase, BOA, etc.) to CIT using a promotional code and received a $100 bonus. The reason why I transferring bank accounts is because I was receiving a terribly low interest rate. I was earning less than a dollar month for leaving my large balance of cash in the prior account. However, now I am earning more interest and it has compounded greatly. Furthermore, CIT Bank only requires a small minimum deposit of $100 to open so it doesn't have a large requirement. In addition, there aren't any fees related to maintenance and account opening. The mobile application has a great user interface that allows you to check your balances quickly.",2017-12-22

So I figured they were a reputable bank, and opened ""ramp-up"" CDs. We all know that these type of CDs offer a lower rate than a regular CD because if rates rise you can ramp up to a higher rate without penalty. I figured rates were on the way up so I chose to take the initially lower rate in the expectation that I would ramp up later.Well, over the last year rates have gone up, but they do not raise the rate of these CDs! It seems once they have your money locked up, they want to keep it at a lower rate. Their liquid accounts now have a significantly higher rate than I have in a CD! This is all very frustrating since it contradicts the entire point of a ramp up. I feel I was suckered! As soon as these CDs mature, I will move those funds to a more ethical bank!",2017-12-18

Due to these fees it made it really difficult to get my savings account back into the positive again, but I was able to pull it off. I wasn't really happy with the in personal service.

I was excited when she told me there was the ability to link up to outside banks. She also mentioned 24/7 customer service but also insured me that I could call or text her anytime I had questions. There are no fees and it was easy to sign up. Overall is was a good first bank at that point in my life. I remember one instance, when I was dating someone and being young and naive, I agreed to allow this person onto my account. I was working and they weren't so all of the money in the account was mine. Next thing I know, one day we break up and my money is gone.

CIT is great for that. I opened this about 6 months ago and have set up regularly weekly withdrawals that come right out of my checking account. The money is easily moved and does not cause any problems. There are no fees that come with the account that will eat into my interest gain on the money. It creates a situation where you are not getting an interest rate every month that is about 1.35% and not being charged a fee. This allows you to get a certain amount of interest per day and it has a really nice feature that allows you to keep track of the interest per day. That makes it fun to follow along on how much you are getting for having your money in there. It also gives you motivation to increase the amount so you can get more per day. Their customer service is also very good, the only time I had to use it was to get a new password since mine as locked out. It was very easy and did not cause any problems at all.

Fact is the high yield account I signed up for was now paying 1.14% (no notice of the decrease). I don't like banks that play games -- and this one does. Next day I pulled all my funds and rolled them back to my AMEX on line account. AMEX doesn't play games. If you want a full time job monitoring ""nuanced"" games and opening and closing accounts (with a 45 minute wait if - forbid - you ever want to talk to someone on their customer service line) CIT would be for you.

I love how easy it is to access my statements online, and on mobile. They have innovative ways of collecting interest while making the effort to add money to one's savings.",2017-11-04
2271,Great Online Bank,30136,11926,CIT Bank,44543,4,"There's nothing exceptional in terms of interest rates or unique customer services, but my experiences with CIT Bank have been overall positive. I have had no difficulties in making deposits and withdrawals, any problems I have had (of which there are few) were resolved quickly and effectively by the courteous customer service. I don't necessarily interact with them much, but my experiences using their web interface have been positive: much better than a couple of their competitors. Overall, I'm happy with the service that I get, and will probably continue to use CIT Bank for the foreseeable future.",2017-11-03
2272,A pretty good bank that has quality customer service,30129,11926,CIT Bank,44536,4,"I was looking for an online bank because I discovered they had better rates than the usual banks. CIT Bank was the winner for me. At the time, they had a very competitive rate and I was able to easily open an account through the website. While they don't offer a lot of products, I was just looking for a savings account so that didn't really matter to me. I primarily use the account for my emergency fund. I like their website and app. Both are easily functional and makes banking easy.",2017-11-02

2274,You get what you pay for.,29752,11926,CIT Bank,43517,3,I opened an account here awhile back. The low cost to open an account and lack of fees is what drew me in. For the most part it is a great place to do business with you get what is advertised and stated. It was also easy to check on my account and keep up to date with it. The down side is customer service. while not bad as in rude people and such it had long wait times that at times were unacceptable.,2017-10-11
2275,I recently opened a CIT bank savings account,29723,11926,CIT Bank,43468,4,I opened a CIT bank savings account about 6 months ago. Motivated by a $100 sign up bonus and a 1.05% interest rate. So far my experience has been a positive one. The transactions have all been smooth. I am able to access all my information online and get relatively detailed info on my account. My bonus is deposited in my account and I have been receiving the 1.05% interest on a monthly basis. So far so good in my opinion.,2017-10-08
2276,Why i lovethis bank,29707,11926,CIT Bank,43450,4,"CIT Bank is a great online bank. I started an account with them several years ago. The savings account has a great interest rate. I like their online banking platform. It's easy to use and I've never really had a problem with it. Making deposits is simple and straightforward. The one time I chatted with customer service, I didn't have to wait very long and they were able to check my account and make sure the issue I had was resolved quickly. Overall, I would recommend them to my friends.",2017-10-07
2277,CIT Bank Review - Very Average,29669,11926,CIT Bank,43411,3,"CIT Bank was not a bad selection for a small account that I opened up. They were fairly convenient as far as setting up the account and getting started. However, I was not looking to utilize them for my primary banking, as I have been established as a long term customer with another bank. I did want to utilize them to help teach my children about saving money where they could learn the benefits and gain an understanding of what saving can do for them. Their usage was fairly average and made teaching them quite simple. It was also a nice setup to have the online banking aspect, as that is what kids these days are so familiar with. However, overall I am pleased that they served the purpose, I would not use them for my major banking needs because the company I am with gives great rates and more importantly treats me as a part of their family when I have special needs or requirements, I felt CIT Bank was just average.",2017-10-02
2278,Competitive savings account,29536,11926,CIT Bank,43145,3,"I was having about 50K spare money in Chase that generated about six dollars interest every month. Then I decided to move my fund to a different bank with higher savings rate. The CIT bank was having a promotion of $100 sign on bonus with 1.3% interest rate at that time. I did some research and it seemed fair to give it a try, mostly because CIT bank is FDIC insured. The entire process took place online without a hassle, and so far I'm quite satisfied with my transition. The website is easy to use, and I like that I can view my account easily through online banking at any time. One thing I'm not sure is that the bank claimed to update my interest daily when I opened the account, but the interest doesn't actually show up in my account by the end of the month.",2017-09-22
2279,"Easy To Open, Raised Rate Afterwards",29730,11926,CIT Bank,43476,4,Opened a savings account two months ago for 1.30% APR and $100 bonus. Opening account took a few days but was otherwise easy. Today my rate got raised to 1.35%. Expect bonus to post in about 2 months from now.,2017-09-21
2280,Premier High Yield Savings Account,29339,11926,CIT Bank,42544,4,"I opened a Premier High Yield Savings account about a year ago with CIT Bank and have been pleased. The few times I've contacted customer service I had a satisfactory experience, my questions were answered quickly and I haven't had any issues there. I really like their no-fee structure, I was able to open an account without any fees and as long as I keep $100 in the account there's no problem. The Annual Percent Yield on the account is 1.3% which is higher than I was able to get at a local bank, so I decided to make the switch to an online bank, which is also free (all online banking is free)! I don't see myself switching to another bank in the near future as I'm satisfied and don't have any reasons for changing at the moment.",2017-09-18
2281,My Experience Banking with CIT Bank,29331,11926,CIT Bank,42536,4,"I have been banking with CIT Bank since May of this year. I was attracted to CIT Bank because of the high interest rate advertised for personal savings accounts. However, what really ""sealed the deal"" was a $250 bonus paid to those who opened an account who kept a minimum of $100,000 through 6/30/17. Note that I complied with this balance requirement but have not received the bonus yet. Assuming the bonus is paid, I would say my experience with CIT Bank has been positive. Deposits and withdrawals have been promptly executed and interest rates offered have been one of the highest I have found for an Internet-only bank. Their security system is satisfactory as I have used my iPad for occassional banking and they have required a code sent to my cell phone to be inputted during the log-in process. All in all, I would say my experience has been very good with CIT Bank.",2017-09-17
2282,My new Cit Bank Account,29327,11926,CIT Bank,42532,3,"I am actually a brand new customer with Cit Bank. I was researching online banks and this company seemed like a good find. I opened a savings account that I plan on making small deposits to weekly, like bonus's from work and other general deposits. They have a great return rate of 1.30% apy, but that isn't until you have quite a bit of money saved. The only issue I have so far is that the sign up process was long an slightly confusing. I have opened several accounts with local credit unions and it was a breeze. This website is clunky and takes a while to load which adds to the headache of getting the account opened in the first place. Luckily their customer service is great, they don't have a chat feature but I sent them an email and I had a response within the hour to address my issues with opening the account. All in all I am optimistic about the account and I will have a better assessment as the year progresses.",2017-09-16
2283,Premier High Yield Savings Account,29322,11926,CIT Bank,42527,4,"I opened a Premier High Yield Savings account about four months ago with CIT Bank and have had a good experience with them. I really like their no-fee structure, I opened my account without any fees and as long as there's $100 in the account there's no other fees.The few times I've contacted customer service I had a normal and expected experience, my few questions were answered quickly and I haven't had any problems. The APY on the account is 1.3% which is better than I was able to get at my local bank, so I decided to switch over to an online bank. I don't see myself moving my account to another bank in the near future as I'm happy and don't have any reasons for switching at the moment.",2017-09-16
2284,Not that great,29314,11926,CIT Bank,42519,3,"I've been banking with CIT Bank for a couple of years now, and they fell short of my initial expectations. A friend referred me to them and they had great things to say about this bank, so I thought I would try it out. For the most part, the bank is ok, but the customer service is terrible. Anytime I have an issue with my account (which recently has been pretty frequent), I am on hold for an unreasonable amount of time, then when someone answers and I explain what is wrong, they put me on hold again only for someone else to pick up and I have to explain my situation all over again. Aside from the frustrating customer service, the banking aspect is average, nothing special that I would rave about. All in all, if you're looking for a decent bank and don't mind having crappy customer service, then this bank is ok. However, if you like to feel like you're valued as a customer, go somewhere else.",2017-09-14
2285,Nice experience,29310,11926,CIT Bank,42515,5,"If you are looking for a CD that actually pays out a decent rate on any given day, this bank absolutely has what you're looking for. I still have a CD from them that paid out 2% APY. The setup was incredibly easy and the people are so friendly. Their online banking platform is a little outdated, but if you just want to check your balances and know what is going on with your money, it will work just fine. Not many banks out there are offering competitive rates on any deposit products, but this bank is still out there doing just that.",2017-09-14
2286,CIT Bank was not for me,29297,11926,CIT Bank,42500,3,I joined CIT bank about 3 years ago and only kept my account with them for about 3 months. The problems started during the process of recieving my debit card. It took about 3 weeks for my debit card to finally reach me without any mistakes or delays. After that I found out that their online website was very poorly coded and did not run smooth at all. I did not like to get online to do anything. because the site was so bad. That meant I was always trying to get info in other ways. I also did not like the customer service that left you on hold for 40 minutes every time that you had to call for an issue. In all it was a terrible 3 months of banking for me and I would not recommend to anyone.,2017-09-12
2287,CIT CD's,29253,11926,CIT Bank,42426,4,"I opened a 12 month CD with CIT in 2015. They offered a much higher interest rate than anyone else I looked into. I made sure to do research on the company before I put any money in, but online reviews assured me that it was a legitimate bank. The process of depositing money was simple and quick. The only problem I had with the bank was the fact that the CD automatically rolled over after a very short grace period that I missed. Naturally, this was largely my fault, but the penalty for early withdrawal was fairly small so not a big deal. Overall I was very impressed working with CIT and would recommend them considering their higher than average interest rates.",2017-09-08
2288,Experince with CIT bank,29251,11926,CIT Bank,42424,4,"I had a good experience with this bank while opening an account for a Certificate of the Deposit. Initially when I called to get the information, the customer representative was so kind to answer all my questions I had for opening this account including benefits, minimum balance and all the info which a new customer seek for information. When I asked for their personal opinion for which account I should open, they have explained me with all the information. I am so happy after the service I have received from them 2 years back and I still have an account with them and I am enjoying the great benefits which I was expecting. I will definitely recommend the service I have received from the customer and the benefits I am getting today from the institution.",2017-09-07

2290,Never Again,29420,11926,CIT Bank,42766,1,"Posting as: toeser<br/><br/>Title Never again<br/>I just transferred all of my money out of my savings account and I will never return to this bank. CIT posts a very high savings rate, and in small print, for accounts up to $100,000. I assumed that I would get the posted rate on the first $100,000, and something lower on the amount over. I was receiving a low rate on my entire savings account. <br/><br/>Next, I had a two-year CD mature. I never received any notice of that. They automatically rolled it for two years, at what I do not consider a competitive rate. When I called to close the CD, they told me I had exceeded the 10-days needed to take action (it was about 12 days), so if I wished to close out the CD I would have to pay a $600 penalty. That money will be pulled from this bank on the day of maturity. There are too many banks that want my money to continue dealing with an organization this unprofessional.",2017-09-01
2291,CIT Bank Review,29162,11926,CIT Bank,42274,4,"CIT bank was an excellent alternative to the run of the mill brick and mortar banks like WF, BA and BBVA. Their lack of physical infrastructure allows them to add to things that really matter, and that's more money in your pocket. Their customer service was about average with exception of their wait time. Their wait time for phone calls was extremely low. I mean really low. I was connected with an agent within 1 minute of calling every single time.<br/> <br/>At the time of my account being active, their interest rates were better than other brick and mortar stores. But it's not like an extra 0.05% adds up too much over time. Their sign up process was easy and did not require a lot of extraneous information. I plan to continue using their services and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for an online bank.",2017-08-30
2292,CIT Bank experience is positive,29125,11926,CIT Bank,42235,3,"CIT Bank has a very well put together website. They offer great interest rates on CDs, which is how I found them. Their Premier High Yield savings account has a great rate and pays more than my previous Financial Institution. I opened 3 of these accounts for myself and my children. It's easy to access via the Internet. Their customer service is pretty good but I haven't really had any problems. Overall, it has been a positive experience.",2017-08-27
2293,Easy to use,28915,11926,CIT Bank,41638,4,This is the main bank I use for my in person banking. Because most of the time it is always still good to keep a physical deposit account. So I remember when I set it up the process was extremely simple. Unlike other banks which take up all your time nope not CIT they are about giving you quick setups and resolutions. Which is nice compared to most things where it eats up your time i was able to get in their and get my account ready to go in less than ten minutes which is good for my busy life. They were also friendly and quick to answer every question I had problems with which was nice. overall it was a good experience and I will use them as long as the service stays as good as it had when I started service with little to no problems.,2017-08-18
2294,Great Rates But A Hassle,29080,11926,CIT Bank,42183,1,"What a hassle to set-up and fund accounts. Took multiple hours on the phone to set-up and fund 2 accounts...not sure it was worth it. CIT wasn't able to create a document for me that we need for our mortgage application - just needed a document that included the bank name, account number, my name and balance. I'm in the process of closing our accounts and transferring all money back to a real bank, but can't yet as the money takes about 10 days to be ""available."" While most customer service personnel have been pleasant, we ran into Rob, an extremely sarcastic manager - an unbelievably frustrating 10 day experience with CIT, never again.",2017-08-17
2295,A Fluid Banking Experience,28868,11926,CIT Bank,41559,4,I was a college student up to my neck in student loans and needed a clear way to repay my debts. As a result I researched banks and found that CIT bank fit my needs. They offered a satisfactory consultation that relieved my concerns and offered clarification to any questions I had before going in. In the end I was able to sign for an account at the bank and get my affairs in order. I am completely satisfied with my experiences with CIT and would recommend it heartily to others looking for a way to manage their finances. I signed up for a 1.25% APY no penalty CD and could live stress free knowing I could withdraw at any time as long as it was within seven days of receiving funds.,2017-08-15
2296,Easy to work with.,28862,11926,CIT Bank,41553,4,"This bank did an awesome job setting up online access to account services. I can go online check my account, transfer money, pay bills and make deposits. They also offer app services that make mobile banking easier than jumping online to fill out forms. The convenience in which the system is set up is also easily understood and used. This is a great way to bank when you cannot get to the brick & mortar shop to do your banking. The bank employees are extremely helpful and always willing to help teach a customer about their new implementations to help make life easier. I once even had an employee go above and beyond to help me get my account paperwork settled because my postman was not delivering mail properly. It happened after I had opened my account online and had just recently moved. So my postman decided to not deliver mail to me. The employee was so generously helpful. She canceled the card sent in the mail and sent me a new one. I was so thankful to have such resourceful people who went out of their way for the customers like that.",2017-08-14
2297,Got Scammed Out Of Interest Bonus,29017,11926,CIT Bank,41958,1,"In March 2017 Cit Bank promotion indicated that adding ""new money"" amounting to $15,000 and maintaining a balance of this new money for at least 90 days would provide a $100 Bonus. The details were as follows:<br/><br/>CIT Bank's limited-time promo offers savers 1.05 percent and a bonus of up to $400 for opening and funding one of its high-yield savings accounts by June 30. But it comes with some requirements.<br/>To qualify, you must make a minimum initial deposit of $100. And it must be new money — not cash already on deposit at CIT Bank or its OneWest Bank division.<br/>The California-based bank will pay a bonus of $100 if you have an average monthly balance of $15,000 to $99,999, a $250 bonus for an average balance of $100,000 to $299,999 and a $400 bonus for balances of $300,000 or more.<br/>If you maintain the balance for three monthly statement cycles, the cash bonus will be deposited into your account within 45 days of the end of the third full monthly statement cycle.<br/><br/>On March 6, 2017 I added $15,000 to my savings account and maintained more than $15,000 through August 1, 2017 and when no $100 bonus was applied to my account I contacted Cit Bank and they refused my bonus stating that I should have opened a new savings account in March to qualify for the bonus. This was not the case during the promotion that predicated my deposit. I have noticed that their current newer promotions do require opening a new account but this was definitely not the case during the promotion that I complied with. They changed their criteria for their subsequent promotions and refused to honor my earned bonus. If you have an account with this bank be very careful about getting ripped-off with their promotions. Shame on Cit Bank management doing business like this.",2017-08-08
2298,Terrible Customer Service And Bank,28935,11926,CIT Bank,41692,1,"Wasted 3 weeks of my time trying to create an account and talking to customer service.<br/>First, they lost my account and I had to create it again. Then, after repeated calls notifying them that I never got the small deposits made to my transferring bank account, the customer service kept telling me over and over it will be done again. After 3 weeks, it still has not been done. <br/>They verified all my information each time I call.<br/>Total waste of time. Now I'm scared since they have all my information.",2017-07-31
2299,CIT bank: superior rates and bonuses,28306,11926,CIT Bank,40152,4,"CIT bank lured me in with a bonus for a deposit in their savings account. I was looking to move some money into a relatively risk free place for a little while as I waited for some of the market stuff to shake out, and I saw that they were offering a relatively large ($100) bonus and a pretty awesome rate (1.045%) on their savings accounts. I was able to sign up entirely online. The online experience was interesting. The graphics and UI on the website is decidedly clunky. They could definitely use a UX engineer to make things pretty. I needed to figure out my bank account and routing number, and I emailed them, and they got back to me relatively quickly, which was good. The only remaining hurdle they have to jump is maintaining a reasonable withdrawal policy. I'm not sure when I'm going to pull money out, but as long as they let me have it without charging me a crazy fee or limiting the amount of money that I can pull out at any given time, and they keep that interest rate on their savings account pretty high, I fully intend to continue banking there in the future.",2017-07-17
2300,Still Need Improvement,28652,11926,CIT Bank,31150,3,"The wait time at their call center is much better and agents are better informed, yet some are still providing erroneous instructions, resulting in delays in receiving funds. For example, I was told that in order to process a wire-transfer money to an external bank, I needed to transfer money from a CD that had matured to a regular savings account. Subsequently, CIT's wire department contacted me and stated that there would be a delay in moving the funds from the CD to the savings account and that I could have wired the money directly from the CD account to an external bank.",2017-07-15
2301,CIT 2 year certificate of deposit info,28272,11926,CIT Bank,40063,4,"I bought a two year certificate of deposit from CIT bank about six months ago. Overall, I would give the experience with CIT a high mark because the process was easy and somewhat fast. I was not thrilled with the 1.40% rate over two years, but that is the environment we are in and most banks are the same. Sadly, this does not keep up with inflation, so you have to wonder what is going on these days? Anyway, the customer service was very good and they were attentive to my needs, which were few. It was a very simple process, just make sure to bring your identification. I first learned about CIT bank through their internet website and then found my local office. I had all the relevant information I needed when I arrived so buying the CD was quick and without any confusion. I chose the two year CD because it fit with my financial plan. I think CIT is very competitive and like I said the low interest rates are everywhere, so there isn't much competition to study.",2017-07-14
2302,CIT Bank Review,28257,11926,CIT Bank,40047,4,All of my banking experiences with CIT Bank have overall been quite positive ranging the gamut of facets of their business from the various products they offer to the customer service experiences of customers. I personally think that all of their banking products are incredibly comparable to the other big banks in the nation along with the fees they charge for different things such as overdraft charges or electronic wire fees. The mobile experience on bankoncit.com is also quite top notch and easily compares with their competitors in that department as well although it does take some time to familiarize yourself with the user interface. I will undoubtedly continue to bank with CIT Bank as they have been one of the best banks I have ever worked with considering everything they do well and the superb customer service they provide.,2017-07-11
2303,Positive Experience with CIT Bank,28089,11926,CIT Bank,39595,4,I have been banking with CIT now for just over four years. I love my banking experience. The bank employees seem to love their job and that shows as the customer service experience is beyond my expectations. Recently I went in to deposit a check and had a few minutes to spare and asked about opening an IRA as I'm an independent contractor and wanted to start saving responsibly for retirement. The teller i worked with was very knowledgeable and answered all my question with confidence and got the process started before handing me off to one of her associates. It was a very quick and easy process. I have worked with many financial institutions in my day and banking with CIT has been by far the best banking experience with very competitive rates. The online support is great and allows me to communicate instantly if I need to. I would highly recommend their financial services to anyone looking to open an account.,2017-06-27
2304,Great Experience with CIT,28072,11926,CIT Bank,39579,4,"I have been using CIT for quite some time and have almost no issues when banking with them. I have called customer service on several occasions to ask basic questions about my accounts, and each time I was assisted thoroughly and felt as if I was a valued customer. I have a savings account and a high-yield CD with CIT, which I plan to renew once the term is up. They are also offering a significant savings APY that my husband is taking advantage of this year. I would recommend this banking institution to my family and friends, and I feel that my money is safe and can be trusted with CIT. They are returning their own yields to the customer in the form of very attractive investment and savings options. I cannot comment on comparable banks as I have not been in the market for a new institution.",2017-06-21
2305,Experience with a CIT Bank Savings Account,27967,11926,CIT Bank,39337,4,"I have only recently opened a Savings Account with CIT Bank about 2 months ago, however my experience thus far has been exceptional. I was skeptical at first, as I was used to the traditional brick and mortar banking experience, but was convinced to give CIT a chance based on how strong their interest rates are for Savings Accounts and have not been disappointed. In addition to an APY over 1.00%, no fees of any kind, the $100 bonus that I am also expecting to receive really puts them over the top. As far as customer service and their web experience goes, I have nothing but good things to say, as they have been responsive to my needs since day one, and their web interface is intuitive enough for anyone to navigate.",2017-06-21
2306,Savings Account,28386,11926,CIT Bank,40260,2,"I opened a High Yield Savings account on April 30th, I noticed they had a new savings account in May called spring savings that had a different rate.

2307,CIT Bank is a great experience,27927,11926,CIT Bank,39287,4,"I think this bank institution has been a great experience for me. I really like the customer support they are really helpful with any problems I've had. I think CIT offers many great rewards like automatic savings, tax saving strategies, and more. I am happy to be a part of this banking institution. Also I like the fact that they have high yield savings meaning, you are able to save a nice amount of savings and great interest rates. I would probably be with this banking institution for may years to come. <br/>You also get payroll deductions which I think its great. They offer so many great rewards I think anyone interested in joining this company banking institution would be very impressed with their services. I would recommended this banking company to anyone who wants to be satisfied with a good bank.",2017-06-14
2308,Impossible To Close Account,28280,11926,CIT Bank,26302,1,"A good bank but they play games with interest teaser rates then drop 'em low. If you don't keep a frequent eye on your account you will start to loose money on interest earnings. Tired of this game CIT was playing, I moved all funds out, and requested to close my account back in late Feb 2017. 3 emails back and forth telling me that the account is closed, but that I could still log on in case I needed to get copies of statements; Say What? Now well over 90 days since the account was closed it is still active, I can send and retrieve funds without any issues. Once you join CIT, you can check out anytime, but you can never leave. I guess at Zero it will sit indefinitely.",2017-06-10
2309,Free to open savings and bank online at CIT!,27894,11926,CIT Bank,39254,4,"I am writing this because I don't think many people are aware that at CIT Bank you can open a savings account for free. There are no fees, so you really can make the most of your money. You do however have to have a minimum amount to open , I think it is only about a hundred dollars though. I really think CIT Bank has one of the best savings account options around, they really have helped me to maximize my savings with their compounding interest and free banking online. Their site is pretty easy to navigate and is free to bank on as well.

2311,This Is Kind Of Crazy,28028,11926,CIT Bank,2280,1,"Today I received an email from CIT that said they would not open an account for me due to information obtained from Chex Systems, a credit reporting company that I have (fortunately) never heard of. The information that CIT summarized from Chex Systems is inaccurate and I have sent a request for more information to Chex. This is totally weird as I have accounts at over 20 banks (lucky me!) and my credit score is 825 out of 850 at Credit Wise, through Capital One. So watch out if you try to open an account at CIT. It looks like they rely upon bogus information from Chex Systems, and I think they pull a hard credit check, which makes it worse.",2017-05-18
2312,Why I use CIT bank.,27748,11926,CIT Bank,38992,4,"I have used CIT bank for over a year now. I have to say, I really am happy with them.

2313,CIT Bank a Personal Perspective,27646,11926,CIT Bank,38827,4,"CIT Bank is like any other bank in other than that it focuses on online banking and savings and loan options. They offer a wide variety of investment options that you can manipulate online very conveniently. They offer a little better rate than most banks do for their savings accounts. There are also Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and IRAs available. For me since I was traveling a lot to different states, it made sense to have this kind of banking. Their fees are in line with other banks and maybe even a bit lower. If you looking for checking and a personal ""down the street"" banking experience, it would probably be better to go local. If you want the convenience of online banking for your savings, investments and personal loans, CIT Bank is a great option, particularly for those on the go.",2017-05-03
2314,Cit Bank -- The Very Worst One I've Ever Used,27801,11926,CIT Bank,39095,1,"Horrible experience with their service. Terrible, disorganized website. Tried to open an online savings account for $100,000, instead they opened two (2) savings accounts for $100,000 each -- without my knowledge, of course. More than that, they attempted to ACH $200,000 from my funding external bank account, instead of $100,000. The customer service is totally incompetent, they are not able to comprehend basic things. The customer service manager is unprofessional. All in all, there were not able correct the situation (I simply asked them to delete the second account I never requested to open in the first place, but they could not do that) and they seemingly got prepared to rip off my external bank account by withdrawing $200,000. I had to urgently drive to my non-CiT bank involved in this to put stop payment on any attempt by CiT bank to withdraw funds. Stay clear of these guys!",2017-05-02

I was planning to put all my profit after expenses into it. I did like that there was no fees for the account which is why i was drawn to it in the first place. Customer service was very friendly even after I told them I was closing the account after I decded to transfer everything into a bank that we had decided to open a checking account with that was local in our town.,2017-04-26

2319,A decent bank for having a savings account but that's about it.,27381,11926,CIT Bank,38328,3,"I have a number of savings accounts across multiple banks. I chose CIT Bank because they had a low opening deposit requirement of $100. This is the lowest I've personally seen in a long time, all of my other accounts require $500 which has been a bit of a turn off for me in the past. In addition to the low deposit requirement they also have high yield (by bank standards) 1.05%, which really isn't much but is more than other banks. I think the most attractive thing about CIT is the bonuses for having a certain amount in your account for the first three months of having your account. Now most people will most likely not be able to meet this bonus but I liked it because I happened to have the money to do so. <br/> <br/>I am not a fan of their customer service, as I am almost always handed over to a third party rather than an actual representative. One specific occasion that stands out to me is when I was locked out of my account for forgetting my password. When I called the bank I was forwarded to a general customer service representative. This person had no idea how to help me, nor had any experience in dealing with my issue, when I asked him why he knew nothing about what I was talking about he admitted he just deals with very simple issues such as lost cards. it took us 30 minutes to get a hold of someone that was a bank rep and knew how to recover passwords. All in all the bank itself serves it's purpose, it's got a good Savings program, but just don't lose your account password.",2017-04-04
2320,"Some Good, Some Bad",27333,11926,CIT Bank,38251,2,"Like it may be with many online banks, CIT Bank is good as long as you open an account, make a deposit, and need nothing else. As long as what you are doing does not require you to contact CIT Bank, you will be alright.<br/><br/>However, if for any reason you have to contact them, do not expect much - if anything (other than being on hold and not having your issue resolved). I have one CIT savings account, but decided to open a second to get a $100 bonus - big mistake. The online application seemed simple enough - but I received an error stating, ""Something went wrong. We are sorry, but seems like we are having a system malfunction. We can contact your once we resolve the issues or you can try again later."" I sent them an electronic (internal system) message, but did not hear back after the second day. When I made telephone contact, the representative advised that they would not call me to alert me that the system malfunction had been resolved (then why do they say it in their message).<br/><br/>Three telephone calls later, never with the same representative despite having their names and asking for them, I was consecutively told the following ... That they could see my application had gone through, but were not allowed to tell me the new savings account number. If I logged out and tried again, it would work. It did not. Next, on another call (hold time and all), I was told that the IT Department representative said I could not use the Google Chrome browser to complete a CIT application. I was instructed to use Microsoft Internet Explorer. Still, I received the same error message. On my third call, I was told that my address was too long for the system to recognize and that I needed to add a space to my address so that it was no longer than 7 characters in a row. In the end, it still does not work and no one can explain why.<br/><br/>Their check issuing (mailing me a check for money I am withdrawing from savings) is about average - usually processed in a few days to a week (I have only had to do it a couple times).<br/><br/>In the end, there is a reason that brick & mortar banks are easier - people know you and you get a face-to-face interaction. If you do not mind dealing with 15-20 minute hold times for each call and a representative that is unlikely to be able to resolve an issue in one call, in exchange for significantly higher returns, then CIT (or any online bank) will likely work for you. Perhaps best for the stash it and leave it savings approach. Just do not kid yourself if you think the experience will be similar to a brick & mortar bank.",2017-03-28
2321,Terrible Website / Back-End Systems Very Buggy,27213,11926,CIT Bank,37988,2,"I have banked with CIT since 2014. Initially their website was poorly organized and difficult to use. They revamped their website in 2016 and it actually got even WORSE. It now appears to be a Frankensteinien combination of two different systems.<br/><br/>Their back-end systems and business processes are very cumbersome and not well thought out. It looks like CIT Bank uses a separate website / computer system to open new accounts compared to the system they use to service already existing accounts. These separate systems do not work well with each other and can often get out of synchronization.<br/><br/>For example when I opened a new account and specified that I wanted to fund it via a new external bank account, I was unable to confirm the test deposits sent to the new external account via their regular web site. As I found out later, customers had to return to the website used to open new accounts to verify the newly added external account. There was no documentation about this difference in behavior - customers had to magically figure this out on their own. Their regular website used for existing accounts has it's own separate system of adding and verifying external accounts.<br/><br/>Another example: One cannot open no penalty CD's on CIT bank's website and directly fund them from an existing CIT savings account. Instead you must open your CD's online and specify that they be funded via a check. Then you must call into CIT customer service and ask that they transfer funds from your savings account into the newly opened CD's. Unlike at Ally bank their is no way to redeem or change the interest payment policies of no penalty CD's via CIT's website.<br/><br/>Yet another example: If you hold multiple accounts with CIT bank a separate account statement will be generated for EACH account each month. Other banks like Ally are smart enough to produce a single customer statement each month that incorporates all of your accounts.<br/><br/>The only reason to do business with CIT are the interest rates / special bonus deals - most other aspects of doing business with this bank are clearly inferior compared to most other online banks. (One positive is free outgoing wires for accounts with average balances of > $25K). It now seems clear CIT's strategy is to attract new money with higher rates while leaving established customers languishing with lower rates on previously existing money. <br/><br/>On the customer service front their phone based support is adequate but wait times can be long. One is often left on hold while the customer service staff figure out how to service your request. The background music while you are on hold is highly annoying - silence would be a MUCH better option.<br/><br/>Their online secure message based support is unreliable and very slow to respond - sometimes it seems like they never respond until you call them. I sent a secure message to them on 9/11/2017. A week later they still had not responded to the message. I had to call them before anything was done. I would not rely on their secure message service - they provide no service guarantee. It's more like: ""we will respond to your messages if we feel like it and your request does not require much effort on our part.""<br/><br/>All in all with CIT Bank what you gain in higher interest rates you will lose in wasted time and aggravation dealing with their overall incompetence.<br/><br/>Finally I strongly suspect some of the positive reviews of CIT bank at depositaccounts are illegitimate and have not been left by real customers of this bank. If you read them closely they seem likely to be authored by foreigners / non customers. The only reason sock puppets would leave fake reviews on sites like deposit accounts would be if someone was paying them. I hope that someone at CIT Bank is not behind this effort.",2017-03-21

They resolved the issue immediately, and than I had the check resolved from my client and deposited the corrected check. My client was changing banks at the time.

No charges for wires, maintenance, or online transfers, makes it very easy to get your family savings going. Their savings and CD options are great as well, requiring only $100 and $1,000 to start, respectively. <br/> <br/>There are a few negatives, however. For one, the website is somewhat difficult to navigate, not offering a search feature for instance. Also, the bank does not allow for trusts or retirement options. You can make a TOD account, but your options for future planning is somewhat limited otherwise. Lastly, when I was with them, they had no ATM network.",2016-09-21

2352,Excellent when on the go!,24839,11926,CIT Bank,32518,4,"I have been using this bank for a few years. I wanted something that had a good mobile platform for my phone, so I could do things on the go since I travel a lot for work. Using this bank has made it so much easier to make deposits or transfers on the go. The fees are very reasonable. I have only once had an issue with a transfer, but when I called to work it out they worked so fast it only took couple minutes to correct the problem and they were very helpful!",2016-09-02
2353,CD Closing Experience,24785,11926,CIT Bank,32355,4,"I was able to get CD funds wired out the day after maturity by following these steps:<br/>1. Register the destination bank account as an external account using their trial deposit method. This can be done well in advance and took me one day to activate.<br/>2. Download and fill out the Wire Transfer Authorization Form from their web site, and fax it to the number shown on the form. For same day transfer, the cutoff time is 10:30 a.m. Pacific Time. I faxed it in the evening before the wire was successfully sent.<br/>3. Be available at the phone number linked to your CIT account to answer security questions mostly drawn from your credit report.<br/>4. I also sent a secure message the evening before to alert them of the wire request, but do not know if it was necessary.<br/>Overall I thought it was a reasonable CD closing experience and I would consider depositing funds with them when the rates are good.

I stumbled across this financial institution on a search for a non traditional bank that was not in my area. pretty much for online purposes only. I all ready had a traditional bank account, but I wanted another one for my business purposes only. I enjoy the level of service that CIT has to offer. The bank also gives me optional advise on diversifying my earnings into other portfolios. I had a very sensitive incident not too long ago where I had to make a deposit by a certain time. I called the bank to find out as to when will my deposit post to my account without being penalized. The representative gave me valuable information to complete my deposit in a timely manner which was beneficial for future deposits.",2016-08-21

I inherited them from my One West Bank and attempted to sign in after initial deposit.<br/>I must have spent a total of at least 2 hours over a week or so trying to sign in which was impossible.<br/>I was guided through the same procedures 5 times and was finally told they could not figure it out.<br/>I asked them to transfer my monty to another bank and they informed me they cannot do that since I have to do it online. Obviously it is impossible to transfer online when I cannot sign into my account. Impossible to believe that a bank cannot transfer money to another bank. They have to send a check taking a week.

In the three years that I have had accounts with CIT Bank, they have messed up every single request or procedure. Now, since their recent 'security update', I cannot access my online account because (after two previous requests) they have not updated my phone number so that I can receive a temporary password. When I call Customer Service for help, they transfer me to Fraud Prevention, who transfers me back to Customer Service. I am now locked in a battle with them to get my Roth IRA funds transferred to another trustee, but since I can't access my online account, I don't know the specific account numbers of the CD's I have.

So far I haven't had any particular issues with CIT, but I did have an issue where I had a problem depositing my money. I called customer service and found that something triggered their security system. Luckily it was just a false alarm.

When I called them, I was on hold for over 15 minutes twice and hanged up as soon as the customer service learned I needed to close the accounts. Finally I spoke with a real person. She told me my external account info was lost when they updated their system. I could either request a check or reset up, either method could take several days. I requested a check, and followed up the following day. Nothing happened yet (obviously it would take several days for them to cut a check). At the same time, I reset up the external checking account, provided 2 test deposit amount. The system told me the external account was ready to use, but I was still not able to transfer fund. I called again, and I was told it would take another 2-3 days. They had no issues when I opened the CD accounts, and made it very difficult for me to get my own money out of CIT. I will not use them again even though their CD rate is slightly higher. It is totally not worth it.",2016-07-12
2361,Even Better Months after the OneWest Merger,24327,11926,CIT Bank,31316,5,"I was a customer of OneWest Bank (now a division of CIT), which prided itself on exceptional and personal customer service but sometimes lacked the slick systems and range of products of larger banks. When CIT acquired OneWest, I worried that OneWest would lose its personal touch and start imposing a lot of fees. I have been pleasantly surprised. OneWest has kept its personal touch while acquiring the sophistication and competitive products of a much larger bank. The transition has been very smooth, with no noticeable negative differences in the branches, statements, or website, except that now the tellers are reminding me that the rate they're offering on savings is now much higher. The employees seem happy as well, which is a great sign. This company restored my faith that banking can still be a pleasant experience.",2016-07-08

It was fine until they recently changed their online banking backend. I had to call in to get set up and access my account, which was annoying but acceptable. However, when I tried to transfer money to my non-CIT checking account (which I had done many times with the past system), I could not because they need to confirm by phone number but my international phone number is not showing up. Again, annoying but not why I would give them one star. The problem is I have been trying to reach customer service now for four days, I keep getting into the voice mail system but then when it tries to connect me it disconnects me saying all circuits are busy. I cannot believe it is even legal for them not to provide a way to contact the bank (I have literally tried more than 25 times, all at times during their operating hours). There is a reason that I have a regular savings account, so I can access my money, and I can't even access the bank. This is ridiculous and dangerous (and probably illegal).",2016-07-03

Instead of allowing me to correct the error CIT insists that I send a copy of my wife's ss card. I do not fell comfortble in maiing or faxing this.<br/>The fact that CIT somehow recognized the error means that they could also check out that the revised number is correct but choose not to. If CIT is this difficult to deal with when I'm trying to open an account and give them money I do not want to have to deal with it if a real issue arises.<br/>I'll find another bank.,2016-05-02

2368,Earn Best Rate With Cit Bank,23652,11926,CIT Bank,29520,4,"What initially drew me to CIT bank was the high interest rates that they offered. They are at the top of what is offered for online bank accounts. That is significantly higher than physical bank accounts. They only allow 6 withdrawals from the account per cycle, but that is a standard of most online banks. There aren't any fees for opening an account. However, you need to have at least $100 in your account or they will begin to charge you. Similar to other online banks you have to apply to be a member. It takes a few days and I had to fill out an application which did not take that much effort. Once a member, I was able to link my new online account to an existing bank account I had at another bank to transfer money in. It was pretty easy to move around funds to where they should be. I'm quite satisfied so far because I have done much better than just letting it sit and not earn any interest.",2016-04-14

I decided to try CIT bank because the interest is so much better than local banks. Recently, I had a couple of large payments due in a few days for which I didn't have enough money in my local bank account. So I put in a transfer request from my CIT account to my local account. The transfer said ""successful"" and I had a confirmation #. The money never got transferred to my checking account so I went back to my CIT account and the transfer had been inexplicably cancelled even though I had more than sufficient funds. I quickly put in another transfer but it was too late to make it to my checking account in time and so my account was overdrawn and resulted in fees. Upon contacting CIT, they could not give me a satisfactory reason as to why my transfer never occurred even though I got a confirmation # and said they would not reimburse me my local bank fees. I have closed my accounts and will stick to my local bank in the future. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL bank and not worth the better interest rate! AVOID this bank!!",2016-03-28

Using the online interface has been really simple and easy. It's interesting to note that even though I have not been with them all that long, I've still had the change to work my way through their system and really get used to their features.

In terms of location and ATM access, I think your local bank or a larger branch bank is more appropriate for day to day use as it allows for free ATM access. This bank currently has a rate of 1.05% on its savings products while similar competitors like AMEX has .90%, Ally with 1.00%, and Capital One 360 with .75%.

It was very apt for my needs as it provided good interest rates as compared to other competitors. Its website is very user friendly to use and also their replies are prompt . They take time to resolve your queries to your satisfaction . I observed it in the beginning when I had some problems setting up my account . I was always updated of the proceedings and everything got resolved in a timely manner .Their is no maintenance fee which is a highlight . This is highly useful as I run a small scale business with high sales volumes at times . During those days it gives me good returns which I use during non sales season. I was very delighted by their services. Its worth recommending to family and friends. I have had no complaints with them what so ever .

The website is very secure (almost too secure at times!) They require several safeguards, and if you do anything their algorithms consider out of the ordinary, it might even kick you off! I had that happen once or twice. But I considered it a blessing because it decreased the likelihood someone would be able to hack my account.

Though they are an online bank, they have better customer service than brick and mortar banks I've been to. Rather than waiting in line for hours, only to see a representative that quite obviously doesn't care about your account unless you're also using their investment aspects, CIT Bank representatives have always been quick to reply and help me. Whether I had an issue or wanted a quick question answered, calling CIT Bank always gave me a quick answer without having to wait in line or be on hold for ages. Their online and mobile access was also far more accessible to use than other banks with better security. When I lost my password they went through a rigorous check to make sure that I was the account-holder. I felt safer knowing that only I would be able to satisfy the requirements to get my password from them. Many other banks just have you answer one or two questions like, ""What is your mother's maiden name?""

They are very nice over the phone and really didn't come off as to busy or at all impolite. This is a real selling point for me because usually in today's market customer service is one separates the good from the bad. It also makes issues a lot easier to understand when you aren't blamed for them. Luckily I have yet to have any issue to really need customer service, which is a good thing also. Of course I haven't been with them long so hopefully I can report back later if this changes. The online website is very nice on a desktop computer or laptop.

Many other banks provide much better online experience compared to CIT. I do not understand why they are lacking on this issue.

I also wanted to sit on it and have it grow interest. My child is 4 years old so I don't plan on the money being used for a while. I did some research and found that CIT Bank had one of the best rates for CD accounts at about 2% at the time. So I went through their enrollment form and transferred the money from a different credit union bank to the CIT Bank. It literally took less than 48 hrs to have the money transferred and I setup the account for 5 years.

What was once a big bank who made you feels as if you were dealing with a small bank is no longer prevalent. <br/>Lately, CIT has failed to process payments efficiently. I do understand this also ties into how a merchant processes a payment as well. But CIT should find a more proficient way of handling this, especially when items remain pending for a long period of time. This puts me in a uncompromising situation concerning my account and I am now being charged repetitive fees like T.D BANK. If I am going to have to put up with the same inconsideration for its customers like T.D BANK, what is the point of staying with your bank?

Luckily for me, they had their best representatives on the line when I called who assisted me in sorting out the problem nearly immediately. In addition to the polite, quick help I received, I was allowed a waiver as this was my first time with the problem and had maintained a good relationship moving up to this point. To me, customer service and a willingness to throw in a hand and help out when possible on the banks part is very important- and in all of these areas, they have exceeded my expectations.

When the feds were foreclosing on some banks back then, CIT got taken over for a short time and I feared losing my investment - but everything was fine and completely intact. They have great CD rates - so competitive perhaps because they are on-line only, with no bricks and mortar banks to pay for and staff - so sometimes less really is more for the consumer. You'll be hard-pressed to find better interest rates. Equally important, the customer service is good and they respond to requests quickly. They've hung in with me through moves to several states. Once they let me switch to a 2-year CD to get a higher rate even though I'd already locked it in as a 1-year. They even helped me out last year when I bought a house and needed a special document from CIT for the mortgage approval - they went above and beyond. One tiny matter: their Web site, once you're inside your account, is a bit slow and clunky and not as slick as those of big retail banks - but it's secure and reliable.

I appreciate that financial institutions are attempting to upgrade their internet security, but this is ridiculous. Security questions/responses are not what is being hacked, as far as I know. And, the drop down menu of preselected questions is a joke (on most all sites, too) but even worse when you have to select new ones.<br/>I have only rolled over my CDs, so I have no experience on getting my money back out.

I prefer their jumbo CDs however, while they have a higher minimum limit they pay more over the short and mid-term than anything else. However I have also got a Term CD for 5 years with them which requires just 1% of the minimum balance to open an account as a Jumbo CD but only a tenth of a percent less over the 5 year period in earnings. <br/> <br/>CIT's customer service is really quite good too; several times I had questions that most banks would have referred me to a FAQ or site. As a new investor and more importantly as a first time banker with CIT I was given exceptional service and information that went far above and beyond what I have come to accept as normal with most other banks.",2015-01-19

2391,CIT Bank's CD Account,19601,11926,CIT Bank,21209,5,"CIT Bank is an online banking vehicle I began to use two months ago when I was in search of a little more return on my money than my local bank was giving. CIT Bank advertised a Jumbo CD account detailing that I could receive up to 2.35% APY on my money. Since I am the type of investor who is looking for a little growth and much security to my money as I near retirement age, I felt the CIT Bank's CD rates were competitive enough, and would still lend me peace of mind that all of my money is not allocated in risky investment vehicles. I've only called customer service once and the woman I spoke with was friendly and helpful when I hit a glitch online setting up my account. My interest rate on this account is compounded daily, FDIC-insured, and allows me to manage my account online pretty easily. There were no monthly account maintenance fees or fees to open up the account at all, however, there is a minimum balance requirement that must be met and a time requirement to receive the 2.35% APY which I'm glad I was able to meet.",2015-01-06
2392,So far so good,19232,11926,CIT Bank,20807,4,"Recently opened a savings account with CIT and it was pretty painless. Their interest rate is competitive, not the best but far from the worst. They are very nice over the phone and really didn't come off as to busy or at all impolite. This is a real selling point for me because usually in todays market customer service is one separates the good from the bad. It also makes issues a lot easier to understand when you aren't blamed for them. Luckily I have yet to have any issue to really need customer service, which is a good thing also. Of course I haven't been with them long so hopefully I can report back later if this changes. <br/> <br/>The online website is very nice on a desktop computer or laptop. I haven not used it on a smartphone as of yet but I would suspect that the quality would remain there also.",2014-12-16
2393,Inconsistent+Unhelpful customer service,19231,11926,CIT Bank,20806,3,"I recently opened a CIT savings account because they boasted really great interest rates. However, within two weeks they changed the policy and the rates dropped. That was disappointing but not completely surprising. I didn't have any problems for several weeks after that, but then one day I tried to transfer funds into my account and was unable to. I decided to call customer service, figuring this would be an easy problem to fix. <br/> <br/>I was on hold for 20 solid minutes before I gave up and decided to just send an email inquiry. I didn't hear back for three days, and when I did, they just said I needed to contact the other bank where I was trying to wire from. Shouldn't they have some lines of communication set up already? I thought that was very strange. I did follow through and call my other bank, who reported that they've had frequent issues in transferring funds to CIT and other online banks. <br/> <br/>I'm contemplating just closing my account and transferring all funds back to original bank. CIT is okay at face value, but they really don't seem to have themselves together.",2014-12-16

I was advised I could ACH transfer the proceeds by giving a bank name, account #, and routing number. I provided those and was told I would receive a confirmation on these instructions. No confirmation after two weeks, so I asked about it again. No confirmation after a total of 3 weeks.<br/><br/>The CD matured on 11/13/14 and I was advised on that day that the ACH transfer could not happen because I had not previously verified the transfer account. Of course, I had given myself a month lead time and could have easily done this had CIT just confirmed my instructions to ACH transfer or clarified that I needed to verify. Now I am trying to just get a check snail mailed to me.<br/><br/>Very disappointing given the month lead time I had provided to get this right.",2014-11-14

The people who I dealt with on a daily basis were extremely professional, courteous, and genuinely wanted and appreciated my business. My only complaints are as follows. It felt like I was strictly a commodity and not an essential asset in growing their business. When I presented my account and my offer, I was met with a very nonchalant vibe towards my expected growth and capability. I feel that if I had been treated more fairly, I would continue to do business with this particular bank. I feel customer service should be the number one priority at ANY financial institution, and CIT Bank did not fulfill this requirement for me. Overall, I would still rank this bank a 3 out of 5, for their excellent rate options and overall financial plan.",2014-11-05

On top of that, you must have pop-ups unblocked and there are some aspects of the site that don't seem to work on Chrome. Now, the people I've talked to have been very courteous - although, I've gotten different answers to the same questions from different reps. The good news is that their rates are a tad higher than other places and they're FDIC insured. Maybe they take what they save on web design and devote it to paying interest - although, I think they lose any savings due to customers having to call their help line. Is it worth it? That's your call.",2014-10-10

2398,Bank on CIT,18106,11926,CIT Bank,19342,5,"CIT Bank, not to be confused with Citi bank, is one of the best FDIC insured online banks I have been able to find. I originally opened a savings account a year ago with a $25,000 deposit and I qualified for a 1.00% interest rate! The rates at this bank are far above many of the popular banks such as Chase and Bank of America. If you have at least 25k in your account you qualify for the larger interest rate, anything below 25k is .05% less interest rate, which isn't bad. <br/>The site is well maintained and easy to use and the interest is added up every day and deposited monthly. It's nice to see how you money is growing everyday. Wire transfers are simple, as well as connecting all your accounts to your CIT account. The only downside is your money gets tied up for a few days when you transfer. But there's a price to pay for the security of your money and this is well worth it.",2014-09-29

Little did I know, they initiated a verification of all my available funds in account and started contacting all my bank from where I had done ACH transfer using CIT portal after going through Trial deposit. My wire transfer was not processed on the same day. Of course, all of this was done under the pretext of my own safety, security and fraud prevention. Just FYI : to stay away from this Bank.

The customer service answers quickly and handles everything I through at them. You have to get them set a lot of stuff up if you want to use it. No biggy. My only complaint is that you cannot export in Quicken format from their website. I did not know that when I signed up but the rate of .95 is worth the hassle.

I use the reviews as a guide but they do not normally make or break my decision to open an account.<br/>So I was bit hesitant about opening an account with CIT Bank due to a lot of negative reviews. Did not encounter any issues during the entire opening process. Their customer service even got back me in timely fashion to a couple questions. After the initial fund transfer to open the account I added a bank to transfer more funds. The test deposits were made and approved and I transferred more money into the account. <br/>Most of the negative comments I read are not recent so maybe they did some internal cleansing to address the complaints.",2014-03-04

What's worse, they said it would take two additional days to have the feature added to my account.  Fine, I'll wait.  But lo, two days later, I check my account for the transfer option, and they say that I need to maiil a copy of my driver's license in?  I waited two days to be told this??  Seriously, they are stuck in the 70s with this kind of service.  I am seriously considering kicking them to the curb and finding another online bank to keep my emergency fund in.  Do I really want to go through this kind of old-fashioned rigamrole when I need to access my emergency funds??  Will I have to make my request by fax or a telegram or something?  I wish I never opened the account.",2013-05-24

I also have a good deal of money coming due from traditional banks that offer .025% for renewals, so I am having those banks mail redemptions to my credit union money market account. Although it was painful to open the initial CDs at CIT originally, I decided to open more CDs with CIT because of their interest rates. First day: I entered all of my information and all of the sudden I was logged out and lost all of the data I inputed. I couldn't go through that process again until my blood pressure went down. Following day; Just when I was close to inputting all of the required information (except for a problem that required me to phone customer service), blammy: I was logged off again. I called customer service. The agent was able to locate the information I typed in but then had to ask security questions from my initial CD accounts. Fine. Then, to open the new CD accounts, I was asked for passport/drivers license number, social security card, and a utility bill with my address on it. I replied that I have passport scan on file that I can email as an attachment and that I am at the same address as when I took out the initial CDs. He replied that I would still have to send a copy of my utility bill showing my address. Blood pressure problem again. I replied that I would not complete the process and asked him to make a note to not renew the CDs I had with CIT when they matured, but to mail the checks to the address that CIT has on file for them.

Once they get your money, they do everything possible to prevent or delay giving it back. They deducted money from my account for a very large wire they were supposed to send, but then refused to send the wire. Later they said they had a two week hold on checks, but it was more than two weeks, and they still would not send the wire. I became very concerned that they were in financial trouble, and that they really were not able to wire out a very large amount of money. Before that, they told me they had the right to a 30 day delay, but I checked that out with another bank and was told that was not true. The wire was supposed to go out Monday, 10/29/12. But, they could not find the paperwork -- which they eventually did. Then, we were promised that it would go out Wednesday -- which it did not, and they did not tell us. On Friday, I spent the entire day trying to get them to send it. With much difficulty, they finally sent it very late afternoon on Friday. This ensured that I could not use that money until next week. Customer service people have little or no authority. It seems that they have a policy of delay which refers things to their business office. I left three messages with their vice president and he did not return those calls. I waited a full 15 minutes on their home office general line, but the receptionist was, ""still busy with other callers"". Only after I threatened legal action through another location did he answer the phone. I did finally get them to send the wire, but only after threatening legal action with a couple of people, and the matter was escalated to ""the highest office"". The extra 10 basis points of interest is definately not worth the time and the risk of dealing with this kind of organization. I will definitely close out my CIT account, because their delaying tactics and deceit have convinced me that they are either too arrogant and uncaring about their customers -- or much worse.

How ridiculous is that? THE ACCOUNT HAD ALREADY BEEN FUNDED INITIALLY WITH MY ACH INFORMATION. After learning that, I had enough so I called again and asked that my account be closed. They couldn’t close it that day because they said a hold was still on the initial ACH deposit and the hold lasts five business days. It had already been six business days!

Transfer happens fast. Usually I see the transfer the next business day.

So I call up the bank from out of the country and they expedite the card to me for free to a different country and move my money over the phone to help me get by in the mean time.,2018-05-14
2468,Mixed,33078,791,American Express National Bank,50086,4,"My experience with American Express Bank has been mixed at best. I no longer have an account with them due to some of the issues I've had. While I admit their online tools and applications are quite easy to navigate. Their customer service, not so much. I've had my card locked several times for everyday purchases. Working with them to get it unlocked was long and time consuming in the middle of a store. The fees for late payments aren't too bad, but they don't give you the best time windows on that. In addition they're not the most forgiving. Like a lot of banks, they use a technicality to squeeze some change out of you. It might not seem much, but it adds up. Generall their staff are polite. But their practices need some revision in the customer service department.",2018-05-07
2469,Savings Account that leaves alot to be desired,33058,791,American Express National Bank,50066,2,"I have had my savings account since November 2015. It's a very basic account. I am annoyed they do not offer a mobile app or like many other banks a traditional checking. The savings can be linked to transfer money in and out of, but it does take an extra day to prices and reflect in the account. You can't make a mobile deposit and there are no branches to go into. Not always a convenient option. The website is nice and simple and again allows you to move money into and out of your other accounts, once they have been verified. If you do need to speak to someone, and have the misfortune of needing to call, be aware their call center seems to be sourced from another country and you likely will not get any help. It's frustrating and unfortunate as I am considering closing my savings.",2018-05-04
2470,Good Option but inconvenient,32988,791,American Express National Bank,49954,4,"I have a savings account with American Express Bank and while I like the online portal and customer service, it is not as convenient as having a local bank to visit. I use the online system multiple times a week which is easy and quick. However, for multiple check deposits or cash withdrawal it would be nice to be able to visit a physical location. Overall, I receive high quality service when there is an issue. The fees are a bit high, but I do not want to have to go through the trouble of switching banks.",2018-04-29
2471,Great Bank,32978,791,American Express National Bank,49943,4,"I have been banking with American Express checking for 4 years now. Their website on mobile is very used friendly and accounts update immediately after a transaction. Accounts often update balance immediately after transaction (sure has payment) has been made within American Express account network, which is very nice for bookkeeping. I have never had any issues that were not immediately remedied, and any issues I have had were not the fault of American Express, but more just merchant errors. American Express has reasonable fees and interest rates on deposit accounts and is very transparent when it comes to servicing account. I like that they make clear how you can avoid fees and they don't hide this information in small print that no one reads. Customer service is always fast and friendly and very efficient. American Express clearly is always striving to improve functionality and service.",2018-04-28
2472,"A great option for a lot of people, but not the best for mobile users.",32948,791,American Express National Bank,49907,4,"I have enjoyed using American Express as one of my savings options. What drew me most to use American Express are their interest rates. When I was searching around for banks, they were among the highest, and easily one of the more trusted names. Some of the other banks with higher interest rates were not banks I'd ever heard of, and I would feel unsafe dumping money into a bank I'd only just heard of. What I really don't like about American Express is their mobile app. I have not found anywhere that you can upload a check VIA camera. My local bank has the option of just taking a picture of the front and back of a check, and it's deposited within 24 hours usually. I really don't like the fact that I have to mail in my deposits, but it's something I can overlook given the interest rates.",2018-04-26
2473,American Express Bank,32927,791,American Express National Bank,49887,5,I use American Express Bank for checking and saving. I like them they don't charge to many fees. I don't have to keep a minimum balance. Which is great because you won't get penalize and lose money while making them money. The customer service is good when you call them not great sometimes you need to ask to speak to a manger because they seem to not comprehend when you ask them a question about direct deposit now this only happened to me once but all their staff should be better trained in questions. I will add though a year ago I had my info stole and my debit card from them was being used and they cancelled all transactions and I got my money back quickly. All in all it is pretty decent banking.,2018-04-24
2474,American Express Above and Beyond,32919,791,American Express National Bank,49881,3,I have banked with American Express bank and entrusted then with my direct deposits for over 4 years now. It was by far the best banking decision I ever made. For starters there are never any over draft fees or negitive balances. I have multiple accounts with different cards that I can easily move money around to and I even have a saving account with them that's actually helping me save money. My favorite thing about this bank is their customer service. I'm never on hold or talking to the automated phone person. Any issue I have ever had was resolved swiftly and I felt like my time mattered to them.,2018-04-24
2475,Great Use And Works Okay With Some Minimal Negatives,32918,791,American Express National Bank,49880,4,"Overall American Express Bank is pretty good. I used the online personal savings account to save some money for a few things I needed and I just wanted to be able to have some extra money for any type of unexpected situation. The account works good because you can link it to your personal accounts and then add money to it whenever you like. One thing I didn't like about it was how they have no physical retail locations to go. I like being able to go to a store or location and wait in line to deposit money myself. With this account I could only do it online. <br/> <br/>Another benefit is the high interest rate they give you for the savings account. This is great for those who like letting their money build up. It's one of the many things that I love about this account. I also like how there is no fees involved with the account such as no minimum balance that is needed and there isn't any monthly fees. I did use an ATM once and they did charge me a fee for using it but it still was a minimal amount but that's a small setback. <br/> <br/>The customer service is pretty good. I've called and spoke to a rep before when I had some concerns about taking out money from my account and the rep assured me of what the whole process is and any necessary information I needed. She told me that I can only take out money up to six times a month to avoid any fees or issues. I wasn't aware of this when I signed up. Other than that, I had no problems with them at all and everything went smooth.",2018-04-23
2476,"American Express, Great Savings but Slow",32907,791,American Express National Bank,49869,4,"For 10 years I had been using Branch Banking and Trust (BB&T) for my checking account and savings accounts. The interest I was receiving on the savings account was amounting to pennies. This was just after the financial crisis so interest rates were like .01%. Once I started my first full time job in 2016, I was interested in taking charge of my finances. One of the first things I did was get an American Express Cashback Credit Card. While I was browsing the products offered by American Express, I came across their online only savings account. At the time (late 2016) the interest rate was 1%, almost 100 times what my current interest rate was and with no fees attached. I immediately transferred all of my savings money to my newly opened American Express Savings Account. The online interface was clunky, but easy enough to follow. I was able to set up transfers between my bank and external bank accounts. However, I found two things limiting that ultimately caused me to end my relationship with American Express Bank. The first is I like to check my account balances frequently. American Express Bank did not offer a mobile app, so I would have to login through a laptop or desktop if I wanted to know my balance. Transfers between accounts took between 5 and 7 business days. At one point, I needed a large amount of money to cover a deductible. The money didn't come fast enough and it caused me a lot of worry. Because of this, even though I was getting more interest, I needed peace of mind and ready access to my money, so I moved to a different bank. The only time I used AE customer service was to close my account, which was painless and quick.",2018-04-22

My acceptance was prompt and I received all information necessary to set up and start using my savings account. Second, I loved the fact that there are no fees and no minimum deposit amount required to open the account. I am also able to link other American Express accounts and transfer from one account to the other. This is very convenient for paying my credit card bill and keep my funds above zero, without having to access a physical bank.",2018-04-21
2478,American Express Online Savings Account,32893,791,American Express National Bank,49855,4,"I originally only had an american express credit card, which I have had for about five years. About a year ago, I decided to find an online savings account since the interest rates were so much better than many of the large brick and mortar banks. American express was consistently one of the top recommended banks, so I went with there savings account. The online application was very easy to fill out and probably only took 5 minutes or so. The interest rate was around 1.1% and is consistently raised when the FED increases rates. The online account is easy to navigate and as always the customer service is superb from American Express.",2018-04-21
2479,The king of customer service American Express,32886,791,American Express National Bank,49848,4,"I have always been a satisfied customer with American Express. They were the first to approve me for a credit card and I have always been happy with their amazing customer service over the years. When I started saving up a good amount of money I was shopping around for a good bank with a good interest rate on their savings. I was referred by reddit personal finance and American Express was on their list for good online banks for savings. At the time they were offering 1.35% and while it's not the highest of the banks, I know their customer service will make up for it. Just like having a amex credit card account, their savings page has all the tools you need. The account page is easy to navigate and UI is very clean and colorful. There are no monthly fees which I liked. I have it linked on my Bank of America Checkings on the same day and I have had no reported issues so far. I can access all my info whenever I want and they even have an onsite chat service if you have any questions. I have only been banking with them for a few months but I am very happy overall so far.",2018-04-21
2480,American Express Review,32880,791,American Express National Bank,49842,4,"I have banked with American Express for several years now and have had a pleasant experience. It is probably one of the better banks I've had an account with compared to Bank of America and Chase. My biggest compliment to American Express is their customer service. I have been in the military for about seven years now. In that time, I have had to travel to many different places. Several of these places were within the continental United States, and several were outside, specifically Germany, England, and Qatar. A quick email or phone call to the bank to let them know that I would be moving, or spending time somewhere new was all that it took to make sure my accounts and cards were good to go no matter where I went. Also, I believe they have the most user friendly website of the current banks I am using. I can easily see my account information, any statements, and any rewards I have accrued. They are a friendly and user accessible bank and I would recommend it to others.",2018-04-20

I feel safe putting my money in this bank, because of the top notch security and i am assured my money will be safe.

Its as though you are part of a secret club. I am constanty looking for the best bank accounts that I can get the most bang for my buck from. I came across American Express when we were looking for another banking acount to compliment our Barclays account. We usually go for high interest savings with low or no fees. American Express banking offers the highest savings interset rate of all the banks I have found. Setting up my account was simple. The customer service team goes above and beyond to make sure you are getting to most our of your relationship with AMEX.

2483,Great Investment,32586,791,American Express National Bank,49301,5,"I have recently opened up a certificate of deposit (CD) with American Express. I have found that their annual percentage yield (APY) is very competitive and much higher than most other banks. Additionally, they allow you to choose several different options for how long you want to wait until your CD matures, as well as different rates based on this time span. The application process was very easy and was done almost entirely online. All I had to do was follow the steps on their website, provide the necessary information and await their approval, and then link my other bank accounts in order to fund my CD. I have also contacted the bank in order to gain further information about their CDs, and they answered my questions in great detail and made me feel very confident that using this bank was a great decision. I currently have a 24 month CD and have earned a substantial amount of money from it. I plan to continue using this bank to invest my money and increase my overall wealth. Another great option they provide is that you can use the interest earned from your CD to either further fund your CD, or receive the interest in the form of a check or have it transferred to another bank account. I have chosen to allow the interest to further increase the amount in my CD so that I can gain more money this way. Overall, I am very pleased with this bank and would highly suggest it to those wanting to open and fund a CD in order to save their money and gain additional money in the process.",2018-03-31

The reason I decided to use American Express Bank was because other institution were providing me very low APY. At first was unsure if I wanted to use American Express Bank for the reason that it was an internet only bank. However, to my surprise, this bank exceeded my expectations. The online services were quick and easy to use, and I really found the whole experience hassle free. Being that this was the first time I ever used an online only bank account, I was worried about depositing my funds and also retrieving them. However, transactions for American Express Bank was both easy an reliable. In addition, American Express Bank's customer service is always concise and very helpful.

When I had gone to open my savings account, the banker was helpful, kind, and made sure to ask if there was anything I would be confused about or would need help on. They helped me determine what would give me the highest yield or would be the best account to open up. As this was the first time I had done this, the clerk spent an ample amount of time helping me out. The certificate of deposit account was what I ultimately chose, as this fit my lifestyle needs better than the high yield savings account.",2018-03-19

I like the ease of this account usage. I can easily transfer money to and from another account, even different bank. Right now we have it set up so that each month a certain amount will be transferred to this saving account from our regular checking account. So far we have not had any issues that require us to contact the customer service regarding this account.

I keep about 6300 in the APY account so that I can get back a good amount for keeping it there at a 100% certainty that I won't loose my money.

They are always able to help me and answer my questions that i have about the savings account that i have through their bank. The personal savings account is the best thing that i can find in terms of saving for personal growth.

I just wanted the simplest card so I could get airline miles but it took awhile for them to get me the right card that I wanted.

I do like the fact that I can access my account 24/7 because I sometimes remember silly details or the fact that I need to transfer money so I can pay off a bill at unconventional times.

One of my favorite benefits is that they have their own travel agency and you can use your points to redeem travel. The travel agency also has great customer service and they are very friendly. It is nice to be able to take a vacation and use my points to cover the airfare and hotel costs.,2018-03-07
2506,My experience with American Express,32093,791,American Express National Bank,48378,3,"I had to switch banks when I moved between states since my old bank didn't have any branches in the new location. I ended up opening an account with American Express bank that happened to be in the area based on a recommendation from a friend. I was pretty pleased with the experience, at least compared to my old bank. They had no fees for the type of account I was opening and my old bank did. I was only with them for a year before I moved again, but it was a decent experience and if there were any local branches where I am now I would likely still be with them.",2018-03-06
2507,American Express Personal Savings Account,32081,791,American Express National Bank,48359,5,"A few months ago I was looking around to different banks to open a personal savings account. The fees for a savings account through the bank I currently have a checking account with were too high, so I didn't want to open a savings account with them. I ended up choosing an American Express personal savings account, and have been very happy with the service I've received up to this point. The best thing about an American Express savings account is that there are NO fees and NO minimums. These two things are super important to me because I believe that my money is my own, and if I want to put $10 in one month, and $100 in another month I should be able to do so without worrying about fees and minimums. It also links easily to my current checking account and I can transfer money back and forth as needed. The website has been very user friendly, and I haven't even needed to reach out to customer service with any issues.",2018-03-06

I've had nothing but fantastic experience with their customer service. I don't often dig into my savings, but I often add to it and I have had no issues transferring money in or out (on the rare occasion) with AmEx. I've only talked to their customer service several times (3-4), but each time I talked to a banking rep I was greeted with resounding competence and quick and clear helpful discussion. I highly recommend them as a savings bank.",2018-03-02
2509,American Express Savings - High Interest Rate with No Minimum Deposit,32050,791,American Express National Bank,48328,5,"The American Express High Yield Savings Account offers one of the highest interest rates among online-only banks. I was a long time Capital One 360 customer, until I found that American Express offers a higher rate, with no minimum. I was able to set up my account pretty quickly and link it to another checking account. From there, I was able to transfer money whenever I wanted. It's very straightforward, and the interest rate makes it worthwhile.",2018-03-02
2510,My Savings Account,32029,791,American Express National Bank,48306,3,"I started a savings account to help me save for future vacations. I picked American Express. I have really nothing bad to say about them. It was always easy to deposit money for the most part. Never had any issues accept some short delays here and there. Anytime there was some kind of issue, it was always pretty easy to talk to someone. There were not many issues at all but when there was it was taken care of. I ended up leaving the bank because I just didn't think it was really necessary for me anymore. It had nothing to do with them. I would recommend this bank for anyone starting up a savings account. It maybe inst the best out there but if your looking for something that is trouble free, then there you go!",2018-02-27
2511,Serve is Great for Direct Deposit,32008,791,American Express National Bank,48281,4,"American Express Bank is a great online banking option...if you have a monthly direct deposit. If you do, the $4.95/month fee is waived. If not, that is quite a high fee, in my opinion. It has been easy to find in-network, fee-free atm's. The website and app experience is great. Very easy, very secure. I like that you can create subaccounts for different expenses or savings goals.",2018-02-24

However, once I was locked out of my account because I had put in the incorrect password multiple times, but when I called, they were able to help me really fast and did it with a really good attitude. Anytime I needed to call someone, they have been very considerate to me and what I need. I've had a more positive experience with them than I have with any other bank I've used.",2018-02-23

Online banking is easy to understand and reliable. When and if I have an issue, I can always call their customer service number. The customer service agents are competent, polite, and genuinely seem as though they care. It has been apparent to me that customer service is of great importance to this institution. The best thing is that it is linked to my credit cards and check cards. This is extremely convienent as I can handle all of my needed processes with one agent on the phone, or with the click of a button online. I truthfully cannot say enough positive things about this bank and feel everyone should use their services. I don't see myself changing banks any time soon!",2018-02-21
2515,American Express Bank,31763,791,American Express National Bank,47829,4,"I was with this bank for a decent amount of time. I originally signed up as a young child and just recently switched banks. I really never had any complaints about them. They were always helpful and took time to answer all of my questions. I was very happy when they started to provide access to online banking. That was a huge plus in my eyes. I recently changed banks merely to have easier access to my money. I am much more satisfied with my bank now, merely because there are many more of them and I can drive down the street to deposit or withdrawal money. I would consider switching back to this bank if they offered some kind of promotional. It is just hard to beat accessibility.",2018-02-15

They offer the highest APR I could find and there are no minimum balance requirements. Thankfully I never had to use their customer service, but after using the credit card customer service I am confident their team would be great as well. I did work with American Express to transfer my money from my old savings account company to open my new account, and they were great. The American Express website is really easy to use and works well on my Iphone as well. It is especially easy to transfer money between your American Express accounts and to pull up your monthly statements in PDF form. I'm looking forward to making lots of money in this new savings account!",2018-02-12

I have a savings account with American Express and also a checking account with American Express Serve. I had some unknown charges on my account and after contacting customer service about it, it was cleared up immediately. They removed the charges with no problem. The only cons to banking with American Express is that I have a monthly checking account fee (which is reasonable, but other banks offer free checking.) and that I've had several encounters with stores that do not take american express, I wish American Express would try harder to get their cards accepted everywhere.",2018-02-09

It was secure and had name recognition, so I didn't have to worry if my money was going to be safe in the bank or not. I also liked the associated fees, which I found to be less than the other banks I was looking at. The biggest thing that really attracted me to them even more was their superior customer service. One day, I had misplaced my wallet, and someone had use my debit card and money was taken out of my account. I called them up, and they were quick to reverse that transaction and deposit the money back in my account within 24 hours. It was amazing!

Even thought this bank is only online, they have great customer service. You can call them and it directed to the customer service very quickly. They also have a phone app which you can use to keep track of your checking and saving balance. However, I did have a few unhappy experience in transferring money to my another bank account.

In my opinion on of the best in the world, they offer a great percentage rate that easily competes with other online banks. But to me the best thing about AMEX is their customer service. You can withdraw your money from your savings an it will be in your account in no less than 2 days. Talk about fast! Also their website is very easy to navigate. Very hard to get lost. Everything is precise and concise. Also you can connect your saving's with your credit account so you can easily move between the two. I highly recommend getting a saving's account with American Express. Their ease of use is a high point plus your money is making more money and its in safe hands with one of the best banks in the world.

2526,Best Banks For Savings Products,31069,791,American Express National Bank,46723,5,"I was first turned on to American Express Bank 3 years ago by a friend who's been a long time customer. He recommended I give American Express Bank (AEB) a try when I mentioned I was looking for savings products and CDs. I've not been disappointed. AEB's CD rates are competitive and the fees associated with the accounts have been great. It's an online only bank, which means you don't have all the fees associated with going into a branch location. They have an app that makes tracking your savings balances and accounts simple, and straightforward. I don't have to guess what my current growth rate is or go through a litany of menu options when I want information on a particular account, or to check rates on new offerings. I also enjoy the fact that I can easily link my accounts at other institutions to my AEB savings to allow for easy transfers and withdrawals.",2018-01-14
2527,Nothing to Write Home About,31044,791,American Express National Bank,46694,3,"I chose to open an account with American Express after having a poor experience with another company. I was drawn in to the high APY rate and supposed ease of use. The reason why I say that there was nothing to write home about is exactly that. It is an okay bank, but honestly the features seem no different than any other institution. The app frequently freezes and logs me out. The ""fast"" transfer rate is the same as their competitors. I called the bank to see if any other features could be applied to my account because of my solid FICO, but there was nothing else the woman could do. She also seemed very new to the subject of banking as she was not able to provide any additional information that I did not already know going into the call.",2018-01-12

For me, I use it as a backup checking account and as such it's rarely needed. But in terms of my experience with the bank, it's been incredible! I have several accounts with them and my online experience with them has been great. Each card/account has very unique features such as an innovative savings system and the ability to transfer money to my account a variety of different ways. And unlike the vast majority of similar offers, the customer service is available 24/7 and you receive help from American, English-speaking representatives. Also, my main AMEX account doesn't have any fees so that's a big plus. I even think their debit cards are very attractive. Due to the fact that AMEX isn't widely accepted as Visa or Mastercard, I rarely use all of these cool features but I always enjoy them when I get the chance.",2018-01-11
2529,Excellent Savings,31020,791,American Express National Bank,46670,5,"I signed up for a high yield savings account a few years ago and I am not disappointed at all. American Express offers one of the highest interest rates and percentages than any other bank I've seen or currently have accounts with. I believe right now the APY and APR are both over 1%. I can take out money from the account very easily and transfer it to my personal bank account when I need to pay off bills or loans. There is a 6 transfer limit per month, but if you think about it, that's a lot of transfers per month anyway. Transferring money from my personal account to my savings account is also really easy - a few clicks and the money is transferred. There are weekends and holidays that they don't transfer so you have to wait til the next business day, but that's not unusual for banks.",2018-01-09

2531,American Express Bank,31011,791,American Express National Bank,46661,3,I decided to bank with American Express after being familiar with their brand. The interest rate I receive is good but not the best. It is a little difficult to get access to my money quickly. A usually brick and mortar bank would allow for quicker movement and transferring. Whenever I call a customer service representative they are very friendly and try to be helpful but sometimes when I need my money to be moved I want it to be done quicker than they can do or are willing to do. That is the biggest pain point for me the fact that everything is digital or connected through a telephone verse being located around me creates a level of problem that I'm annoyed by but willing to give up some of it because of the fact the interest rate is slightly higher than I usually get.,2018-01-09

It upset me to be charged an additional fee amount however I was able to easily contact them and they were able to fix it almost immediately. American Express is one of the leading financial institutions in America and they work well with their customers and clients to ensure they can suit our needs in the correct manner.

They went out of their way to help me, even giving me a credit twice to make sure I was a satisfied customer. I love their mobile app too. It is very user friendly, very quick and easy to use. Their fees are very low. I honestly have not had any reasons to complain about the quality of their services in the four years I have banked with them. Deposits go in quickly and I have never had any issues with missing funds or late deposits to my savings account. I once had an issue where a retailer charged me more than they were supposed to. I contacted the bank and they immediately reversed the charges without giving me a hard time which to me is ideal service quality. The person I spoke to was friendly and polite and really listened to me. It shows a dedicated level of attention I did not get with my other bank which is why I am a loyal customer since.

I was introduced to this platform and account due to having an active credit card account initially. However, once I did my research I knew I needed to continue to use their services.<br/> <br/>First off, this product is a high interest savings account, which are becoming rare and hard to find at the national level. I am currently earning 1.35% APY on my balance - which is unmatched except for very few institutions. I am able to easily transfer money across platforms with great ease, which is awesome. My deposits are incurred automatically through my work and main banking institution, and I am able to see my funds immediately.<br/> <br/>I would recommend this service to anyone. Whether you are saving for a large purchase, stashing away a rainy day fund, or using this to build an emergency fund - this service is top notch.

First, not only is their current interest rate (1.35) excellent--what is more important is that AMEX keeps their rates consistently high; their high yield savings account has not been below .90 in approximately four years. Second, they have very good and professional phone support; there are no account minimums to maintain in order to avoid fees; fourth, one of their best benefits is no ACH limits (many banks have a 5k daily limit for ACH transfers).

Before I was a customer, I never really even considered using them for banking, mostly because I just associated them so much with the American Express credit card, but when I was looking for a new bank, there they were, standing out in several ads online so I decided to give them a shot and I'm happy that I did. I couldn't have asked for more from a bank; my money is safe and every time I've had a question for customer service they've been very helpful and extremely polite and have tried to make sure that my questions were answered in a timely manner as well as a satisfactory manner. The initial question that I had was how long will it take for me to get my permanent debit card? Their reply was 7 business days but I actually got it in 4 days so they were very quick. They really do care about their customers and if I'd known they were a bank with such character and so safe, I would have started using them as my bank long ago.",2017-12-28
2538,American Express not so great,30895,791,American Express National Bank,46434,2,My experience with this bank is as follows. American Express was in my opinion just an average bank. Nothing special about it. No good reward plans with checking/savings account. Also overdraft fees are way too much. They lost my business after I got buried in overdraft fees and they wouldn't work with me. Also I had a hard time getting businesses to accept my American Express card. Some small businesses I went to didn't take American Express at all. I was with that bank for about 2 years until I finally had enough and stopped using them. I believe I still owe them about $100.00 and it has negatively effected my credit. There are times I wished I never had opened an account with American Express.,2017-12-27
2539,Amex bank - savings,30890,791,American Express National Bank,46429,5,"I opened a savings account with American Express about 6 months ago. I opened it because I had opened a credit card through them and saw an advertisement about their savings accounts. I didn't make an initial deposit until about 2 weeks later which was nice, usually banks require one. The interest rate they offer is higher than my bank, and the fact that they don't sent you a linked card or checks for this account make it much easier for me to save. That and the fact that it is separate from my bank account makes it simple for me, deposit a set amount directly out of my paycheck and forget about it. I check on it every once in a while to ensure all is ok but other than that, its just there collecting. I have only had to speak with customer service one time and that was a pleasant experience, the woman helped my change my address in a matter of minutes. no complaints",2017-12-26

Both experiences were really pleasant and not expected from my previous experiences with banks, because I have had some that are very hard to nail down a person to help me out. The issues I experienced were minor snags with being locked out of my account once and a mobile deposit not going through. I got both solutions fixed quickly. It feels very modern and up to date with technology and the changing lifestyle of Americans. The online banking is perfect for me with my schedule and I haven't ran into any problems with it.

2541,Great Experiences with American Express Checking,30875,791,American Express National Bank,46414,3,I opened an account with American Express Banking about a year ago and it was a great decision. We love banking with them! The only downside is the customer service. They're either extremely hard to get a hold of or else not helpful at all. I needed to get in touch regarding an transaction on our account and the wait time was insane. Something like 3 hours. I have two year old twins and I cannot sit on hold for 3 hours to get an answer to a simple question! My house would be destroyed. Other then that though we have had great success with them. We can use the card wherever we go and if we have to use an atm the fees are extremely reasonable. I would recommend to anyone looking for a new bank!,2017-12-24

Their online banking platform works well and I've never really had any issues with it. The mobile app is convenient and easy to use as well.

I have had to deal with their customer service a few times and they have been great every time. They are knowledgeable, the waits are never long, and they have never failed to help me. Which is extremely important since there is no physical branch that I can walk into. Your deposits are FDIC insured just like any other bank so there is no real risk.

It's very disappointing to say the least.<br/> <br/>Their customer service is decent, It would be nice to speak to someone from the states instead of Philippians, or India.

2547,My Experience with American Express Serve.,30569,791,American Express National Bank,45630,4,"I would have to say that my experience with American Express serve was a great experience and was my online banking for over 3 years. What I loved about this is that I had an app that I could just login to and see what my account balance was and also what my transactions were. I loved the feature of the bank that I could reload at any Wal mart and it would be on my card within seconds. This made it easy for when I had paper checks and couldn't get them deposited in the bank. My bank also allowed me to have direct deposit so I was able to have all features of a local bank but all of it was done online. The customer service end of my online bank was amazing. They never gave hard time and really were on top of things. I only had a checking account with them so I could actually take a picture of my checks and things and have it deposited like that. The only thing I didn't like is that when I lost my card I had to have another one issued. This caused me not to be able to access my money for almost 2 weeks, because I couldn't just go inside bank and release money as the banking was online.",2017-11-29
2548,American Express Bank is fantastic,30556,791,American Express National Bank,45617,4,"American Express may very well have the best online savings account one can open. With interest rates nearing 1%, and no fees, it's a no-brainer. Pair this with American Express's legendary customer service, and you have a winning combination. The website is easy to navigate, and allows for up to six transfers from your saving account each month, before a fee is imposed. It is impressive to watch a savings account make more interest in one month than any of my others make in one year.",2017-11-28
2549,American Express has the highest paying Savings and their Transfers are really fast,30519,791,American Express National Bank,45449,5,"I use this checking and savings account with American express because it is quick fo me to acces my money when transferring from one account to another. In most cases, i can send a transfer from the my online payments one Monday, and as ong as it is processed by 2 pm, the it is in my account by the time i wake up in the morning on Tuesday. On top of that, the savings account payments are more than 1%, with all other banks paying about .2%, so even though i d ont have alot in savings right now, it still gets a few dollars each month, and as i save more money, i feel better about depositing it into this account because i know that American Express cares about their customers so they give more back to us.",2017-11-27
2550,Personal Savings with American Express,30482,791,American Express National Bank,45412,4,"I've been a member of this bank for a few years now. I haven't had any problems where I'd need to contact customer service so I can't speak to that. The biggest reason I chose to go with this bank was because of their APY for savings. I have a high yield savings account and the return is fantastic. The website is awesome, I think the best option would be tagging. I love that I can tag transactions to keep notes on specific deposits or withdraws.",2017-11-23
2551,"Great bank for savings, but found better interest rate elsewhere",30424,791,American Express National Bank,45282,5,"I had a savings account with American Express for several years, until I eventually found a higher interest rate elsewhere. Still, during my experience with them, it has been excellent. Online transfers to and from the bank were very easy and quick, and my deposit would often go in the next business day. For someone like me, who watches their budget very tightly, it helps to know how much I will have pending in my savings account. At the time, the interest rates were competitive, and I've never had an issue with them either losing my money or not depositing the interest on time. Customer service was great, as well. No complaints, and would bank with them again (especially because I also hold a credit card from them) in the future, if their HYSA interest rates catch up.",2017-11-20
2552,Great Place for a Savings Account,30323,791,American Express National Bank,44980,5,"AMEX has a great savings account program. Their interest rates are the highest around for savings. When I was shopping around, it was definitely the highest rate that I could find. When I was enrolling in their program, I had to call customer service since I had some questions. They were very informative and helpful during this process. I continue to earn high interest. When I need to transfer money out of my savings, I usually get the money in my checking account the next day. The site says 3-5 business days, but it has never taken more than 2 days to receive the money. I have been very satisfied with this bank. The website is convenient and has never been down when I have needed it. I would highly recommend this bank.",2017-11-13
2553,American Express Personal savings,29983,791,American Express National Bank,44259,5,"American Express Personal savings bank is an online-only institution that has been spectacular for my personal savings goals. With an interest rate of .95%, it blows any offer from a brick-and-mortar bank out of the water. Transfers have always been extremely quick to and from my savings account, generally being received by the next business day. Anytime a problem arises, American Express customer service is there to provide unparalleled quality help, to make sure the problem is dealt with as quickly as possible. As it is a savings account, only six withdrawals per month are allowed from the account, but that helps one meet their personal finance goals by forcing one to keep their hands out of the cookie jar, so to say.",2017-10-20

I have been with them since 2015. Occasionally like today I check other banks to see if my rate could be improved. As you can see there are a few banks with somewhat higher rates, but when I read those reviews I am convinced that it is not worth the hassle. AM EX has extraordinary customer service. So for whatever it is worth, I just wanted to add my voice as a positive review for this bank. I remain very satisfied with my primary bank except as it relates to savings interest, there they are terrible so Am Ex fills the gap for me.",2017-09-20
2555,High Yield Amex Experience,29114,791,American Express National Bank,42224,4,"The high yield online savings account offered by American Express (FSB) offers much higher rates than large brick and mortar banks. The rate I receive now is 1.12%. While nothing to write home about in terms of a rate of return and trying to beat inflation in general terms, this rate beats almost all other savings account rates. There is no minimum balance and the transfers happen pretty quickly and easily. For example, if you need to access your funds, often times the money will appear in your regular checking account the next business day. Finally, Amex is a big, trusty name that isn't going away anytime soon and will not abscond with your money. Highly recommended.",2017-08-25

I get above market rate interest on my deposits, customer service agents are very professional and address issues in timely manner. i love it because it helps me reach my saving goal quickly, as there's no physical location to withdraw money from the account, except via online transfer which take 2 to 3 business days. So what ever money I have in there literally stays in there for good, as opposed to my regular bank account with debit card where am always tempted to swipe my debit card or get money out of the atm.",2017-08-03

If you are looking for an online banking solution that is easy to use and has great costumer service, then I wold recommend them. First of all, it is really easy to deposit to this account. You are able to do things like deposit checks with your phone and pretty much manage the whole account from your phone, which makes it just super convenient to use. Another great thing about their savings account is that they have no minimum amount for the account and that is great because sometimes you need to take money out of your savings account and I like having the flexibility. A another great thing is that they don't have any fees which makes it great because sometimes its just horrible to have to pay fees on everything.",2017-05-25
2558,Excellent savings bank!,27673,791,American Express National Bank,38875,5,"Signing up for American Express Personal Savings (FSB) was one of my best banking decisions ever. I really have no complaints at all. They do their job well. There are many things to love about their service. First, the interest rate is not too bad. It used to be at 1% APY. Dropped to about .9% now but still good. I got to love their fee policy too, because they don't charge any! $0 in fees! I can keep as much or as little in the bank as well without being charged because there's no minimum amount to maintain. Also, customer service is very easy to deal with. I once asked a rep on the phone if it's okay to keep taking out money from the bank. He answered my inquiry very promptly and he was very friendly, too. I have had this account for about five years now and I will keep using it because it's just a great online savings bank in general.",2017-05-03

I wanted a way to be able to withdraw money without it being attached to my main account. Serve gives me the opportunity to either make direct deposits or make deposits at walmart or CVS. I am able to withdrawl my money in over 20,000 atms with very little fees. All contact made with the bank is online through the website or the mobile application. When i have problems with my account is it easy to get help either online or through the phone. I never feel insecure about my personal information because it feels like a very safe process. I can't picture myself working with any other online banking service.",2017-04-20
2560,Experience with an online only savings account,27218,791,American Express National Bank,38015,4,"I opened the American Express savings account approximately 10 years ago. This was the first time I had opened an online only account so I wasn't completely sure if it would fit all my needs, but as it was only a savings account and would not need ATM access, I gave it a try. This was due to the competitive APR interest savings rate it was offering, and the free fee account features. Most of my communications with the bank has been through messages and not the phone, which is an option. It is very easy to set up transfers to and from my external checking account and have had not had any issues thus far and money is deposited at regularly scheduled days. The website isn't completely easy to use as sometimes I forget that my husband does not have access to online statements and 1099 forms because he an not a joint holder, but is an account administrator. This means that I must log in directly to perform any tasks, but as I perform the majority of financial tasks, this isn't a big issue. I have the option of receiving digital statements over paper ones, which I have elected to do. Their rate has gone down over the years, so I am again looking for a competitor that will provide better rates at which point, I may close this account.",2017-03-25
2561,American Express Serve Banking,27056,791,American Express National Bank,37692,3,"I have to say that overall, when you sum it all up, I'm pretty happy with my experience with Serve. I have a checking account that works just as well as if I had a brick and mortar bank. Although I will say I have had a problem using their ""take a photo"" of the check method for depositing checks. When I say problem I mean I've never gotten it to work. So trying to deposit a check into my account is near impossible. I have to cash the check somewhere and then deposit the cash at a store that will load my account, if I want that check in my account. However though, direct deposits and any other deposits seem to transfer and clear into my account sometimes even faster than they would at a brick and mortar bank. Their customer service has been extremely good and quick to get a hold of. And if you want to do savings there are options on the website to set up multiple savings accounts if wanted. I don't get any monthly fees from this bank as long as I do one deposit a month, which I do plenty. And I don't pay fees on ATM withdraws provided I use an ATM in their network. Lucky for me there is an ATM that fits this criteria only one block away. The only real pain I have had to deal with using this account is the fact that the vast majority of small retailers in my area will not take my American Express card. This has become fairly annoying, but now I have just gotten used to going to the ATM everyday to get my deposits out. So even though I have this nice bank account, I find myself going out of the way to turn my card into cash.",2017-03-14
2562,Long-time savings customer,26537,791,American Express National Bank,36290,5,"I use American Express for my savings account. When I first joined, their interest rate was 1%. It's currently .9, but I'm okay with that, too. I've been very, very happy with them. Every time I've had to call, which has only been about 3 times in at least 7 years, I get a person who is not only willing, but able, to help with my request. I have this savings account linked to two different checking accounts, and using AmEx to transfer funds among them is both free, simple, and problem-free. Setting up one-time and recurring transfers is simple, and the service is reliable. The only thing I would mention to customers is if you are planning to link a joint checking account to your savings account, and each member of the joint savings account has his or her own log-in for Amex, link and complete the process (takes only 1 day overnight) for one person and then for the other person (otherwise, you won't know which little deposit AmEx makes should be used to validate for whom). Other than that one little item, every transaction has been absolutely smooth, statements have been accurate, service has been professional, and I have been -- and will continue to be -- a long-time customer!",2017-02-10

I decided to look into the personal banking end of American Express and I'm so glad I did. They have everything my local bank has to offer and more. I first tried a personal checking account and liked it so much I cancelled my local checking account. I have since opened up a personal savings account as well as an IRA,CDs and a college fund for my granddaughter. I couldn't be happier. The rates are extremely competitive and the ease of online banking makes it even better. The customer service I received to help me along with the process has been outstanding.

I needed a simple, reliable checking account that was web-based. I don't need to write a lot of checks. I also wanted to get a checking account that had a reasonable interest rate. This account met my checklist and so I opened an account several months ago. I'm very glad I did. The online tools that this bank provides are simple to use, intuitive, and excellent. The one time I needed to call customer service, I was promptly and cheerfully helped. Plus you've got the peace of mind banking with a well-known company. It really does not get any better than that. This company has exceeded my expectations consistently, and I highly recommend this company and this product.",2016-12-15

I did a big search and eventually settled on this one. It's all been fairly standard so far but for one thing, I have loved my experience with customer service. Any time I need to call for something, I get a real person promptly and they're always happy to work with me and be very flexible about whatever issue I'm having. I also appreciate how fair and reasonable the fees are, much lower than what I see at most other banks. I don't really use very complicated services so I can't speak for their products beyond simple checking, but I like what I see so far.",2016-12-12
2566,Five star rating for AMEX FSB,25789,791,American Express National Bank,34570,5,"Banking with American Express Bank, FSB has been a positive experience. I work in the I.T. industry and have depositing and withdrawing on a daily basis. Each and every transaction has been on time since I have begun banking with them in the earlier part of this year. I am also pleased with the high quality levels of customer services I have received by the AMEX team over the phone. I had questions on several transactions and also about what time the deposits would drop on a daily basis and I received instant answers from the representatives on duty. Overall, I would recommend this bank hands down to anyone with a super busy lifestyle because transactions can be made from the convenience of your own home. I work remotely so the AMEX availability factor works out great for my entire family! In conclusion the rating scale, customer service, mobile app, and fee free banking gets a ten out of ten stars for me on the rating scale!",2016-12-07
2567,MY AMEX BANKING,25786,791,American Express National Bank,34567,5,"I could not be happier with my banking experience at American Express. I did not realize they had so much more to offer than credit cards. I was sent an email asking if I was interested in finding out what American Express has to offer in savings accounts,CDs and IRAs. I looked into it and was very surprised at what they had to offer. Very competitive rates and a large variety of options. I opened a personal savings account and an individual IRA. I couldn't be happier with my decision. I found the customer service to be outstanding and the online banking very convenient. I have looked into changing my personal checking account and have decided to move all of my banking to American Express. I highly recommend American Express for all banking needs.",2016-12-07
2568,Great Option for Savings,25780,791,American Express National Bank,34560,4,"I stumbled across the American Express bank when I was looking for any bank with a savings account with more than 0.1% interest. What's the point of a savings account at that point?! I was happy to find American Express had an online bank with 1% interest (not a lot, but better than anywhere else!). I was a little hesitant to use a bank that was only online, but decided to give it a try. I have to say, it's been very easy to use and I have no regrets. I think what I like the most is the ease of transferring money between different bank accounts. So if I need any of the money I have in the Amex account, it takes less than a minute to transfer it to one of my accounts at a physical bank so I can withdraw it. I also like that I can set up automatic withdraws from one of my other banks. So I can tell it to take a certain amount of money from my other bank every week. It really helps me by forcing me to save money by doing it for me. I've never had any issues so can't attest to their customer service, but if it is anything like the customer service for the Amex credit cards, it's bound to be excellent.",2016-12-06

They have never let me down in spite of difficulties encountered in remote, foreign places or just in my local environment. When I went looking for a savings account there was simply no question about what institution I would choose. Amex is the best. They are as reliable and trustworthy as any financial services company in the world. Their customer service is gold-standard and online access is smooth as silk. Bank-to-bank transfers are quick and effortless. Policies such as access to funds are relaxed and customer-friendly. Their online presence is about as smooth, hassle-free and user-friendly as I have found anywhere. There is no reason to look elsewhere for an online bank. I give Amex 5 stars.",2016-12-06
2570,A great tool to help save,25773,791,American Express National Bank,34553,5,"I started using the American Express Savings account a few years ago and it has helped me automate my savings. One of the best features is the ability to automate bank transfers. Every month, I would have the savings account withdraw a set amount to save each month. I was also able to get a very good rate of return on the savings. As I was able to pay my savings account first in an automated way, I was able to develop a better sense of self-discipline. The user experience is excellent and as such I have never had to access their customer service. All in all I would say this is an excellent choice for any saver.",2016-12-05
2571,Banking online is easy,25768,791,American Express National Bank,34547,4,"I have an American Express credit card. It made sense to me to choose them for my banking needs as well. Opening the account was easy. I like being able to navigate a website easily. I have only had to call customer service once. That was a positive experience. All of my questions were answered, I didn't have to wait on hold for a long time. I like my banking to be accessible and painless. With American Express I get both. I'm happy to have them and will continue to use them for my banking needs in the future. I do have other accounts for checking. I use the American Express account for just a savings account and to manage cd's that I have for my children. I did a bunch of research and I found their interest rate to be higher than I was able to get with my employers' credit union. Every little bit helps when you are saving so this was a plus for me.",2016-12-05
2572,Wonderful Bank,25761,791,American Express National Bank,34539,4,"I first learned of American Express Bank through my credit account. They are an internet bank, rather than a brick and mortar institution. I opened an online high-yield savings account with a great rate to earn on money I need to be able to access and use. There are transaction limits of 6 credits/debits via internet or phone per month so this isn't the type of account to use as a checking account. You link your American Express Bank account easily with other your existing bank accounts so you can transfer money between accounts to use when and where you need it. My online application was simple and it took only a few days to link my existing bank account to use to fund my new account. Even if you're not used to online banks, the savings interest rates are so competitive that it makes it worth opening a new account.",2016-12-02

Their customer service is also easy to reach. The few times I have called, I have reached a representative in less than 2 minutes! No long times keeping a customer on hold, which is great! Their representatives are very knowledgeable and helpful. Also courteous and pleasant to speak with. They will spend enough time making sure I am satisfied with their solution.

2574,One of the best online bankings in USA,25637,791,American Express National Bank,34199,4,"I opened an online savings account with American Express Bank, FSB two years ago. American Express is well known for its credit card, but the banking service is somehow not that popular. One of the main reasons I opened the saving account was due to its high annual interest rate, compared to some other banking options. The process to open an account was fairly smooth - you just need to have the internet access, fill out some basic information, and the account was opened immediately. I used to have a concern whether my money would be secure by using an online banking service which does not offer local offices. My experience in the past two years was extremely positive. For example, the customer service is always friendly. I contacted customer service a few times in the past and they were always helpful. As another example, it is very fast to transfer your money from the saving account to other checking accounts (my personal experience is that money will be available just in 24 hours). This is very important if you want to have access to your money regularly.",2016-11-29
2575,Amex Banking,25605,791,American Express National Bank,34134,3,"American Express has now served as my primary bank account for well over 2 years now. Initially I found it to be the perfect fit for me, but the longer I have the account the more I contemplate changing banks. On the positive side, the online banking experience is nearly flawless. Pretty much anything that can normally be done in reference to banking online can easily be done with my Amex account, and it has been implemented very well. Accessing all the mobile options is very user friendly. Also, since I've had my bank account I have literally not paid one monthly fee. Or really any fee for that matter, sans using any non-associated ATM's. That being said, it can be a pain when you have any minor issue. This is because there is no brick and mortar option to field your issues. Any issue you have with your account must be settled over the phone. I personally do not like this, because a CSR on the phone is way less inclined to handle the situation with a personal feel. The other major issue with the account is the hair pulling debacle I had when trying to verify my account for deposits using the micro-deposit verification method. For some reason Amex just does not support this way of verifcation the majority of the time. I believe it's because other places mistake the account for a credit card because of the name. Either way, despite advertising that it functions just like any other account, it most certainly does not. I also had zero success so far trying to use the mobile check deposit feature. I've tried multiple times with different checks from different places, and it absolutely has never worked. I have tried calling, and the problem is never resolved. This can become a huge problem if you get paid frequently by checks. You don't have a bank to go to to cash it, and their offered method simply does not work. The third huge drawback also to this account is that your debit card is through American Express. Unfortunately I have found that nearly 80% of small businesses DO NOT accept Amex. I have frequently had problems paying for goods because places do not accept my card, which is very frustrating. Overall, I am satisfied with my experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs it as an ""only"" option available. But I personally am ready for a change because of small annoyances that have built up over my time with the company.",2016-11-23

The current percentage is higher than any other local bank I found, so I'm excited to get such a good percentage on my savings. Their website is easy to use and understand.

They are among the top, if not at the top, of savings banks when it comes to providing the APY for your savings. It's always at or close to 1% and even though that's not really much if you don't have thousands saved, it's still something. Customer service has always been great if I have any inquiries about my account. I have never had a bad experience with them. What I also love most about it is that there is no minimum balance required, and there's also no fee to make transfers. You are free to do whatever you want but of course there's a limit to the number of times withdrawals can be made (6 per billing cycle) so it's not the ideal way to pay bills.

One of my big issues was finding a financial institution that would let me have access to my electronic deposits without holding it in processing for days. American Express Bank is able to allow me to have access to my deposits usually within 24 hours of processing which is faster than any of the other banks could offer. I am able to do all my banking online, which is the way I prefer, from all of my devices. The site is very easy to navigate and use, with no down time that I have noticed so far. Finding ATMs that don't charge me a fee has been a bit of a hassle, but it has been that way with every other bank I have ever used. I haven't had any issue as of yet that would cause me to have to use their customer service, so I can not form an opinion as to how American Express Bank fairs on that front, but not having to need customer service in over a year makes me happy.

Their customer service is good in the fact I have never had a wait to speak to someone. They answer right away, which is unheard of in this day and age. The interest paid on my savings is near 1%. This is just about as competitive a rate as you can get on a savings account these days. When you login, I feel the web design could be a touch more detailed. It is a plain landing page - doesn't really stand out design wise. I feel they could put a touch more into the design of their website once you login. Overall they are a decent online bank to work with and I am happy I found their services as a means to save money.",2016-11-08
2581,5-Year Customer - flawless customer service,25349,791,American Express National Bank,33590,5,"I have had my primary savings account with AmEx (American Express Bank, FSB), and they have been just fabulous. Their interest rate has been consistently high -- much higher than regular banks -- and their customer services is top notch. I've had to call them a few times re random issues -- not problems, but questions on how to do things, etc. -- and every time I have reached a person who has been helpful and resolved my problem/answered my question the first time. My savings account is linked to my checking account at my local bank, and I frequently move funds between the two, without charge, using AmEx's transfer option. I have never had a problem. I would highly recommend this bank to anyone seeking a high yield savings account.",2016-10-26
2582,Great Savings Option,25167,791,American Express National Bank,33261,4,"I was frustrated by the savings options lately. You'll be lucky to find a savings account with .02%. The CD options were just as bad. But I found out that American Express actually had an online bank and the basic savings account earned 0.90%. That may not sound like a lot, but it's ten times what I could get at my local bank. The second best part is that there are no fees at all. I don't even need a minimum balance to keep it free. I can also connect it to all of my other banks and transfer money between them for free. So I move money there to save and grow, even a little, interest, and then can just as easily move it right back out if I need it for something. It's been really easy, and free, and a great option for a savings account.",2016-10-10
2583,Amazing Service,25144,791,American Express National Bank,33205,5,"I had been using another bank for my savings for quite some time. However, after receiving an offer about a year ago, I switched to American Express Bank for their more lucrative savings program. My old bank charged crazy monthly fees and I only got a rate of about .02%. With AMEX, I have no monthly fees and my APR is about .9%. Sure it doesn't sound like much, but with my savings amount, it adds up quickly. The best thing was I could move money directly from my checking at my current bank, right into my American Express savings account. Possibly the best feature they have honestly. I've only had to call their customer service once, due to an error processing my transfer request. The customer service was super helpful and ended up getting my transfer done while I was on the phone with them. I would certainly recommend this Savings Account to anyone.",2016-10-07
2584,Happy With This Savings Account,25143,791,American Express National Bank,33204,5,"I opened this account about 3 years ago. I wanted an online account that could pull money out of my checking account each week so I can build up some savings. The set up process was very easy and I was able to be up and running within about 15 minutes. I have never had a problem with this account. The function of the website is great and I can easily transfer funds from one bank to another without any problems. The only drawback is that I wish the interest rate was higher. When the rate is .90 you really have not money gained by saving for it. It really does not give you much advantage to do that. It is something that is like that with every company so they are no different (the rate is actually a little better at AMEX, comparitively). Overall, it is a great product, and you will not run into any problems using it. It also is very easy to access and you can get to your balance very quickly. There is some lag time when you want to transfer or withdraw money, but again, that is the same with all of these kinds of accounts.",2016-10-07
2585,A great online savings account option,25119,791,American Express National Bank,33146,5,"I've had an account with American Express for about 5 years, and have had absolutely no problems with them at all. I've never been charged a fee of any type, despite keeping various levels of savings with them. Their website interface is adequate; the user interface is a bit antiquated looking, but it is entirely functional. Their interest rates are relatively competitive with other savings accounts, which admittedly aren't that high, but par for the course for savings accounts. Contrary to what is often thought, you do not need to be an American Express card holder to open a savings account. I have only needed to contact their customer service department once, but the email communication I received from them was excellent.",2016-10-04
2586,Rock-solid reliable,25101,791,American Express National Bank,33112,4,"I have been a fan of American Express for many years. They have never let me down, and that applies to my online savings account. I wish the interest rate were better, but so does everyone else. The rate on my account is competitive. I have the confidence and assurance in knowing that I can count on Amex to provide the best service in the business. Recently, after somewhat of a lack of activity on my account, I received a friendly, courteous and helpful reminder that I hadn't accessed the account in a while. I responded immediately, got a quick confirmation in return, and once again felt secure and confident about using Amex for my savings.",2016-10-03
2587,Finally a savings account that's worth it,25077,791,American Express National Bank,33045,5,"I was seeking a bank that would actually give me some return on a savings account. Also, I wanted a savings account that was not easily accessible so that I couldn't 'dip' into it easily on a daily basis. American Express Bank gives me this option. I earn 0.85% higher on my savings account than I did at my previous bank. Also, the customer service is superb. They answer quickly and thoroughly.",2016-09-30
2588,Couldn't ask for a better bank,25033,791,American Express National Bank,32978,5,"I have been banking with American Express for over 5 years now. I have never had a problem with this bank in that time. Any question or concern I had about my savings account has been answered promptly. My previous bank had a really bad website which made it difficult to manage my account. American Express' website is nice and easy to navigate to make my information readily available to me. They offer great rates and most fees that they have are very reasonable. Customer Service has only been a hassle once, but my other experiences have been great. I usually get to talk to a representative within 4-5 minutes who is able to help me out. Sometimes I wish there were a bit more product options but overall I can't complain!",2016-09-27
2589,American Express Makes Online Savings Accounts Easy,24980,791,American Express National Bank,32865,4,"With no minimums, no monthly fees, the American Express Savings accounts are easy to open and affordable for anyone wanting to start a savings account. I opened my account with just $100, but you do not need to make a minimum deposit, any amount will do. Also, it is easy to open the account right online and deposit money without having to go into a bank or mail anything. The one question I had that wasn't answered online, was easily answered with a quick phone call and the phone help was everything I would expect from American Express. Overall, a great choice for online banking without having to fork out money for bank fees. I would highly recommend this bank and their online accounts for anyone who doesn't want the hassle of traditional banks and crowds. Their interest rates for savings are just ok, nothing special.",2016-09-22
2590,Personal Saving Account,24966,791,American Express National Bank,32833,5,"I have a personal savings account through American Express Bank, and I love every bit of it. There is actually no on site location. So, everything is done online. The transfer from my outside bank to the savings accounts takes 3 days and the funds show up in about 5 days. It is not a issue for me because I am not looking for the funds to show up quickly because I use it as a savings account. There is also a limit on the amount of withdrawals you can have in a monthly statement. I do all my finances online, so I don't need a local bank. If I need a question answered there is a 1800 I can call and there are representative to help me. I am very happy with American Express Bank, and I recommend this saving account.",2016-09-19
2591,Finally! Savings that accrues interest.,24838,791,American Express National Bank,32517,5,"I started banking with American Express when I was researching potential companies to open a savings account. I was pleased to see the high interest rate that American Express offers as well as no maintenance/monthly/service charges. Upon opening my account, I set up an automatic deposit from my payroll to the account and accidentally transposed numbers on the account number. I had to speak with the customer service department, they were friendly and walked me through what I needed to do and helped ensure my money would not get used by someone else. Luckily, they stagger their account numbers so they aren't close together. I was thankful that they do that because I've heard horror stories about similar situations at other banks. Needless to say, I have been saving to the account and earning interest. A win, win, if you ask me.",2016-09-02
2592,Great For a Secondary/Emergency Savings Account ,24781,791,American Express National Bank,32349,4,"I had been looking for an on-line bank to utilize as a secondary savings account. I have a savings account with my local credit union but wanted another to use as long term emergency fund. Simply by having to login to a separate account, I am forced to think twice before withdrawing any money from this account, so it works perfectly for me. I looked around at a few online banks and settled on AMEX for a few reasons: reputation, no fees, excellent return rate, no minimum account requirement, and ease of use. I was able to set up an automatic transfer from my credit union account into this AMEX account very easily. You are limited to 6 transactions per month, but that's more than enough for my needs. The funds appear as available in the account within 24 hours and start earning interest at a return rate currently at 0.90%. I plan on getting a CD in order to get an even higher return rate. I highly recommend this bank.",2016-08-24
2593,The Best Savings Account,24720,791,American Express National Bank,32204,5,"The savings account is definitely the best that I've ever had. First of all, my most favorite aspect of the savings account is that there are no monthly fees. It has felt very secure and safe when depositing my funds. I also sell jewelry online and would receive deposits from my customers into this account. With the transfers, I would see the money post from 1 to 3 days, usually within a day. Also, with the account not having an ATM or debit card attached to it, it's definitely not as tempting to spend any of this money. Amex is and will always be the best!",2016-08-18
2594,Good Savings Account options,24719,791,American Express National Bank,32203,5,"I have banked with American Express Savings for the past 8 years after I moved to the US. Most banks do not offer good interest rates on savings accounts. I found American Express had higher interest rates, and they were also completely online. I have opened a savings account and several CDs with them. Their customer service is impeccable. Since they are a web-only bank, it is good to have friendly and courteous service at the other end of the phone. Their wait times on phone calls are also low compared to other banks I've worked with. Sometimes it feels odd not to have a physical bank to go to, but the ease of online transactions with them makes it worth it. I highly recommend AMEX to anyone who's looking for an online savings bank option.",2016-08-18
2595,Really Good Institution,24489,791,American Express National Bank,31761,4,"I have really enjoyed having savings with American Express. I was really surprised that I would enjoy banking here, as I thought they were only known for their credit cards. I was able to open my account easily, and when I had a question regarding future savings, and interest rates, I was able to call and get right through. All of my questions were answered in a polite manner that was easy to understand. I am confident with my money being safe, and have really enjoyed the app on my phone as well. I appreciate that there is also no minimum amount required here like some other banks. I get the feel that I am part of an elite group of people, but I am not penalized for living life if I have to take the money out for something. Overall, I would say that the product is excellent, the usability is excellent, and the customer service is top notch. I would recommend them to anyone who is trying to save!",2016-07-26

Their customer service has always been extremely helpful and professional. They actually seem like they know what their doing and are well informed on how the American Express Banking system works. American Express Bank, in my opinion, has always been an institution that cares about their customers. They care about your concerns and your financial future. The tellers are always extremely friendly, and online baking, along with their banking app, is so user friendly (which is good for me because when it comes to technology I'm completely lost). I'v signed up with a few other banks throughout my life, and I can safely say that AMEX has acquired a customer for life in me.",2016-07-25
2597,Easy Savings Account With a Great Rate,24392,791,American Express National Bank,31488,5,"Our family has had an American Express Savings Account for 3 years now and love it. The set up of the account was quick and easy. We were looking for a good interest rate since all the brick and mortar banks around us paid almost nothing (.01%). After doing some research, we choose American Express and set up our account since they offered free transfers and a good interest rate (.90%). I am able to transfer money from our brick and mortar banks checking account directly to our savings account for free, and the money shows up the next day. I am also able to transfer money from the savings account to our checking account, free of charge, and it shows up normally within 2 days. We like having the other options a brick and mortar bank offers (deposit box, notary services, etc.), so AMEX's savings account plus our traditional checking account at our B&M bank makes a perfect pair.",2016-07-14
2598,What All Internet Banks Should Be,24162,791,American Express National Bank,30805,5,"AMEX FSB website is great, very well designed.

Their savings account has one of the highest rates I was able to find. I shopped around a little before opening the account and American Express Bank also seemed to have one of the highest rated savings accounts. I opened the account online, it was extremely easy to do and didn't take long at all. Their online banking is extremely easy to use. I have transferred money between the American Express Bank savings account and my checking account at my other bank multiple times. Since I've had the account, and it never takes more than 2-3 days to show up in either account. I receive my statements online, which is nice because I don't like having to keep paper copies and wasting paper. Their customer service is excellent. When I had difficulty accessing my account, because I was locked out online, I called them and someone in customer service was able to help me get back onto my account with ease. The customer service representative was very pleasant and respectful of me over the phone.

2600,Better than most American Express Bank.,24092,791,American Express National Bank,30724,5,I opened an account with American Express Savings bank over two years ago. I liked them because they had one of the best rates. Better than my other bank of just .10 percent interest. They remain very competitive with other Banks and are currently offering a .90% savings rate on my money. This return is not great but much better than any other bank I have found. There online banking is very easy to access and I would strongly recommend to anyone who is looking to get a better rate on there money. Additionally there are no hidden fees with this bank as well. Which many banks now days try to hide these hidden fees American express bank is up front and honest. If you do not have a savings account I would strongly recommend this bank to anyone. Additionally with their very professional customer service I would recommend transferring my account to American Express bank.,2016-06-09
2601,High Yield Savings,23820,791,American Express National Bank,29995,4,"I opened a high yield savings account with American Express Bank several years ago, and I've been rather happy with the bank. Rates have decreased (considerably) but so have every other bank's, so I can't really hold it against Amex. I've only had to deal with customer service twice over the years, and both times they addressed my problems quickly and appropriately. I had an issue verifying my identity when I first opened the account, and they worked with me to find another way to submit my ID and documents. A year or so later, I was the victim of identity theft when someone stole my credit card number and I had to work with Amex to get my account numbers changed and passwords reset as a precaution. The rep I spoke to was professional and sympathetic, given the situation. The website is well laid out and easy to navigate. They've made a few improvements since I've opened the account, and I really like how easy it is to use the interface and retrieve old statements and tax forms. I liked the savings account enough to open several other accounts with Amex.",2016-05-09
2602,Overall A Good Experince,23758,791,American Express National Bank,29801,4,"Overall I have had a positive experience with American Express, I really like their web/mobile experience but have had some trouble with connecting it to my YNAB account on occasion. The transactions reflect quickly in my account/transaction history. I appreciate that because I can be meticulous with budgeting and tracking my money. I have only had to call customer service once and it was for a pretty basic issue. The issue was cleared up quickly and was everything I have expected. Only reason I haven't given them all 5 stars is because I can't describe it as the ""best bank ever"". There is one other bank, Simple, that takes that top prize. If fees were lower with American Express I think I would change my opinion.",2016-04-28
2603,Solid Savings Account,23751,791,American Express National Bank,29794,4,"I have had an online savings account with American Express for about 2 years now, and in my experience they offer a solid service. The interest rate on your savings is currently .90%, which of course isn't the greatest, but it is definitely better what your standard brick and mortar bank is offering. The bigger drawing card for me though has been the ease of use in depositing and managing the account. Setting up the account was easy, and the customer service has been great. That's what American Express is known for after all. I did have one minor issue where a transfer I made took a little longer than I was expecting, but when I contacted customer service they took care of the issue right away and let me know exactly what was going on. I also love having my savings account and my main credit card account view-able together as well. If you're looking for an online savings account, you really can't go wrong with American Express.",2016-04-26

They have amazing customer service, and offer competitive rates for investment's such as savings accounts. I have been a customer of American Express banking for a few years now and have not had a single problem. American Express has always offered a competitive banking rate for savings accounts and other investment types. I have always had a great experience with customer service, and the one time I actually needed fraud protection for a fraudulent charge they covered me with no exception. I absolutely love American Express banking and will continue to be a customer for them as long as things stay the same.",2016-04-21
2605,Decent Bank,23588,791,American Express National Bank,29343,3,"I started using American Express after my family moved while I was in high school. Before, we used to bank with a small local branch and from what I remember, it was very basic. My parents opened up an account for me at American Express and got me started with depositing money. Once I graduated college, my use of American Express became more important in my life. The transition has been easy as American Express has developed an easy to use banking system for the younger generation. I highly enjoy American Express' online banking feature. It is extremely easy for me to use and I have had no problem checking my account or transferring money. A feature that has been great for me has been the use of notifications. As a student, I do not have a lot of money and am constantly worried about not having enough money in my account to pay bills. American Express sends me notifications to my phone once my account reaches a certain level making it extremely easy for me to keep track of funds.",2016-04-11
2606,American Express Review,23576,791,American Express National Bank,29331,5,"American Express Bank is an online bank that provides competitive rates and products, and is generally better than traditional brick and mortar banks. Because American Express Bank does not have a physical presence, they have a lower overhead than other banks and can pass those savings onto the consumer. As such, their rates for traditional savings are relatively high (0.90% APY last I checked), and what makes this better is there is no minimum requirement. Many other banks require high minimums, sometimes as much as $10,000, to get a preferred rate. American Express Bank also provides competitive rates on CD's, which can range from 0.40% for short-term CDs to 2% for 5-year CD's, also with no minimum requirement. <br/> <br/>The only downside to this internet bank is that it is not as ""accessible"" as a bank from your traditional physical bank. <br/> <br/>One last positive from my experiences with American Express Bank is the customer service. You will not be frustrated dealing with the representatives because they are extremely helpful and knowledgeable and value customer service. You can contact them 24/7 via phone or the online chat, and very rarely do you have to wait longer than a minute before speaking with a live representative. And unlike other banks, you don't have to go through an annoying phone menu before getting to a live person.",2016-04-05
2607,Good Experiences With Amex Bank,23487,791,American Express National Bank,29047,4,"I first opened up an account with American Express Banking in September of 2015. While I have been using an American Express card for a number of years I was a bit hesitant at first to start banking with them, as I wrongly assumed they would be more interested in high rates over customer service. I could not have been more wrong. From the moment I spoke with one of their customer service representatives, Jane, on the phone I was blown away. Jane was friendly, took the time out to listen to my concerns and allayed any fears that I may have had in regards to banking with American Express. Jane explained to me, in no uncertain terms, what the rates for opening a saving account would be, how American Express could help me in any financial situation I may face, and why it was that I should be banking with them. Since that day I have not looked back. I have found their customer service to be increasingly polite and always willing to assist. Their web interface is very easy to navigate and I am able to quickly check my balance, as well as get most information I would need just with the simple click of my mouse. Overall I would say the experience has been great and I would highly recommend to anyone I know that they bank with American Express.",2016-03-23
2608,American Express Bank,23414,791,American Express National Bank,28844,4,"I became a member of American Express Bank back in 2011. I currently hold a savings account with with American Express Bank, and I find it quite useful. The interest rate on this account is currently hovering between 0.90% to 1%; it varies from month to month from what I've noticed. Deposits that I've made to and from this account typically always process within 2 business days. The customer service department at American Express Bank is a bit above average. The one time that I had to use customer service, the department took nearly a half a week to fulfill my request; however, they did keep me updated all along the way. The major downside to this particular division of American Express Bank Bank is that it doesn't offer any other accounts aside from savings accounts. The lack of checking account offers, and even money market accounts keeps me from moving all of my funding over to American Express Bank. Overall, if you're searching for a savings account with a decent return rate, American Express bank is definitely worth a look.",2016-03-16

2610,American Express Savings,23405,791,American Express National Bank,28835,4,"American Express offers a savings account that pays a higher rate of interest than any other savings account I have seen. You get 0.9% interest on your balance. Interest rates are pretty low across the board and while 0.9% may not sound like a lot, it is much higher than what most other banks currently offer. In fact, getting interest at all is becoming somewhat rare. The American Express savings account is simply a savings account. You do not get a debit card or checks with the account and you're limited to 6 transactions a month. I find the account useful given the comparatively high interest offered, but it may not be an account that everyone will find useful. I keep money in the account that I would otherwise have in my checking account - which wouldn't be earning interest. I think it is a good account for people who want to put aside money that they could potentially need and thus don't want to have it invested in the stock market, yet want to earn some return on their money. As always, Amex customer service is top notch.",2016-03-14
2611,Amex Savings a Winner!,23284,791,American Express National Bank,28507,5,"American Express Personal Savings is a great savings option that provides a competitive rate. Not only do they provide good rates of return, but their customer service is top notch. As expected with American Express, their agents are quick to answer questions and do so with a great attitude. I've only experienced positive interactions with them, be it simple password resets to more complex financial inquiries. Their online login system is also super clear, easy-to-use, and mobile optimized. I was always able to check my deposits, withdrawals, and balances on the go and in an easy-to-read display. I appreciated that I could quickly access my information without any hassle. Their website is also great to browse because there isn't any advertising or distracting marketing messages. All the basic information needed was always easy to find and learn more about. I felt very confident that my money was safe and that I would be protected by their great service.",2016-03-01

The pros that I would like to highlight with Amex are their swiftness to deposit pending transactions. I typically receive my direct deposits around midnight with the exception of a recent week where all of my direct deposits hit my account at 11:30 pm on the day the deposit was made. I also am incredibly impressed with the lack of fees. The only time I'm ever charged a fee is when I withdraw money from an ATM. My only issue I have with Amex (which may not even be an issue they can fix) is the lack of companies who accept their card. Over all, banking with American Express is perfect for my lifestyle.",2016-02-23
2613,Average Online Bank,23275,791,American Express National Bank,28498,3,I've had the account for over a year and I don't have any complaints. Its a bank and it does what I want it to do. I haven't had any issues and the rates are competitive. The online website has gotten better since I opened the account which is important to me. The few times I have had to actually talk/chat with customer service have gone well and what I needed was accomplished. I only use this account with money that I make online and spend online so my experience with them is limited. I can't make any predictions on how Amex will work if someone needs more complex banking.,2016-02-23
2614,"Reasonable fees, great customer service and very auto-pilot experience!",23197,791,American Express National Bank,28206,4,"Starting my business with American Express Bank 5 months ago was a final choice when choosing a new bank, and I'm glad I did so. I was very attracted to their APY of 0.90% with personal accounts, way higher with other banks that offer a lot lower, which in my situation, wanting a personal savings account, it meant a lot to me. After signing up and dumping funds into my account, which starting my account and transferring accounts from my previous bank was a breeze. No monthly banking fees at all was a plus for me, I was being charged for silly maintenance fees prior to this bank and they were unnecessary, so that helped a lot. Their customer service is always on point with helping me and they always have a straight forward attitude! A few weeks back, a few checks were not clearing through with my savings account and I called for help, got the help I need, checks were cleared and the system was refreshed and they showed in my account. Very fast service and very positive. Everything else is taken care of for me, which is why I mentioned auto-pilot experience. Their mobile apps are a huge help too, I'm very heavy into my phone and having the app to check balances and check deposits is very handy and it's never laggy or buggy. Overall, my experience with American Express Bank is a very positive one and I wouldn't ever think of going to another bank at the moment, this one met my expectations and more. I would definitely recommend it to other friends and family if they are in the business of switching banks and I'd be glad to help them to set it up!",2016-02-09

They offer great customer service, every question or problem I ever had was resolved fast. Interest rates are at or above average while banking fees are low or non existent. Being an internet bank, they offer a great online experience. Everything works fantastically and is easy to use. And any fee I have encountered was much lower then industry standard or no fee at all. Overall I rank this bank as my favorite and hope they continue great customer service and competitive/low-no fee services!",2016-01-28
2616,Maybe the best personal savings account few know about.,22992,791,American Express National Bank,27535,5,"I have been using the personal savings account from American Express Bank, FSB for about seventeen (17) months now and I must say that I am very impressed with not just the interest rate (which currently at 0.9% APY is one of the best in the country if not the best) but its exceptional customer service seems to be second to none when compared to other traditional banks. American Express as a company seems to have replicated their winning formula for retaining high net worth customers to serving almost about every one with their personal savings account. <br/>The only challenge I have with this account is that they don't give ATM cards and you are only allowed to withdraw funds up to a maximum of six (6) withdrawals per month without incurring any fees. However, if you exceed the maximum six (6) per month, you can begin to incur significant fees per extra withdrawal. This is unfortunate as this can really be a simple fix by American Express which will turn a very good product to a great one.",2016-01-11
2617,An incredible bank,22931,791,American Express National Bank,27321,5,This is the best bank I have ever had. I love pretty much everything about the bank. I really like that I have no fees with the account. Whenever I call I can get a person on the phone. I work odd hours and sometimes I am not home until early morning hours and I can get a hold of a customer service agent even then. There are no minimums on my account and that is another thing that I love. The interest rate on my savings account is a lot higher than on any other savings account I have ever had. Having an account with American Express Bank has also come with great rewards for me. I have received travel rewards from American Express. I have also received gift cards and shopping rewards. I have an account for my business as well as a personal account and I wouldn't change banks for any reason.,2016-01-02
2618,This is a Great Online Bank,22905,791,American Express National Bank,27261,5,"I have been a customer of the American express Bank since 1999, Initially i had just their credit card, aka Blue from American express, but later on when they introduced their savings product I signed for it as well. I opened the persona savings account in 2004 and I have used it more than any other account, the only exception being ING Direct personal Savings now Capital one 360. This savings account has one of the higher yields nationwide and over the years it has not gone below .70 % , i think currently they are giving .90% which is way better than probably 90% of all the savings accounts at other banks. The website you log in to is pretty simple (although the URL is long). Once you login, pretty much everything you need is right there. Earlier there used to be an issue where the addition and deletion of transfer account was not automated and the account owner had to call customer service to make any changes, but that feature has since been added. One of the other best features is a very fast transfer, so for e.g. if you need money from your savings account into checking at some other bank , it only takes as little as 1 day to get it there. Many other institutions take upto 3 days. In the past when I had to call the customer service they were always very courteous and helpful and the speed to answer time was also low. I don't remember calling them twice for the same issue, so they were not only quick but effective . I have not called them in an year but i think the high standards are still there, and this is why I would say this is the best savings account , I still have money in it and probably will keep this relationship for a long time. thanks",2015-12-28
2619,Make it easy,22803,791,American Express National Bank,26960,5,We opened our account with American Express Bank a few years ago. We have had a credit card with them for as long as we could remember and didn't even know they had bank accounts available. One day I was on the phone disputing a charge where a company accidentally charged me twice. The kind gentleman on the line told me about their banking and said I would be eligible for a nice interest rate if I wanted to open up a bank account. After doing a bit more research I found out that they were offering me a lot better deal than my current bank was. I moved some money into the account and haven't had any issues yet. It is very easy to pay off the credit card this way which saves some time. When a lot of your finances are done with the same company it makes things easier.,2015-12-12
2620,Really Great Bank,22771,791,American Express National Bank,26882,4,"This bank is really great. I do most of my banking online through their online banking app and it works really well. I have yet to experience any difficulty with the app loading, with transferring funds, or with depositing checks through the app. I simply love it. The customer service is really good too. I had lost my card once and I called for a replacement and the person I spoke to was very courteous and got everything situated in just a few minutes. I was even able to keep my same PIN, which I was worried about because I'm really quite bad at remembering new PINs. I really like the savings account I got because there are no fees involved with it, which is very hard to find. I tried at multiple banks and every one said that there were fees involved with their savings account and I think it's ridiculous for banks to charge fees to have a savings account.",2015-12-07
2621,American Express Bank,22764,791,American Express National Bank,26876,4,"I've been using an American Express credit card for some time now and decided to try out their online banking system to save money in an account that has higher interest than using my regular savings account attached to my checking account. So far my experiences have been nothing but good. I have had some trouble setting up the account and getting accepted but that was mostly due to factors of the internet application process rather than my own personal qualifications. The customer service is top notch, just like their credit card service. The online navigation is just as easy as any other online banking service. The website is responsive and never hangs up. The APY percentage is way higher compared to your average savings account and there's no monthly fee or any kind of minimum balance required. With those benefits and the fact that you can easily link your other banks with the account to easily transfer money between them makes getting this account a no brainier.",2015-12-04
2622,Great National Bank,22730,791,American Express National Bank,26780,4,"I have used American Expresses online savings accounts for a number of years and have had nothing but great experiences. Yes there are no physical branches but in this day and age that really does not matter. Their great online tools more than make up for the lack of a physical location you can visit. They have a well thought out and powerful mobile apps, that can use your finger print for login at least on iOS. The fees on their deposit accounts are low and interest rate is way more competitive than anything you will find at a brick and mortar bank. Their telephone customer service is absolutely world class after years of refinement from their credit business. If you need a savings account with a great rate and are OK with an online only bank I absolutely cannot recommend American Express enough. It has been nothing but a pleasure using them for the last several years.",2015-11-30
2623,Four Out Of Five Stars,22727,791,American Express National Bank,26777,4,"I have been a customer of American Express savings deposit account customer for some time. I find their website to always be up to date and have current useful features. I like the way the website is designed and the fact that it really seems like the company has a genuine interest in providing customers with the most current banking options. The only issue I have with them is their customer service. I do not feel that the agents are trained as well as they would have you believe and I think a few more training classes would likely go a long way. I do appreciate the fact that they are available 24 hours a day as this is not the case with most banks. The agents do seem to be very concerned with my happiness as a customer, they just do not always have the answers I am looking for. Overall I like banking with American Express and have no intentions of closing my account in the future.",2015-11-30
2624,The Best Bank!,22582,791,American Express National Bank,26362,5,"A few months ago I opened a high yield savings account with American Express Bank. I opened it because I have another banking product with them and needed to put my money with a bank I could really trust. The experience with American Express bank has been great! With that being said I believe every institution have their problems, but I expect issues to be handled in a timely fashion. After opening the account there was an issue I had with a transfer not showing up in my account. The funds had already been taken from my other account which is at another institution. Of course I put a phone call in and with them and I immediately got someone on the line. The realized how important this was to me, as it would be with any customer. While on the phone they figured out what the issue was and made sure the money was credited to my account immediately. That really made me feel safe about depositing my money with them, especially since I cannot walk right into a branch! I appreciate their great customer service and their since of urgency! THIS IS THE BEST BANK!",2015-11-02
2625,Fast Survivorship Account,22469,791,American Express National Bank,26030,5,"I opened my high yield account, a 60 month cd, for my teenage son. My child has Autism, and I wanted to assure he will have something if I pass away that would be fast to access. There are zero fees, so I made it a joint account with survivor-ship so other family could make deposits to it and he would be able to access it swiftly. As my son is a duel citizen, I wanted to make sure he could access the money internationally in Ireland as well, and American Express is by far the best option. With this he can make up to 6 withdrawals a year with no penalty and the yield is much better than the competition. There is no minimum balance either, so you can open it with literally $1 dollar, and set up funds transfer from your bank for auto deposits as often as you want. The also have very well trained 24/7 online and phone support. I have only good things to say about American Express Bank and their high-yield CDs.",2015-10-16

I love the way my direct deposit shows up on my account 2 days prior to day it is scheduled to show! I used this card to do a lot of paypal prepayment agreements and often times, I would forget I authorized a merchant to deduct funds from my account for their product or services, American Express is GREAT because before paying it, they would issue me an alert via email AND text to ensure I have agreed to this prepayment prior to disbursing my funds. If I ever incur a problem or have questions about a transaction, When I call in, I am helped IMMEDIATELY with no long hold times.",2015-10-15
2627,Adequate Experience,22465,791,American Express National Bank,26026,4,"I have been with American Express Bank for almost two years now and I don't really have any complaints. I was with SCBT for about four years prior. I'd say the two banks have a lot in common as far as my account goes. A.E. doesn't charge me to have an account and there is no minimum requirement for how much is in my account. I had to have a hundred to put in, I think, but overall I like that I don't have extraordinary fees like I've seen with other banks. As far as their customer service is concerned, I've never had any serious problems. Their attitudes are usually friendly and try to be helpful. I had a security breach on my card and I think they handled it fairly well. They knew about it and corrected the problem before any further damage could be done, within two hours of the breach and contacted me to let me know what the solution was.",2015-10-15
2628,Decent Banking Experience,22443,791,American Express National Bank,25961,4,"I have banked with American Express Bank for several years now. What brought me to them was the convenience. I've recently changed most of my banking over to AEB exclusively because of the service that I have received. I very much appreciate their mobile app that allows me to very quickly locate ATMs that won't charge me absurd fees, allows me to quickly check my balance, allows me to deposit checks via mobile, etc. I recently had an issue with a transaction that came across my account and was impressed at how quickly the customer service reps took care of the issue and made me feel safe that the situation would not happen again. I have only had one incident that angered me in the several years that I have banked with AEB. This last spring, I used my card for a very large purchase in a town about an hour and a half away from me. When I returned home, my card was denied for a small purchase. I thought their system was down, so paid cash and left. I attempted to use my card a few minutes later for another small purchase, only for it to be denied again. I immediately called AEB to find out what the problem was. They informed me that the very large purchase in a different town flagged my account for possible fraud. I was very angry with them for the declines, until I understood why they did it. I answered a few quick questions and they unflagged my card. My only other complaint about AEB is the fact that it is a bit frustrating, when I have a question, that I can't speak to someone who speaks clear English. It's that way with so many companies anymore, and it's very frustrating. Overall, I don't have any major complaints. I really rather enjoy the card and it's convenience and ease of use.",2015-10-13
2629,American Express Bank Savings Account,22406,791,American Express National Bank,25864,5,"I currently hold an American Express Personal Savings account. Opening this savings account was incredibly simple, and only required $1 to open. I've only had to make use of American Express's customer service for this account once, and that was when I forgot my password. The process of recovery was incredibly simple and quick. The interest rate on this savings account is above average. The interest rate was at %0.80 percent at the time that I opened the account, though it did drop slightly to %0.70 about 2 months after my sign up. The interest rate on the American Express is currently holding strong at %0.90 percent. I currently have this savings account linked to my checking account at a different bank. The transfer time between these 2 accounts, on average, depends largely on where the transfer is initiated. Any transfer that I make which is initiated from the American Express savings account takes 5-6 days on average to complete. While a transfer from my outside checking account is completed in 3 days. Overall, the American Express Savings account is a solid choice if you're looking to build up a rainy day fun, or just to save period.",2015-10-07

2631,American Awesome,22153,791,American Express National Bank,25005,4,"I recently chose to open a savings account with American Express, as I was forced to make a change in banks due to a cross-country move and I wanted to have my money closer than 2,000 miles away. Being a student who works for meager wages and who has very little free time, the ability to deposit my paychecks without having to make a trip to the bank itself is invaluable. The local staff in my new town are very approachable and courteous - I normally am nervous when dealing with placid bankers, but the staff at my most frequented branch are engaging and I find myself smiling with them when I interact with them. I do not plan on getting a credit card with this bank, though, due to their tremendously high interest rates. Overall, I am pleased with this bank and will stick with them in the case of a future move, as they are ubiquitous across the US.",2015-08-28
2632,Straight-Forward High Yield Savings,22098,791,American Express National Bank,24912,4,"I've had a high yield savings account from Amex for the past several years. The only time I've dealt with the customer service was when I was setting up the account & had some technical issues with the website. The customer service reps I dealt with were helpful and easy to understand, but I did get transferred several times before I found someone that could help. The savings account itself is exactly what I wanted - minimal fees, decent interest rates in comparison to other banks and an option to be completely paperless. I really like the layout of the website; it's changed since I first opened my account and it is much easier to navigate now. With the new layout, I can set up a transfer into my savings account in just a few seconds. The recurring transfer option has been great for keeping me on top of saving as much as I should be and it's really easy to change when I need to. Overall, it's an account I never have to think about to much, which is ideal for me.",2015-08-17
2633,Great savings bank!,21960,791,American Express National Bank,24661,5,"I remember when I was in the process of looking for a nice savings bank with a great annual percentage yield. I did my research, and found out about American Express Bank at the time. It had 1% APY, and still remains close to that up to this day. I was unsure of how to get things started, so I called the customer service number on the website to find out more about how beneficial it would be to sign up for an account. Well, for one, there's no minimum balance that you have to maintain. You can take out as much as you want without worrying about any penalty, said the rep. Being honest, he also reminded me that the APY tends to fluctuate, but not far off from 1%. Customer service was excellent, I thought to myself. As I signed up and used it myself, I found it easy to check balances, make bank account transfers, and keep track of monthly interest. It's not much when it comes to the yield, but hey, this was one of the best out there at the time when it comes to APY, and it still has one of the best to this day. It's been almost four years since I signed up and have gained hundreds already from interest savings. All thanks to one of the best out there, the American Express Bank.",2015-08-01

They have always had great customer service and help me with any situation that may have come along. Due to me opening my account a while back, I was allowed to keep my rate for my saving accounts which was great. They really want to satisfy their customers and that's how they make you feel. I would recommend American Express to those that like to save but want to have a bank that is based online.",2015-07-24

In general, I found the website easy to navigate, it was easy to make deposits and withdrawals to and from my account, and I had no problem getting in touch with a customer service rep over the phone when necessary. My only disappointment was how difficult it was to have my name changed on my account after I got married. I'd been going through the same process with many other entities at the time but I found Amex to be one of the most difficult as far as requirements go, ease of submission of forms and paperwork, the need for originals versus copies. It was a headache and ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth that was the catalyst for closing my account at a later time.",2015-07-23
2636,"American Express Savings was competitive, but just didn't work for us.",21859,791,American Express National Bank,24455,3,"My husband and I decided we would switch from the typical branch savings account to an online bank, as interest rates were (and frankly still are) at an all time low. We wanted to earn as much money as possible for whatever cash we had. At the time, American Express was offering the most competitive rate for their savings account and we signed up. I will give credit where credit is due and state that their customer service was top-notch. In dealing with various situations on the phone with their agents, they were thorough, considerate and unified in providing accurate information and resolving any issues. Also, we were quite impressed with their mobile app and website. Easy to use and always accessible. What didn't work for us was not having a checking account through American Express. Transferring to and from their savings account to our bank took some time to process -- and we just needed to be able to access our money immediately. For some people (I guess people who have more money in their checking account at any given time) this may not be an issue, but for us it was. We decided to switch to a different online bank that offered comprehensive services that would meet all of our needs. Again, our experience with American Express was positive, it just wasn't the right fit for our family.",2015-07-20

I was initially afraid of selecting the Amex brand in that I thought it would be 'too expensive' or cater to much higher net worth individuals. This was not the case. The fee structure and associated rules that Amex high yield savings provides me is perfect. Not that it is a problem very often, but NO minimums allows me to stay very flexible from a cash flow standpoint. I wanted a bank that WAS NOT associated with the bailouts when I was affected, and my choice was excellent. I've NEVER had issues accessing my money and I never have to worry about mergers/acq's/etc. Even though my account balances run $8,000-$12,000, I feel like I am treated as equally as a high net worth individual with 7-figure balances. I thought not having a 'brick and mortar' branch to walk into every week would be an issue, and it has not been at all.",2015-07-16

When I opened an account with them, I was concerned how the online aspect of the account would work, but it has exceeded my expectations. Electronic transfers move quickly without annoying or confusing delays, and I can always access my account information online when I need it. The website has never given me trouble, the security on my account is excellent, and I have never had to go sort out issues inside a physical bank branch.<br/> <br/>I have rarely had problems, but the few times I have - for example, once I was having an issue accessing my account on mobile - I called customer service and got an immediate answer. The receptionist on the other end didn't give me a runaround or patronize me. She asked how she coudl help me, I described my problem having trouble accessing my account, and she put me through immediately to the representative who could help me. That person was polite and welcoming, but also efficient and able to solve my problem with no hassle. All I had to do was approve a certain security feature that was a measure to ensure someone else couldn't steal my phone and my account.<br/> <br/>My experience with my account gave me so much confidence that I opened another savings account as well and have had nothing but good experiences with it. The fees associated with my accounts are very reasonable - lower than I had heard they would be and lower than many other online banks.

They have always been superb in that regard, so I while searching for a savings account, I figured why not give them a shot? What harm could it do? They been awesome! Their rate is currently at .9% which is not the highest out there for an online savings account, but it's still competitive and you get added benefits for taking the minor hit to the rate by going with American Express. Their deposit hold times are what one might expect from an online bank but they're customer service is phenomenal as always and you get a slew of other benefits as well. Whenever I have a problem or a question their live chat makes me feel as if my issue is important which is something I had issues with at other banks in the past. Their mobile app is definitely one of the better banking apps out there and their website is pretty top notch when it comes to online banks. There's no fees or minimum account balances required which is pretty important to me. I use them to stash my emergency fund just in case I should lose my job or have an accident of some sort. It's nice having peace of mind that if I ever need to tap into that money the bank won't hammer me with fees if I can't replace it fast enough. Overall I love American Express and would happily consider them for CD's and other banking products from them in the future. They continue to be one of the better banks to work with.",2015-07-07

She told me the bank had a good reputation in customer service, mobile and online banking services, and an overall smooth banking experience. I had a Bank of America account and was reluctant at first to open an account in another bank. I figured it wouldn't hurt to try American Express Bank and I'm glad I did.<br/> <br/>At the time I started using American Express Bank, I was a college student and they offered me 100% free checking and savings accounts. They assisted me in the account opening process and the overall experience was good. Now it's two years later and I still enjoy the services the bank offers for free. Whenever I need to contact customer care, they listen to my needs and assist me as well and as promptly as they can.<br/> <br/>The bank is also very good when it comes to online and mobile banking services.

Luckily, I can count American Express into the good category. Their rates for savings accounts are very enticing and competitive, especially right now at 0.90%; the interest is really accumulating for me! The online experience is very nice as well. The website is very well designed, being both physically attractive and easy to understand. I do think that customer service is their weak spot (when I first signed up and had trouble with my account, the customer service team was very little help to me, making me wait for hours on end just to get an answer on a question), so be aware of that. However, that was only one time and this happened a year ago, so it's possible that things have improved since then. I should also add that the fees are pretty reasonable overall, especially compared to other banks out there. In summary, you'll have a hard time finding much better on the market. I definitely recommend American Express!",2015-07-03

As for customer service, American Express has had the reputation of excellent service toward the customers. The times I have had to personally deal with them they were accommodating and easy to work with and took the time to make sure they I was satisfied. Overall I am happy with my account through American Express Bank and though you are not going to retire anytime soon if all you have is a high yield saving account it is still loads better than some of the other competitors that only give you 0.03% interest.

Transfers go through quickly, and it is easy to open and maintain multiple accounts to track savings for different purposes. There is no mobile app, which is kind of a drag, but it is easy enough to just log in on the web and do what I need. There is no fee to open or maintain an account, and transfers are limited to six per month. I have never really had to deal with customer service, so I don't really have an opinion as far as that is concerned.

As of this moment, I have an account with American Express, EmigrantDirect and SmartyPig. Both American Express FSB and SmartyPig take 2 days to transfer money to and from my bank (not counting weekends). If you want fast and predictable access to your savings then this is certainly not the bank or account for you. That said, you simply will not find a better rate. They pay interest on schedule and as promised. The rate does not appear to be a teaser rate either. Although in the grand scheme of things .9% for interest is not a lot, it is the best rate you will find right now.

My savings account with American Express, FSB has been opened for nearly 8 years and in that time I have found their customer service to be absolutely superb (they actually take the time to answer all your questions and help you with any concerns!) and am happy with my ability to link my savings account to other checking accounts (if only AMEX, FSB offered checking accounts too!!) I have never had problems with ""overdraft"" fees and have never feared taking out ""too much"" money from my savings account because my account has no minimum (which is extremely helpful in times of emergency). Seriously, would recommend American Express, FSB to anyone!",2015-06-25
2646,"American Express has well trained, compassionate customer service people.",21609,791,American Express National Bank,24002,5,"I opened up a personal savings account at American Express because I wanted to start putting money aside for a vacation for me and my daughters. I felt that my money would be safe with American Express and it has been of course. I had an issue recently where I had to contact American Express because I really messed up and transferred too much money from an external checking account into my American Express savings account. I was in a total panic because I was going to have checks bouncing from my external error due to my mistake. I contacted customer service, and expected to hear that I was just going to have to deal with it, but the absolute total opposite was true. The customer service agent understood, and I mean she really understood, that I was in a panic. The first thing she told me was not to worry, she would do everything she could to help me and she would stay on the phone with me even if she had to get other people involved. I felt so much better even just hearing that. She managed to get the right departments involved and got my deposit cancelled before it went through, and I did not have to deal with an issue with my external account. And she really had to work hard at getting that done, contacting several other departments and a supervisor in order to confirm everything would be done correctly. I appreciate her so much and how American Express must train their customer service people on handling ""panicked"" customers like I was. You don't see customer service like that anymore. I will be staying with American Express just for that fact alone.",2015-06-23
2647,A fine bank for a savings account,21455,791,American Express National Bank,23786,4,"I opened a high yield savings account with American Express Bank over a year ago. So far I have few complaints. I have never had a problem depositing or withdrawing funds, and as of yet I have not had to deal with customer service. Online banking with this account has been a breeze. I travel frequently for work, and I have had no problems managing this account on my computer. I particularly like that the account comes with no fees or minimums, more than once I have need to transfer money and the lack of a mandatory minimum balance has been helpful. Having said all this I also don't feel like this particular account is outstanding or better than other accounts I have. All in all I would call this an average savings account from an average bank, but still a good option for someone looking to open a new account.",2015-06-10

I had been contemplating a separate savings account for some time. I decided to apply and give it a try as Christmas savings money. Opening the account was a cinch. I did it all online via electronic transfer. It has worked out very well. Turns out its a high yield savings account so I earn interest. There was no minimum balance needed to open or maintain the account, and no ongoing fees. Anytime I've had to transact with customer service, it has always been a pleasant experience. One note is there are no branches near me but I do have an ATM card, and it actually feels a little prestigious carrying the Amex name. I rarely need to conduct in person transactions and prefer the app anyway, so it works out fine.",2015-06-01

AmEx Bank was one of two banks that required that I resubmit a new signature card for the new account considering they already had my signature on file from the joint account, but unlike the other bank I was unable to complete the process online. Instead you have to wait until AmEx mails you the form so that you can fill it out and mail it back to them.<br/><br/>Also, ALL of my my other banks allowed me to change the beneficiary on my accounts quickly and easily online. AmEx Bank was the exception. To add a beneficiary with AmEx required that you print out a form, fill it out and mail it in.<br/><br/>Customer Service was not helpful when I asked why I could not complete those tasks online or why I could not simply print the needed forms, fill them out, scan them and email them back.",2015-05-28

It allowed setting up automatic withdrawals and deposits which is very useful if you are trying to save money. It did take 6 days to transfer any of the money in or out but that also helped save money as it is not as easy to access, and thus it was much easier to not spend money on impulse.",2015-05-25

They have very competitive rates - one can easily tell by doing a Google search on the best savings rates from banks that are currently offered. In addition, their website was easy to navigate and understand. I could quickly see my balances and take actions on my accounts without worry of fluff or marketing getting in the way. Their website was very clean and I appreciated that their customer experience across registration to continual has been only smooth. Even when I forgot my password and log in information, I called customer service who was able to quickly help me regain access. I trust them more because of the American Express brand and have only great things to say about their service - highly recommended!

Their customer service department is very professional. They go above and beyond their job requirements, to make sure that your needs and concerns are met. I have in the past had a couple discrepancies that I came across while reviewing my statement online. They were more than willing to help resolve the matter. I like how they notify you if they happen to come across unusual activity on your account ( activity out of the norm). I also enjoy not having to pay a fee every month to maintain my bank account as well. The only thing that I don't like are the ATM fees. The charge for using certain ones can add up very quickly. You get charged the bank's fee, plus the fee at the ATM you are using. All in all, this has been the best bank I have conducted business with hands down. I've tried Wells Fargo, SunTrust and Bank of America ,and none can compare to American Express.",2015-05-21
2654,Thank you for helping me save my money and time,21213,791,American Express National Bank,23415,4,"I would like to thank the customer service team at American Express Bank. For years I held an Express credit card but, unfortunately I was finding fewer and fewer places that accepted the card. It wasn't a hard decision to start an additional savings account with the company that I had trusted my finances with for so many years. The team was so helpful in finding the appropriate ways to distribute my funds into both CD's and a savings account that had a high interest rate. What I really love is the online and mobile access of being able to ask questions and not being put on hold over the phone like at other banks. The ease of being able to Tweet questions is great and I can wait for a response while doing other things. But their customer service team is helpful all the time. For instance, last week I had an issue with a transfer that had not processed in the normal time frame, or so I thought. I received a phone call prior to me investigating the problem by American Express letting me know that some withdraws were made that didn't fit my normal patterns. After speaking with the rep, it turned out that my account number had been mistaken for someone that was planning a wedding. They froze my account within minutes and by the end of the day I had all my current funds transferred into another account so that I had access but the others did not. The money that had been taken out of my account was replaced within 3 days. It was a great experience and a fast turnaround time so that I was able to access my savings without penalty for the mistake.",2015-05-17

When I arrived at that bank I didn't like the service and I start to go online to see what other banks were there to hold my money and I came to American express. Now this bank is one of the best because of the customer service experience I had. this lady showed me how much benefits I would get with american express. I loved their checking account because I don't have to worry about fees or min on their accounts. I love that they are accepted worldwide and don't have to worry about getting my card blocked because I can call their international phone number and get it touch with someone on the spot. I love their debit card because when I went to the bank they told me that I would get my card in two weeks and when I got it I got an alert to activate it on the spot. I love how it gives me a lot of alerts to make my banking very easy.,2015-05-17

It was very easy to follow the steps needed to speak to customer service through their telephone number. I was able to speak to a representative quickly and they helped me to better understand the transaction on my account. I was pleased that it was so easy to speak to someone in a time of need. There are little to no fees associated to banking with American Express. I have stayed with American Express for so long because of their polite customer service and easy online banking.

About two months ago I had an issue logging into my account, so I called and they took care of it right there and then. I didn't get pushed from one person to the next, the first person I talked to was the one who fixed my account. I also didn't have to wait very long to talk to someone like you do with most banks. As much as I love their customer service the best thing about the bank is that they don't charge a monthly fee when most do. They also don't require you to have a minimum balance, which is great.

Recently, I was traveling abroad and used my ATM card at a foreign bank and when I checked my statement there were all kinds of fees. I knew to expect some fee's but these were ridiculous. I contacted the bank and asked them what the deal was and they said the foreign bank charged many different fees, they only charged one. I complained that I was getting charged way to much money and they were kind enough to reimburse me for some of the fees. They said it was only a one time thing and next time I would be charged the full amount but I thought that was very fair, and in the future I knew to check with each bank before withdrawing to know what the fees were ahead of time. The customer service was outstanding, fast, and very professional. Outside of that one incident I have never had any need to contact them, and no problems to report.

Until this day, the funds are not available if I wished to use the money, and it is now the 16th. <br/> <br/>I have become disgusted with banks who like to hold onto consumers money with the claims that they are verifying the funds transfer, etc., but the funds were out/cleared/deducted from the funding account as of the 31st. So, I am not sure what they mean by verifying and they told me 5 business days from the transaction date and still not cleared. <br/> <br/>Otherwise, I have not had a service issue and the product is very competitive, but banks in general love to hold onto consumers money for as long as they can and wherever opportunities to do so present themselves. <br/> <br/>I would still recommend the tool/product for saving. <br/> <br/>Good luck!",2015-03-16
2662,One of the Best Online Savings Bank in the US,20459,791,American Express National Bank,22320,5,"American Express Personal Savings Account is one of the best in the business. It features a very high interest rate (specifically .90% per annum) in any amount you're going to save to the bank. Not to mention that it's compounded daily. The bank does not offer a debit card or checking account. This, in my opinion, helps me save money. Furthermore, since it's online, there are less hassles like fees and long queues. Withdrawal and deposit transfers are within a day, except for weekends. However, I have not yet experienced calling the customer service, but I heard that they handle their customers really well. Further, I have not yet contacted the CS since there are technically no problems whatsoever with my experience with this wonderful bank. In line with their efforts to make their customer service better, they created a mobile app for banking. The Amex Mobile application looks sleek and modern in iOS. It alerts you when your account is being used. As an online bank, the web experience is really hassle-free and simple. <br/> <br/>Overall, their service is very commendable and one of the best, if not the best, in the (online banking) business.",2015-03-06
2663,Amex Is The Best,20453,791,American Express National Bank,22314,5,I have always had a positive experience with American Express Bank. One of my most favorite things is that there are zero monthly fees. The fact that there is no minimum balance is also really helpful because I do not have to worry about have a certain amount of money in the account. My interactions using their online site have been very smooth. I have never had an issue using their website. On some rare events that I have had to speak to customer service via the site they have always responded in a timely manner. On times that I have spoken to customer service over the phone they have always been very professional in handling my situation. I also hold an American Express credit card. The particular card that I have does not have a monthly fee either. The quality of service that I receive for both my account and credit card have always been superior than the service that I receive from other banks or financial institutions.,2015-03-05

It has competitive rate. Anyone who are interested in savings account should look into their product. The money is going to be safe there since American Express has very good reputation. Saving accounts at American Express, like those offered by other financial institutions, have low rates due to the type of investment but they are safe. You cannot lose money. Savings accounts are good for people who are very conservative like myself. I would suggest the savings accounts and CDs that are being offered by American Express.

Soon after they reduced the rate, not once but twice in just a few short months. Now their rate isn't the highest on the market anymore, but I don't think I'll switch banks. I like their online banking site which is very easy to use. It's also very easy to link my other bank accounts to the new account so that I can transfer funds. There's no monthly fee associated with the account and there's no required minimum balance. I didn't experience any problems since I opened the account. I routinely transfer funds in and out of the account and every transaction has been processed accurately and quickly. I'm giving them 4 stars for competitive products because they reduced the interest rate twice in the last couple of months. I'm very happy with the bank otherwise.",2015-02-15

As a member of American express card services I thought getting a savings account would work out well. So far the interest rate has fluctuated quite a bit since opening the account and it is now significantly lower than the amount I originally signed up with. When I try to reach customer service it is challenge because they seldom seem to have the correct information on file when you speak over the phone. I had to be transferred to several reps who all verified the same account information just to answer a simple question about deposits via check and they occasionally will return a check if it does not meet their requirements.

Despite a slight initial, yet understandable, issue with verifying my identity to setup my account, I haven't had any problems. <br/> <br/>I love this account because there are no fees, I'm not required to carry a minimum balance, they don't send me a bunch of spam, transfers are very fast (two business days max), and best of all, the interest rate is 0.90%. <br/> <br/>There aren't many bells and whistles to this account, it is very simple. The only things you can do online is update your profile information, view your transaction history, manage your alerts, and make transfers. I like it like that. it's very straight forward and easy to navigate. <br/> <br/>Besides to help verify my identity when I first opened the account, I haven't needed to contact customer service, and the representative I spoke with was friendly and quickly solved my problem. <br/> <br/>Another cool thing is that they don't retrieve their test deposits when you link an external bank account. They send two deposits that are close to $1 each! Hey, I'll take anything I can get. <br/> <br/>I've got my girlfriend to open an account, and I'll recommend this account to anyone.",2015-02-09

About two to three years ago, I was looking for a savings account that topped the competition in terms of APR. At the time, AMEX was at 1.00%. It a little higher than most savings accounts I browsed. I set one up and loved getting monthly interest back. Yet, it seemed like the more I added, the lower the APR became. In the end I think it went down to as much as 0.75%. I don't know whose fault it is (market or AMEX?), but what I know is that the website and how it's set up is just fantastically convenient, even an ""old dog"" can use it easily. Now, the rate has gone back up some. The options are easily accessible. I opened my account within 12 minutes, I found several facts about the account really quickly (e.g. no fees and minimum balance!!!), and easily learned how I can make transfers to and from my separate checking account. Statements and help options can also be accessed very easily. The website itself is not intimidating and very user-friendly. I called up customer service too to find out if I can have a joint account set up and he fluidly led me through the process.

The programs American Express offer are great, too! Low fees, wonderful service, fast service, accurate details in online banking. Those are just a few of the great qualities of American Express Bank! I really enjoy the online banking, too! It's so easy just to log in to my account and check my balance of not only my checking account, but also my savings account, too. I also can view my statements online. The online banking is not confusing and very easy to understand and follow. I also love the rewards you receive from American Express for just banking with them.

This bank also has great customer service. I had a few questions while setting up my account, so I called the customer service line and was helped by a friendly young woman who seemed very eager to make sure all my concerns were addressed. My first question was to find out whether or not there were any fees associated with the high yield savings account. I wanted to make sure that I was clear on all of the restrictions and requirements to avoid any unanticipated fees. The woman who walked me through the list of possible fees was very patient and clarified the majority of my concerns. I also wanted to know if the annual percentage rate on the high yield savings account would change because I have had accounts in the past where the rate would decrease without letting me know.

The money I was making in my saving account compared to most banks/my personal bank saving account interest, was crazy high. Opening an American Express saving account was easy, and I did not have any troubles doing it. I have been referred by friends who also have saving accounts with American Express and we all, have no regrets in doing so.

They have been thus far the most fair and upfront bank I have ever had to deal with. Other competitors have hidden fees or practices that where they introduce a fee to your account without contact or notification. On the flip side, you have Amex, who gives you all there terms right up front, then sticks to them. In addition they have extremely user friendly apps, mobile, and or web interfaces. This provides overall the most optimal experience for me as to the fact that I do not have time for phone calls and or personal visits to banks. The one downside that I have experienced with Amex is that I have opted out of email offers and or special promotions and still receive them. My inbox is not blowing up and it is not excessive, however I did opt out and have still received communications. Aside from this, all expectations have been met especially when it comes to the financial sector of the agreement.",2015-01-22

We currently use the American Express credit card for our small business and trust the American Express name. We have always had great experiences with their customer service department for both our credit account and online savings. Since we are only using the savings feature, being an online only acct and not have a brick and mortar building did not bother us. We easily make transfers from our checking account at another large institution, straight into our savings account. The interest earned is fair in today's economy. Opening the account was a very smooth 15 minute process that we were also able to complete online. There are no monthly fees on our account and no minimum balance to maintain.

Fast forward today, and I currently hold the bulk of my savings in American Express bank. I've only ever used the banks customer service once when I forgot my password. It was quickly reset, and I was good to go. One thing about American Express bank that I'm not entirely too pleased about are their interest rates. When I opened the account back in 2010, the interest rate on the savings account was hovering above 1%; the interest rate dropped to .80% and is now at .90%.

However, I recently decided to give them a try and I have been pleasantly surprised. American Express offers a wide variety of account options, though the two big ones are the Savings accounts and the CDs. They actually give a good interest rate on the savings account, 0.90% or so. It's still less than what Discover offers, but compared to a lot of other banks, it's a good deal. The customer service has been a bit iffy, I do admit; I haven't really needed it much, but whenever I've called they've been slow and unresponsive. The website interface works well, though; it's easy to understand, simple to navigate, and has yet to give me any trouble. I haven't even had to worry about the fees, so that should tell you that they're no big worry. Overall, American Express is a solid option, and if you've got some cash you'd like to tuck away into a savings account, it should definitely be on your shortlist.",2015-01-20

I was always getting fees for the most ridiculous things. I made the switch when I was talking with a friend and she suggested American Express. I joined and I haven't looked back in 5 years. I have not accumulated one fee. Not one. I have a good selection of free Atm's which for me is a huge plus. I hadn't had to deal with customer service very much excepts once when my card was stolen. They were prompt in replacing a card and reassuring me with my account safety. The online system is very easy to navigate and very forthright. I check my statement every month. With this account there are no hidden fees. I appreciate a company that does it's business well, especially when it comes to banking. I would highly suggest banking with American Express.",2015-01-17
2678,A decent bank.,19768,791,American Express National Bank,21476,4,"Like most banks, American Express has it's pros and cons. They usually have a very quick transfer time. Usually when I send my money to the bank, I see it the next day. There was one situation where I had recently pulled out most of my money to pay rent, and then received an unexpected bill for Netflix. It caused me to go overdrawn, but since 24 hours passed before I was able to get more money into the bank, I received a late fee. I was so frustrated because I knew that if I had only been given just one more day, I wouldn't need to be charged. I called them up, and although it took a little bit of patience to get through all of the automated system and customer service, I was able to get the late fee reversed. I really appreciated their willingness to work with me and give me a chance.",2015-01-17
2679,Best for simple users!,19704,791,American Express National Bank,21369,5,"I wanted a simple savings and checking account that I could access while I was travelling and in my fast pace lifestyle, I didn't have time to wait to switch banks and get new credit cards, etc. American Express added in my regular credit cards (I can check the balance on them with a simple refresh button all in one place so it's quick and easy) and they also gave me a debit card I can use while abroad with no extra fees. There was no fees at all to open my account, as well as no monthly fees which was incredibly surprising. I was hesitant at first because I have never worked with Amex or any of their companies that they branch with, but I have never been more satisfied with any other bank! This is simple to use, easy to open (and quick!) and it does everything that I want it do. It might not be for more intricate people who want every bell and whistle, but it's perfect for the every day banker who does not want any hassle or strange fees popping up in their account!",2015-01-13
2680,A Pleasant But Costly Experience,19551,791,American Express National Bank,21153,4,My experiences with American Express Bank have been on and off. The bank itself is quite well known especially throughout the nation. When i first opened up and checking and savings with them the overall experience was quite easy and handled in a professional manner. Everything was done online and they didn't require too much personal information than any other bank. Overall their customer services is very good as they always have short wait times on phone calls and answer my questions expertly and efficiently. The one downside to their services is the high fees that they charge for this exceptional service. Most of their accounts require monthly or annual fees to maintain in comparison to other banks around the country. Although their fees are high I have not felt insecure while putting my money in their hands. Their mobile services like apps and online accounts are very convenient and east to use. Overall my experience is very satisfactory and only hindered by the high fees that are incurred.,2014-12-31

I have to set up alerts of transferring money which I think should be a standard feature. My checking account provides overdraft protection which can be offset with my savings. Since Express has been around for a while its pretty much an house hold name. This means the number of free ATM machines I can find around my local area is immense. They still have yet to develop a mobile app which is crucial in today's banking I rate it 7 out of 10.,2014-12-27

It is a no risk, no fee, simple account. I have had the account for just over a year and am very pleased with the customer service I have received. My calls are answered quickly, and all of my questions have been answered. The website is easy to navigate, and use. The account return is the highest I have found for online banking. I plan on continuing to utilize this account, and hopefully growing my savings. I would recommend this account to anyone looking to build a large savings, that would like a guaranteed return. There are no risks, no fees, just a high interest rate for a simple account. As long as you have enough savings and want to have more, I would definitely give this one a thumbs up.",2014-12-17

I have been using American Express for many years, the only time I've ever had to contact their customer service was when I was traveling abroad and the foreign bank charged me many hidden fees, when I contacted American Express they said they would refund some of the fees this one time and warned me to always check with banks before withdrawing in the future. I thought it was a very kind gesture on their part and the customer service experience was great. Outside of that I have never had any issues and think its a very reliable and trustworthy place to keep your money.",2014-12-10

Now, I've been a life time Master Card user, so I never had even a credit card with them. But I was looking into high-yield savings account, because I'm looking into buying my first house, and I'm saving up for it. I applied with them, and it took no time at all to be accepted. I really liked the fees, the site was easily accessible on both my phone and my laptop. What I liked the most is the customer service, and the fees. The fees reasonable for once, and every time I had even a bit of problem the customer service was more than helpful, and was very patient with me with my questions.",2014-12-02

The .8% interest rate is relatively high compared to similar savings accounts. All deposit and withdrawal transactions that I have made have been easy to make and trouble free. I believe it generally takes between two and three days to appear in an account after a transaction has been made. Although I would prefer it happened quicker, overall that is not too bad. <br/> <br/>The web page is easy to navigate. The only thing they could think about changing is developing a mobile app, although there is not necessarily a huge need for an app for a savings account. There are no minimum balance requirements, but I believe you are limited to six transactions a month, which is not a huge issue. Additionally, once you have opened an account, it is very easy to open a separate account for different savings purposes.",2014-11-11

American Express makes it easy online to navigate through settings. I don't have to go crazy and look all over the place when locating my statements, making external transfers, viewing past transactions, etc. The page is always readable and the options are readily available and easily found. I am also happy that I don't have to pay any fees for all the simple actions like external transfers. No minimum amounts to transfer too--you can end up with no balance in your savings and it's all good. Lastly, customer service can be easily contacted and they're very knowledgeable and respectful.

Coming from ING, where the quickest transfer is 3 business days, American Express is normally 1 business day - a refreshing surprise. <br/> <br/>I have read where other websites might have a slightly higher rate, but if you value helpful customer service and ease of use, then none are better in my opinion.

Wells Fargo security was so good that the thief couldn't get the online access (despite having all the information). American Express Bank was terrible! The thief (a male) was able to call the AM bank, pretending he was me (female), and wired $15,000 out, on the same day! Whenever I deposit funds into AM bank, they needed 7 days to clear! When we finally chased the money and transferred it back to AM bank, I had already lost condifence in AM bank and wished to close the account right away, I was told by the AM bank that they had to wait 10 business days to clear the funds! The next day someone else at the bank transfered the funds back to my wells fargo accounts. All of these inconsistencies just made me believe that it was a right decision to not bank with AM bank in the future. I think enough said. I wouldn't recommend this bank to anyone.",2012-07-30
2695,"Bad Web Interface, Poor Mobile Functionality, Disingenuous Notification Policy Or Lack Thereof",9497,791,American Express National Bank,8231,1,"I opened an interest bearing Personal Savings Account in March 2012 knowing I would have family summertime expenses in May and June, so I had intended to make several transfers to another external account. The last 2 transfers that I executed simply *never* happened. There was no email saying the transfer did not occur, no web interface alert, no phone call from Customer Service, there was *nothing*. After the first failed transfer, I checked my account via mobile phone and saw that the website was down. Absent *any* notification, I assumed that perhaps the first of the two failed transfers were a result of the weekend outage. The following business day, I attempted another transfer and waited. For those that do not have an AMEX Savings Account, it is important to note that while walking through each step of the transfer process through the website, the completed transaction *appears* to have been executed without issue. Immediately after executing the transaction, you can even check under the ""Scheduled External Transfers"" weblink and the transfer shows up. After the second transfer failed to occur without notification, I called Customer Service. Initial interaction was perfunctory, but detached. After explaining my situation, the representative said that there is a Federal monthly limit on savings account transfers (6) and that I had reached my limit. After escalating my manner of communication complaining that omission of digital alerts seems less overlooked and more disingenuous, the representative admitted that many others had called and were equally apoplectic. To add insult to injury, I was informed that I would have to wait an additional 2 weeks before I could access any of the funds in the Savings Account. I'll be taking my money out of this account and I recommend others be advised before using any company that has problems digitally notifying account holders of account-related issues.",2012-06-12

After I verified my bank account, they transferred my money the next day. Well, due to Birthday and Christmas shopping, I had to request another transfer of my money (It says that you can have up to six transfers per month and this was my second). Well, I assumed that my money would be transferred just fine because the first transfer went smoothly, but no, I discovered after I recieved 3 overdraft charges from my bank that they dropped the ball. When I called to report the failed transaction, the girl said that they needed ""more"" verification from my bank to transfer more of MY MONEY. I told her that is ridiculous if you have already transferred my money to the account that I have already previously verified to refuse to transfer money to that account the very next day. So, I told her to close my account on December 17th, at 12:23 am. I recieved an email on the same day stating that it would take 2-3 days to recieve my money and I checked my account with AX and it showed a zero balance. I patiently waited until today, December 24th, and when I called the young girl, Jessica, said that they talked with my bank on December 19th, and were informed that my bank account was closed WHICH IS A BOLD FACE LIE! They now refuse to send my money in a check, because of policies and procedures? This company stinks, it was not worth the forty cents interest that I made in this nightmare and now because of the holiday they say that they won't be able to do anything AT ALL until December 27th. If you are certain that you won't need the money that you put in savings and are happy in taking risks that you may never see it again, then by all means, use AX.",2011-12-24

I opened an American Express card (via Costco) about a year ago and had a merchant-related scam-type problem, which Amex was absolutely fantastic in handling it expeditiously and very professionally. A few weeks ago, I opened an Amex money market account - and I was extremely impressed by the immediate availability of high-level cordial competence of the American Express rep who explained all the ramifications, pros and cons, and important points involved with whether placing a large sum in a money market was the best financial move, given my circumstances. WOW . . . I found my norstromesque online bank! They may not be offering the best prices, but I can depend on their integrity and premium quality service. Hard to put a price on my peace of mind.

They've started charging overdraft fees out of nowhere. If an overdraft occurs on your account but you head to the ATM and pay it before a fee occurs, youve satisfied that balance right? Wrong! According to chase representatives their system takes time to update and even though the account has a positive balance, they still overdraft for a $35 fee and it's not a one time fee it's a reoccurring fee. Yes you get charged daily!!! For the same charge. I'm switching! Chase is flat out stealing from their customers and the representatives are clueless as to how to solve the problem they just keep reading whatever script they rehearsed at the time of training for hire to deal with you and its annoying and frustrating. The best bank to go to HANDS DOWN is BANK OF AMERICA I've had an account with them about the same amount of time as chase and have NEVER had a problem. When they were talking on the news about Banks profiting off of charging customers ridiculous overdraft fees believe me you they were talking about JP Morgan SPECIFICALLY. From someone with experience take my advice bypass Chase Bank. The ""bonus"" they claim to give you when you sign up will be taken back through fees.

I reported the issue though I don't feel like it went anywhere. <br/><br/>I'm extremely disappointed with the customer service and quality of security. I opened this account with a bonus offer but I will close it once the 'probation' time has completed so they won't retract the bonus. <br/><br/>** Also, if you have put a freeze on your credit for security reasons - when they need to check your credit to open an account they used a credit bureau that charges a fee to lift the freeze. (if you live in the indicated states). Just a heads up on that.",2019-01-12
2716,They Have A Convoluted Closing Time Which Helps Them Collect Fees,34848,100,Chase Bank,52668,1,"So I had my wife deposit money into chase account because I knew it would go negative. She put the money in her account, but could not transfer because she could not login to the app or the computer for the past week. By the time she told me, I transferred; but it was a half of an hour too late. Which was at 8:30pm, apparently the banks can run on their own clock and 24hr period.<br/><br/>So I got hit with 2 overdraft fees totaling $68 and they would not take it off per policy of once per year because of a bank error they made earlier and now the ""computer"" can't do it. <br/><br/>But the worst part of it is they rearranged my debits to make 2 overdraft fees instead of one. I did not purchase these things in that order, they re-arranged it to steal more money than they should have.",2018-08-24
2717,Avoid Chase Bank,34795,100,Chase Bank,52529,1,"Not friendly; it’s a ‘cold’ banking environment. Absolutely no personal service. It was easy to tell that you could never expect them to help you out with anything or do certain transactions without charging fees.<br/><br/>Takes forever to do any one thing with them. Usually need to call to two or three other phone numbers, teams – and in the end none of them have the power to actually resolve an issue (which they created).<br/><br/>Took 2 hours to set up an account, which takes about 30 minutes at an efficient bank. They are more interested in figuring out how to get more of your business and charging fees rather than servicing you.<br/><br/>Screwed up our business account which resulted in them accidentally closing it, and making our already purchased checks (which we had paid for) worthless, and needing another business account opened, taking even more time. When their corporate group had a question on the business account, they didn’t contact us by either phone number or either email account. They sent a letter, which by the time we received it was too late to answer their question and keep account open. This was all because the business check we deposited was for ABC Design vs ABC System Design; this made them suspect fraud - they don’t know how to resolve or verify what is likely a very common business issue.<br/><br/>They have a corporate group which handles some things, and the local vs the corporate have no idea of what is going on, and cannot resolve things between them. They have absolutely no communication, and blame the other group and neither takes responsibility or can fix anything.<br/><br/>Transferring money between two of their own Chase accounts, personal checking and business, results in a 2 day hold. Putting a business check from their own bank into the personal checking account results in a 2 day hold.<br/><br/>$15 for incoming wire in transfers ($10 is going rate today).<br/><br/>For regular personal checking: No free checks, minimum balance, no interest (which I didn’t care about), and requires a direct deposit for no fee, regardless of minimum balance.<br/><br/>Their ‘Bill Pay’ is difficult to use and setup. The problem (and it’s a big one) is that you cannot see a total of pending transaction dollars (they show a view of pending intermixed with already processed bills). You must add them up the total $ pending yourself. Also, their website separates the pending transactions for your Chase credit cards in one place versus pending transactions from other payees. This makes it especially hard to tell committed bill pay dollars in order to ensure there is an adequate balance in the account.",2018-08-17
2718,Chase checking and savings account,33951,100,Chase Bank,50858,4,"I have been with chase bank for over six years now and am very satisfied with their products such as the college checking account and their savings account. With the savings account, they automatically transfer 25$ each month to avoid the monthly fees which as been really nice because i can transfer it back to my checking account any time. With the savings account i have up to six withdraws allowed, after the six withdrawals i will start to gain a penalty fee. The checking account is really great as well. Since i am a college student, i get the checking account for free without any monthly or yearly payments. It has been nice knowing that chase bank will take care of me. The only thing i dint like is that their savings account interest rate is only 0.01%! Which means that i gain only one cent per one thousand dollars entered in the account. The customer service representatives are very nice and treat me as a loyal customer, they call me by my last name and respect me as a loyal customer. I feel like i am very important whenever i call chase bank! The website and mobile app for chase bank is very modern and looks very expensive.

2720,Pretty good,32830,100,Chase Bank,49791,4,My experience with Chase bank has been pretty good. I've been using them as my main bank since i was eighteen years old. They're very keen on identity fraud. The customer experience i've had when i've dealt with identity fraud has been to my liking. Everytime i go to my local chase bank the employees there are very friendly and are willing to work with you when it comes to opening a new savings or checking account. The only problem i have ever encountered is their 300 dollar minimum for opening a checking account. If you don't have a minimum of 300 dollars they'll redact 5 dollars from your account every month which i find extremely annoying and morally unethical. All in all i recommend chase bank to anyone looking to choose a new bank for themselves.,2018-04-13

I have banked with them for a year and a half now and they gave a great incentive to where if you set up a direct deposit and had a certain amount coming in every month you got $200 for free. That was nice, other than that banking with them has been nice, the tellers are always pretty good and are prompt in handing deposits or withdrawals on my account. The atm has eaten my money several times though, but I guess you can expect that with any atm these days. One bad thing about Chase though was they denied one of my claims of a fradulent charge on my account which made my account go negative. Since then I have stopped banking with Chase.",2018-03-30

I had received a promotion letter which I had taken along with me to the chase branch while opening the account. I was told to wait and in around 10 minutes a representative from the bank took me to his office and I was informed about all the different types of checking accounts that they offered. The rep was very courteous and initially tried to push me for putting some money in fixed deposits which I politely declined. Once I confirmed the type of account that I needed to open, the rep showed me all the document requirements . Fortunately I had brought all documents that were needed. However to process the account it took the rep around 30-45 minutes. However the transaction went smoothly and there were no hiccups. I was told that my debit cards would arrive in a week or so.

2732,Chase Mobile Banking Review,30441,100,Chase Bank,45299,5,"I use the Chase Mobile banking (website and mobile app) to manage all of my different accounts. These include my checking, savings, credit card, and mortgage loan. I will discuss specifically my checking and savings accounts.<br/>I check my mobile app every day, usually a few times a day. Having this app makes it easy to keep track of my spending. Since I have a lot of ""auto payments"" taken out of my checking directly (energy company, netflix, water bill...etc.) I am able to make sure that the correct amount is taken out and that I am not incorrectly charged.<br/>Once, my phone bill was charged twice. The phone company claimed they did not do a double charge, so I called Chase. The person I spoke to filed the complaint and within a couple of days the second charge was refunded. I was happy with how quick and easy it was to fix this. If I had not had my mobile app to check on my account, I wouldn't have noticed this for a long time.<br/>As for my savings, I like having access at my fingertips because it makes it very easy to transfer a little bit of money each month from checking into the savings account. I takes just a few seconds to do it when everything you need is right there on your phone. On the flip side of that, if you need to withdraw from your savings, it is just as easy to send the money back the other way.<br/>I love the chase mobile bank and online banking. I do all of my banking online. I have been to the bank this year only to deposit actual cash. I even deposit checks through the app on my phone. It's that simple.",2017-11-21

2734,"Operationally, Top Notch.",30403,100,Chase Bank,43809,4,"Chase has a very well run operation. I have used their products for many years. Online management operates very smoothly and telephone assistance is easily contacted. They post promotional bonuses promptly.<br/><br/>However, one word of caution. I won't use their Chase Pay service as substitute for using my physical credit card. The reason is the terms they make you agree to in order to activate the service. Most of those terms are innocuous. But there is an indemnity clause that is so vague and broad that it could arguably be used to nullify the protection against unauthorized use that credit cards normally enjoy under federal law. I will not take the risk that Chase might interpret that clause in that manner and act accordingly.",2017-11-17
2735,Consistency is the key to online banking success,30198,100,Chase Bank,44619,4,"Since I pretty do everything these days through my smartphone, the chase banking app and website has been consistent with managing my checking account and getting me answers to any questions I have asked in the past. I recall an issue where I was the target on a card number scam which was linked to my checking account. I was able to find the information very quickly on the mobile app and have it addressed mid application through their online customer service via chat and phone call. I also like the fact that all checks and debits are immediately posted and allow for me to trace their origins, which helps me whenever I need to know when my car loan check processed through (which is a monthly endeavor) or when my job pays me. These days, I think I may only have to visit a bank maybe once or twice a year for the occasional check I receive, but even chase allows me to take a photograph of the check instead. And now that chase has the quickpay option through their site and app, sending money to my wife or mother and vice versa just makes everything even easier. I use quickpay the most out of all the options offered on the chase online features and it really is a godsend. I cant say enough about how consistent chase has been ever since they acquired washington mutual.",2017-11-09

I have both Checkings and Savings account from them. I have direct deposit set up at my job, and my money is always in my account instantly. I've never had an issue with not receiving payment. Also, the overdraft protection is better than other banks that I've used in the past. I have it set up that if I am going to overdraft, they will take it right from my savings account instead, to avoid the overfee charges. Their online banking is constantly up to date, and I get alerts whenever necessary.

I also like the chase money transfer which is very quick to mobile or emails. This has worked great even with foreign transfer.<br/> <br/>The only negative that I have towards this bank is the fees they charge on savings account to maintain the minimum amount deposited in the account and its not possible at times to maintain that so I end up paying $12.99/month as fees or penalty.

I also love using the online site to view all my bank statements through PDF form. This is also an earth friendly ""go paperless"" way to help the environment!

And when I was deciding between either a Traditional or Roth IRA, Chase had the necessary resources for me to help me decide with my investment objectives. And with regards to customer service, I have no complaints with Chase employees in person or over the phone. They have always been resourceful and available at my convenience. Their website is also very key to me. It's friendly user experience makes tracking funds painless.

Just take a picture with your phone and press deposit. I have used this feature many times and have never had any issue with it.

We did not need an appointment or anything, we came in with our paperwork, sat straight down with a banker/notary and had our document notarized within 5 min. Another investment banker from Chase also helped us pick out some mutual funds and explained all of our options and provided a risk analysis for the mutual funds we finally selected. He was very patient will all our questions and spent over an hour walking us through everything. All in all, every experience we have had with Chase has been really great.

The customer service agent was friendly and did not hesitate at all to help me in this regard. $12.50 amounts to roughly 2 meals for me so it a chunk of change to have to pay in unnecessary service fees. I have dealt with other banks who will refuse to do small favors like these. This is why I love working with Chase as I can get all of my issues resolved and resolved quickly. They have excellent customer service.,2017-06-21
2751,Highly Recommend,27769,100,Chase Bank,39013,5,Banking with Chase makes life much easier for me because of the down-to-earth customer service and their easy-to-understand website has evolved over the years into something magnificent. Usually when I deposit funds into my account it takes only one day. Chase has several different types of card whether or debit or savings and usually have low interest rates. I would recommend Chase to my family and friends simply because it is easy to use and client-orientated. The online banking is very easy with large font and buttons making it easier to click. it's easy to transfer funds between accounts.,2017-05-22
2752,Love this bank,27681,100,Chase Bank,38884,4,"I have banked with Chase since I was 18 years old. I have opened savings accounts for all my children with them and they even helped me with financial planning when I received a sizable inheritance. Their online banking is easy to use and I really like the ""quick pay"" online. A few years ago we had an identity theft issue. Chase notified us immediately! I was actually just a few days home from the hospital with our youngest son, so if they would not have not notified us, we would have been weeks before noticing. They also refund the fraudulent transactions while they investigated.",2017-05-05
2753,Great Banking.,27485,100,Chase Bank,38497,4,"I like this bank because it has made my life easier. I was in another institution before but felt the customer service and quality was really terrible. I like that its fast and easy to deposit money into a saving account, the money market is pretty good and there are several advantages. I like the way the staff treats clients. I remember one time when one of the cashiers help me step by step to complete a transaction. Overall I can say that ive had a positive experience, not only at the bank but also at the online site. I think the instutition is really worth the time and the investment. This bank is a 4.5 star bank to me. I like the speed that the bank has and in conclusion I think its a great bank.",2017-04-20
2754,Chase Banking,27475,100,Chase Bank,38487,5,"My experiences with a Chase Online College Checking Account have been extremely favorable. Granted it is the only bank in which I have a checking account, it is very easy to deposit and withdraw funds. I am particularly fond of the Chase app's check scanning feature, which allows me to deposit checks without having to go to the bank. It is extremely convenient. Additionally, the website makes it very easy for me to locate my account and routing numbers. In the past I have had to rely on having a checkbook nearby to give my routing number to websites that deposit money in my Chase account. The Chase site has these things very conveniently available to be checked in the main account area. When my account statement is posted, I can very easily check these and past monthly account statements every single month.",2017-04-18
2755,Chase Bank - Banking Online is Easy and Efficient.,27423,100,Chase Bank,38411,5,"I've banked with Chase Bank for about 4 years now and do mostly everything online. I opened an account when I moved to NYC after college and started my first job. I set up direct deposit right away and the money was transferred to my account seamlessly each time. Another way I banked online was to pay rent on my apartment. My landlord accepted direct deposits so once I month I just transferred money from my Chase account to his bank account. It took less than five minutes and there was never any fee. I lived at that apartment for 2 years and paid my rent online through Chase each month and never had a single problem. Another impressive feature of banking with Chase online is being able to deposit checks through their mobile app. If I get a check in the mail and don't have the time (or desire) to bring it in person to a bank, I can simply use the Chase app to take a photo of the check front and back and it automatically deposits the money into my savings account. This feature has been incredibly helpful as I've recently moved out of NYC to a town that doesn't have many Chase banks near where I live. I have been more than happy staying with Chase Bank even though there is not one near me because of how easy and efficient their online banking offerings have been.",2017-04-07

They have always had the most convenient locations for me and the customer service has always been efficient. I have tried other banks and it seems like it takes the tellers so long to complete a transaction. I also like that Chase now has the kiosks instead of tellers if you're in a hurry. I can deposit checks, withdraw money and check my balance so quickly. They have increased limits at the kiosks which make it just like going to a teller. Their online banking is also awesome. It is easy to deposit checks and transfer money between accounts. When I needed to open a savings account to go with my checking account, I easily did it all online. Chase Bank is convenient and efficient for my fast-paced life.",2017-03-31

It is now January 6, 2017 and have called to the bank to tell them that my account was set up but I have not yet received my $200. I have made 4 direct deposits and been told that they are sorry, but it shows I have been patient and have done everything that I am supposed to be doing.

They update the site every so often which kicks you out and disables you from logging in for hours at a time. I don't like the new user interface, either. It's confusing, and takes too many clicks to find important information. The mobile app is ok. Chase likes to hit me with hidden fees about once a year when they change their policies. I've had both good and bad experiences with their customer service. A couple of times I've had their reps talk down to me and try to guilt me about incurring fees.

2760,Go with Chase,25651,100,Chase Bank,34225,5,"I was introduced to Chase Bank through my place of employment. There was a rep. that came out to talk to us about the benefits of using Chase and their direct deposit system. The rep was very nice and extremely knowledgeable about the services offered in his company. I felt that way because he was able to easily answer all of my and my coworkers' questions. I felt as though he was thorough enough I would give the bank a try. Still skeptical of what the service would be like once they had my money, I actually went into a branch to have someone help me set up my online account which was also a great experience. There were no super long lines because their were plenty of tellers. I was able to get the assistance that I needed without a bunch of hassle and everyone was very friendly. The online banking always worked flawlessly and never gave me any trouble. I really have all great things to say about Chase with the exception of the banking fees which is only because I don't like them but only received them for things that I know about, so I never felt like I was being surprised by anything. I had a checking and savings account with direct deposit with Chase for about 2 years when I decided to switch to a much smaller and local credit union. But as far as big banks go, I think I could say without thinking about it twice that I would definitely open an account with Chase Bank.",2016-11-29

2762,Chase Is Heartless,25005,100,Chase Bank,32916,1,JP Morgan Chase is the most horrific heartless bank out there. <br/>They closed my mothers account without notice and reason. She is close to 90 and a holocaust survivor <br/><br/>Her social security and German pension checks were returned to their respective sources causing a great deal of effort to retrieve them. All of her auto pays were bounced and it was only because she had some spare cash at home that she did not go hungry. This was done with 2 days warning and additionally her accounts were frozen. She is also legally blind. <br/>Nazi Germany behaved much the same way. <br/>Chase is ruthless and will stay away from them for the rest of my life.

Easy to do bank recons, quickly check transactions and do all your banking right on that screen. As mentioned above, now it's useless.

The funds WERE AVAILABLE for a close of Escrow BUT NOT accessible for a wire transfer OR cashier’s check because they said there was no signature card on file. After producing the partnership agreement, fictitious name recording, identification and presence of both partners and waiting 45 minutes they said it would take 4-5 days to get the monies available. All it took was a call to our other financial institution and our wire was done in 20 minutes. Now we are stuck with trying to close the account and tying up a large sum of money for days.

2765,Review of Chase Bank.,23987,100,Chase Bank,30446,5,I've been a member of Chase bank for a good amount of time (ever since they absorbed Washington Mutual). Luckily I haven't experienced most of the common complaints I hear about other banks. Chase does not charge me a monthly maintenance fee for having my checking account. There are a multitude of locations throughout my neighborhood and adjacent neighborhoods throughout South Florida. I also really love the fact that Chase offers free Notary services for those who are members. I have had several issues with my account due to fraudulent activity and Chase was always there to make me whole. Chase has always attended to my needs and insured that my satisfaction was of the utmost importance.,2016-05-26

I think I'm so happy proves how sad I was when I was with Wells Fargo. I have poor memory, Chase lets me choose ""No"" to overdraft decision. From now on I don't need to worry about horrible fees on unwanted overdraft any more. And customer service from Chase is great. I forgot to update my bank account information, and then have delayed the payment to my credit card for a few days, when I called them they waived the fee happily and told me if I foresee a delay next time I can call to let them know so no fee will be charged at all. With Wells Fargo? Oh, I've never used their credit card at all. But the checking account charged me 6 times of overdraft within a day and when I called them to ask for help to waive the fees, they said No because it's not a bank error.",2016-04-07
2768,Worst Experience In Banking...,23274,100,Chase Bank,28496,1,Chase like to close out accounts or shut down online access and make you go into a branch to verify things. The branch did not even want to help. Chase has wasted so much of my time....,2016-02-23
2769,Chase Bank - Walk Away,23241,100,Chase Bank,28358,1,"This last summer we chose Chase Manhattan Bank to go to for a home mortgage loan. A couple of reasons: large, well known bank and my wife has an account there; also they have branches close to us (where we used to live in Ohio). We chose the one in Brunswick, Ohio - wrong move. Chase really does not have the 'personal/ home mortgage' process in place! Things went awry from the 'pre-approval' phase, thru loan processing, underwriting (it was like the first time they had done one!) then to closing! A real mess, cost my wife and I a lot of time, grief, redundant, replicated work, and even - money! And, we have found out it wasn't only us who ran afoul with Chase! So, are you looking at that big, blue neon, Chase sign above the building - walk on by!!!!",2016-02-16
2770,Best Bank!,23192,100,Chase Bank,28200,5,"My experience with Chase has been GREAT over the past few years. Every time I go in there the tellers greet me and ask if I need anything else after I sort out my business. When I need to see a banker about my checking account they work with me and make sure what I need to do is done efficiently. I am never told nothing can be done there is always something they will do that will satisfy me. I love going to the ATM to deposit my check, its so convenient than going inside and writing a deposit slip and waiting in line. The receipt even prints the check image on there if you want, but you have many options.",2016-02-09
2771,Mobile Check Deposit Is Misleading,22453,100,Chase Bank,25985,1,"I have been a Chase customer for years and have 5 accounts with them. I always go to my local bank and deposit my checks. However, I have always wanted to try the mobile check deposit, as they advertise it to be so more convenient. I have a car payment that comes out of my account every two weeks. I deposited a check on Saturday night before Columbus day. To make sure my funds were available for Tuesday withdrawn for my car payment, I read the apps deposit information which states, ""Deposits made before 11PM will be deposited the next business day. It was Saturday before 11 PM, which would make my check clear on Tuesday according to the app. However, on Tuesday the money was not available. I called the bank and they said because it was a weekend it takes and extra day. Now how is that convenient for me? I now have a check that isn't going to clear and a car payment coming out and they are going to collect a NSF fee, all because they did not tell me about this extra day because of the weekend. I would have keep the check and went to the bank on Tuesday because it was a Chase on Chase check that would clear immediately. So I am NEVER using the apps again to deposit checks. BTW Chase, it is not convenient to keep customers money longer because it is a weekend. Most people get paid on the weekend and can't wait till next Wednesday to pay their bills. I suggest you change your apps to reflect that weekends you hold money longer, because the way it reads now, it is misleading and false advertising. Your misleading statement on the app, which I relied on to make my deposit, has caused me damages, in the form of NSF fees from your bank and a fee from my car payment bank. Not to mention, when I called to speak with your customer service department, my experience was less than desirable, and could be describe as flat out rude. Chase misled me and possibly many others and has cause may customers NSF fees that could have been avoided. If they should have worded the app differently to alert their customers before their deposit to reflect that weekend deposits take yet another business day. This is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.",2015-10-13
2772,Set Up To Charge Overdraft Fees,22331,100,Chase Bank,25623,1,"I used to have a very convenient feature on my accounts where I would receive a text alert if my checking account has a low balance. All I had to do was reply to the text with the amount I wanted to transfer from my savings, and done!<br/>About a year ago Chase removed this feature without letting me know. I noticed it when they started charging me overdraft fees of $34 each. I complained but to no avail, they removed one of the OD fees and acted like they were doing me a favor. So they talked me through setting up the text alerts, but then I got hit again with another 3 OD fees! I called to complain but they left me waiting to speak to a supervisor. Then 2 weeks later I get hit again! 3 more OD fees! I was so upset I went to the local branch, the banker was able to determine why I wasn't receiving the text alerts, it turned out to be some flaw in the system. He fixed it and I received a text on my phone immediately after he fixed the issue. So naturally I'm expecting to have those OD fees waived, since it was a Chase system error coupled with the fact that I had sufficient funds available in my other account. But no. They told me they ""literally can't do anything about it"" and slyly blamed me. I had been with Chase for over 20 years, since it was 1st Chicago, so I got tired of paying these unreasonable fees and took my money out. They did reverse 2 OD fees but that still left me with another 5 totaling $170!<br/>Last year alone, banks charged over $30 billion in OD fees, so I don't expect other banks to be much better. But it will be the time Chase gets anything from me. I am moving my money and my mortgage elsewhere. I hope stealing that money was worth it for Chase.",2015-09-23

I now have a Credit Card, Checking and Business account through them. I love that they offer transfer options between other banks and find the customer service to be extremely friendly. I use to over withdraw a few years back a lot. I just wasn't managing my money well. So called Chase & spoke to a Rep and told her how I really hated being hit with the fees. She assisted me in setting up email alerts when I went over a certain amount and an analysis tool that helped me see what I was spending most of my money on. Well I do not over withdraw anymore! I really like Chase and trust them with my money.",2015-08-23

I personally have experienced great results as well. They have a fantastic mobile app and even a service that allows one to text a code to the bank and immediately receive your b balance. This is very handy for a quick balance check without having to login to the app. Everything I have seen is very secure with multiple verifications required before any new device log in is allowed.

2780,My Chase Bank Review,21464,100,Chase Bank,23795,5,Chase Bank in my opinion is the best bank to bank with. I have had several bank accounts in my life and Chase is the only bank that I never had issues with. The customer service was always top notch. Any time I ever had a concern someone within the bank was able to help me in a timely manner. My bank statements were always very easy to understand and checking my account online was never an issue either. I have experienced with other banks that sometimes checking my account at odd hours of the night just confused me. But with Chase everything was always clear and precise and I was never left wondering what I had just looked at. Another thing I love about Chase is they have locations all over the place. It is never hard to find a convenient location. And I appreciate that Chase does not cause me added stress in my already stressed life. Chase is definitely the bank for me.,2015-06-11

I have a checking account with Chase, which is called ""Chase College Checking."" This account allows me to have a $5000 spending limit, and in addition, as long as I supply them with my college transcripts, I pay no fees whatsoever as long as I don't overdraft. Chase has the option of having a savings account too, although I do not have one at the moment. After speaking with customer service on a few occasions, they are very friendly and eager to help every time. Although I have no experiences with Certificates of Deposits (CDs), I know that Chase accepts them and has no problem with you using them.

2783,Chase Checking Review,20731,100,Chase Bank,22658,4,"I received a flyer in the mail a month ago about a sign up bonus for opening a Chase checking account, it was free money so I thought why not? So took the offer to the bank and open the checking account for Chase, took about 30 minutes and I was done. To qualify for the bonus I need to make a minimum $50 deposit to open the account and set up direct deposit totaling $500 a month within the next 60 days. Took 2 weeks to get direct deposit set up from my employer and after that it took about 3 business days for the bonus to show up (they said 10 so that was a plus). <br/>I like the convenience of having a Chase bank to be walking distance to my house. The people their are friendly and would automatically give me my account balance even when I don't ask for it. The Chase app is cool because I like to do the mobile deposit feature where you take a picture of a check to deposit it which I think is neat. The other cool thing was I recently refinanced my mortgage with chase so I also qualified for the 1% cash back from opening a checking account with them as well. I do have to keep the checking account open for at least 6 months otherwise they will take the bonus paid to me back but that is not a problem. A $250 direct deposit every 2 weeks satisfies the conditions. Over all I'm happy with this bank.",2015-04-01
2784,One of the best banks out there,20500,100,Chase Bank,22374,5,Chase is one of the best banks out there. Their customer support is amazing and they are very helpful with whatever problems you are having. There was one time my car was broken into and had my wallet stolen. I had to go to the bank to cancel my cards and get new ones and they were very helpful and friendly. They helped with every step from canceling my cards and getting new cards in under one hour. I feel they really care about their customers and want to make the customer happy. Their rates are also very competitive and you cant go wrong with them. I have had my account at Chase bank for over 5 years and so far it has been one of the best choices I have chosen in my lifetime.,2015-03-10

2786,Not the best for travellers/expatriates,20294,100,Chase Bank,22166,3,"My bank is JP Morgan Chase. I lived in South East Asia for five years, during which time I frequently needed access to my bank account and credit cards. I handled my banking through the Chase website. It is easy to use, fluid and fast loading even with the primitive wifi connection I used overseas. A few difficulties I had were that the website was often down for maintenance when I needed to use it, as their maintenance time was in the daylight hours in the country I was living in. Also the large fees for international wire transfers made it difficult for me to transfer cash between my bank accounts in both countries. When I was ill overseas and tried to be admitted to a private (and more hygienic) hospital, I needed to use my ATM card to make a large deposit, but my card was declined and I was not given access to my funds. I therefore had to wait for a family member to transfer the money to me before I could enter the hospital. Since I have been living stateside again, however, I have not had a single problem with Chase and it has been adequate for all my needs.",2015-02-25

If you have a Chase account, read my experience, and others on this site, and get your money out of there while you can!<br/>Chase bought both my mortgage and my credit card from other institutions. It made sense, therefore, when they suggested that a Chase checking account would be convenient, especially since there are no Chase branches within hundreds of miles from my residence. On-line banking would make things convenient. This week my access to my on-line accounts was closed, due to ""Recent activity."" Hours on the phone and escalating to their executive office got me only a promise that I'd get a response within 24-48 hours. A week later I got a call after business hours refusing to tell me what suspicious activity surrounds my accounts, and offering the only way to access my accounts is to go to a Chase branch and document my ID. Yes, they do understand that there is not a branch for hundreds of miles from me, No there is no other recourse, NO they will not tell me what suspicious activity is happening. They suggest I just send them checks from another bank to keep my mortgage and credit count paid up. I see other reviews in which accounts have been closed without warning, I can only wish they would do me the courtesy of closing mine. I never miss a payment and never overdraw my account, so I understand that I am not a profitable customer for their consumer banking services, but that is no excuse for lack of integrity. I have no Idea how I will get my money from them, or the mortgage documents I need for things like tax preparation, how I can monitor credit card activity or keep up the payments. Short of taking days off work and driving or flying to a Chase bank I am in limbo with no recourse, and their ""Executive Office"" thinks this is appropriate service under their terms of service.<br/>The only reason I give them 1 star in this sites ratings is because it will not accept a zero star review.",2015-02-20
2788,Great bank for checking,20243,100,Chase Bank,22092,4,"I have been using Chase for many years and I am very satisfied with the business. The main account type I use with them is checking. There are many branches around my areas if I ever need to drop by and handle account situations in person. What I like the most about Chase is their customer service. when ever there is strange activity with purchases, I get an update to verify and make sure everything is okay. This has saved once when my credit card was stolen. They put a hold on the unauthorized purchases that happened before I could report my card stolen. I was able to cancel the purchases and get a new card with little trouble. Chase is a very dependable bank and I recommend them to anyone looking to start an account.",2015-02-18
2789,Banks are scams and this ones the worst,20137,100,Chase Bank,21921,3,"I knew a guy who worked there as a personal banker. They tell you that they like customers with high balances who are good with their finances, but what they really prefer are customers that overdraft cause then they can charge them a bunch of fees. I had an account there and they would make it so that they held my transactions till the last minute so they knew I would overdraft. They tell their employees that overdrafting is an unavoidable part of a checking account but its a lie. Overdrafting was invented about the same time as credit and debit cards so they could make more money off of you and afford to give out free checking.",2015-02-10
2790,Nothing like family,20094,100,Chase Bank,21871,4,"We love Chase Quick Pay. My sister and I use Quick Pay to send money to each other almost instantly. Although this really benefits our children with their fundraisers and raffle tickets most, it doesn't matter that we are states away and adds one less thing to our lists of errands.",2015-02-07
2791,Totally Overrated,20091,100,Chase Bank,21867,3,"So I got a chase account when I got some money as a gift from parents. I decided I need a bank account to keep my money safe. So when I set up my account I particularly and very specifically told the bank representative that I didn't want overdraft. I also found that I was slightly willing to overlook the monthly fees, because the bank was located right down road, so it was convenient for me. However, I quickly realized that they charged me hidden fees, and over drafted my account. Charing me 60 extra dollars to my account. So now they want me to pay me money, going so far to threaten my credit account, and at this point I will pay them over my dead and rotting body.",2015-02-07
2792,"Reliable, Friendly and Convenient",19939,100,Chase Bank,21677,5,"I have been a Chase customer for over five years now after several unsavory experiences with a few other banks. Signing up for my checking account was easy and free and the people at the branch were very friendly. I did not feel pressured to purchase other accounts or add-ons, which was VERY important to me. On return trips to the branch I have always had a positive experience. Employees are friendly and helpful. <br/> <br/>Aside from this, I am most happy with the convenience that comes with being a Chase customer. The website is easy to navigate (with a very interesting rewards page!) and the Android phone application allows me to deposit checks without going to the bank. This has saved me so much time and hassle. I also use Chase Quick Pay to quickly send money to friends and family - it's secure, fast and much better than going to an ATM to take out an inexact amount of money. I LOVE CHASE!!",2015-01-31
2793,Good Overall Experience.,19802,100,Chase Bank,21523,4,"While I have not gone too in-depth into the services that chase offers, I have opened and maintained a checking and savings account with them for just over ten years now. Therefore my rating about their competitive products may not be the best judge for that area. I have, however, had an experience that allows me to rate their customer service, I feel, pretty accurately. I used the Drive-up ATM at one of their locations and deposited 6 $20 bills for a total of $120. The machine only counted 5 and was only going to deposit $100. I cancelled the transaction and was given 5 new 20s. I went into the location and was greeted very nicely by a banker who opened a case for me in about 15 minutes. I said I would like to be notified by email and 2 days later I was credited the $20 and got an email with an apology. Can't ask for anything better than that. Their mobile application leaves something to be desired for me, personally. As fees go, I don't really like the way that they do it. I am a teacher and therefore have no income during the summer. My account has to have either $1500 or a direct deposit of $500 or more monthly in order to not be charged a fee. So during the summer as my account slowly dwindles with no deposits, I am often charged fees for 2 months. My other experiences have all been very basic, but pleasurable, and I would recommend chase to anyone.",2015-01-22
2794,Automatic Pay Nightmare,19715,100,Chase Bank,21393,3,"I used to make my apartment lease payment using the automatic bill pay. After using it for 6 months without problem, things took a bad turn.I always pay my rent a week ahead of time. Imagine my surprise when the site manager knocked on my door on the 6th of the month to say my rent was unpaid. l immediately checked my online account and saw that my rent payment had been debited from my account. I called Chase and spoke with a rep who said that my rent check had been sent. They asked me to verify all my info,which I did. They advised me to wait for another 5 days to see if it showed up. I told them I couldn't do that because I was in danger of more late fees and a 3-day notice to pay or quit the property. I told the rep to void the check so I could write another check directly to my management company. They would not do it since their info showed the money had been sent, and they suggested that my management company had misplaced the check. I called my management company,and they assured me the payment never arrived. I showed my property my online payment so they would know it was not my fault. They seemed to understand and said they would give me a few more days to see if the check arrived. It didn't. The management company started to pressure me to give them another check. I couldn't write another check because Chase would not void the payment and credit the money back to my account., and I didn't have enough money in my account to write a replacement check. I went online and cancelled all my automatic payment accounts. I called Chase and asked to speak to the branch manager. and after I ranted and raved about my predicament,he finally agreed to void the payment and put the money back into my account. I immediately paid my seriously overdue rent by personal check. This was on the 21st of the month! A couple of days later I checked my bank account and found that the automatic bill pay had again debited my account for the rent that was due in a few days. I was livid. I called Chase, and they claimed they had no record of my cancelling the àutomatic bill pay, and had already sent the check to my management company. I was furious,but I was pretty sure that a second check surely couldn't get lost. I was wrong. Once again the payment never arrived at my management company's office. On the 11th of the month, I took a bus to my Chase bank branch and demanded to see a vice president. I was so upset that he immediately cancelled payment on the second check,p ut the money back into my account, gave me a free cashier's check and made sure it would never happen again.. Three weeks later ,both voided rent checks arrived at my apartment management company. Chase never admitted any wrong doing in the whole fiasco.I have never used their auto bill pay again. Thankfully,my management company never charged me any fees,and my personal checks always reach them now.",2015-01-13
2795,Chase And Access To Account Information,19511,100,Chase Bank,21113,2,Using their investment services means that you cannot access<br/>any of your accounts from just any computer. Washing Mutual was so much better.<br/>You must allow these cyber morons to install a cookie on your computer. This is then a weak link in your security which makes you more vulnerable to hacking. Find another full service bank,2014-12-29
2796,Bank Policy Put Me In A Bind,19490,100,Chase Bank,21093,1,"Had a Visa Account with Chase, always paid my balance every month to keep a good credit rating. Didn't realize that I hadn't used it for a year, went to the garage for repairs, tried to use my card for the bill about $2600 dollars, card was declined. I wrote a check and looked into the problem. Chase has a policy that if you don't use your card it will be terminated without notice. I won't bother getting another card with them, that's inconsiderate to make such a change without notice. I travel often, what if I were out of state and was checking into a motel, I would be furious.",2014-12-28
2797,Satisfactory,19495,100,Chase Bank,21096,5,"I have used chase bank for approximately 2 years. I do not have very much interaction with them since I use direct deposit for my paycheck and do not really do much beyond that, but they are always very friendly when I do have to go inside. They were extremely helpful in making me aware of highschool and college checking without pressuring too much. When I got ready to go to college, they were very friendly and patient with switching it and making polite conversation while doing so. I'm not certain that I'd recommend this bank for those with more complex banking needs, as I have heard some bad things about them such as excessive fees for withdrawals in excess of your account balance, however Chase does offer a convenient app to accurately track your purchases, as well as a friendly and inviting environment to those who just need a checking account.",2014-12-28
2798,Chase is one of best bank in my opinion,19469,100,Chase Bank,21065,4,"I already tried to work with some banks in US but only Chase bring me satisfied experience. Custom service when I come to work with local branch is very good. Bank staffs work very effectively. Everytime, I come for transactions such as deposit, withdraw money are done in very short time. Moreover, their attitude to customers is very polite and professional. When I getting trouble with direct deposit in my workplace, I came directly to Chase local branch. They deal with my problem almost right away. Then, giving me some advice if in case the problem rising again. I feel like the customer service is always available when I need help. Moreover, I also use online banking application in my smartphone. This application is very simple to use with a very user-friendly interface. For me, Chase is the bank I ever worked with.",2014-12-24
2799,The best big bank,19471,100,Chase Bank,21067,4,"I've been banking with Chase bank for many years now. They are by far the bank that I've had the best experience with on the big branch scale. One of the benefits that all big banks have are that there are branches and ATM's everywhere you go. I have found chase to always have a close proximity to me, wherever I am. Secondly, they have the best customer service from these big banks. I am always greeted with a smile and a greeting when I walk in. Anytime I've needed help with my account, there has always been a personal banker there to help me. I've never received any hidden fees like I have with my prior bank. Every so often, the personal banker associated with my account will also take the time to meet with me to see if he can improve my account in any way. My personal, business, and investments are with chase and I've never had to worry about my money. If I have a strange transaction, they are always there to make sure it is me that is making that transaction. Their security is amazing. The only thing I can gripe about is that I pay a monthly fee for my upgraded account and the pricing for it could be lower in my opinion. But you get what you pay for I guess.",2014-12-24
2800,Chase Review,19137,100,Chase Bank,20714,5,I've had great experiences with chase bank. I am on their college student account and I have not had to make any monthly payments of any sort. I also am not required to have a minimum balance in my checking or savings account which is extremely helpful although there is a $300 fee to begin a savings account which I have not had the money to start yet. One thing that I have observed that I do not like is that they are no longer accepting those without chase accounts to deposit cash into my account. The person has to either write a check or give a money order which can be a little inconveniencing. The mobile site is fantastic. Any time I go into a chase bank their customer service is great and it's a very professional environment. It was very easy to start an account there and there are many locations for banks and ATMs.,2014-12-04
2801,My opinion about Chase bank,19128,100,Chase Bank,20705,3,"I will give my opinion about Chase bank compared to Washington Mutual. I applied to Washington Mutual Bank but eventually ended up at Chase bank, with much fewer benefits. My experience with Chase bank is somewhat negative. Before the great recession I was with Washington Mutual, and was very happy with them and their service, then the recession hit and Washington Mutual failed, with that, Chase bank bought them out. Soon after Chase began putting in new products and fees all, which were not as good as the products I had under Washington Mutual. An example of these changes was my free checking under Washington Mutual; Chase added a $10 monthly fee. Chase also canceled two of my credit cards stating that I did not use them enough; therefore, Chase was canceling the accounts. All these increased fees and canceling of my accounts has given me a negative impression of Chase bank.",2014-12-03
2802,My Bank Review,18960,100,Chase Bank,20494,4,"I have been a customer at Chase for many years. They have always been very helpful and friendly. Once, I had some trouble and over drew my account twice in a row. They charged me two $34 fees but reversed them upon request. Another time, someone evidently stole my card number and did some shopping in places i don't go. Chase called me immediately and I had my money back in my account in less than an hour. I'm staying with Chase thank you.",2014-11-21
2803,Not WaMu but Not Bad Either,18778,100,Chase Bank,20240,4,"I was a WaMu customer for years before the takeover by Chase. I honestly loved WaMu and was really disappointed in the takeover, transition, etc. I honestly didn't care for Chase for maybe the first two years of the takeover. Now though, I've come to like Chase in many ways. Firstly, their ATMs are everywhere! Its so nice knowing you can withdraw money, deposit money, etc. so conveniently and quickly. Second, the app is great! It is probably the best phone banking app out there! Customer service in the branch is very good but telephone service leaves a lot to be desired and I generally avoid it. I have never really had a very good experience with their telephone customer service which is disappointing and unfortunate as I can't always go to a bank. That said though, the bank customer service tends to be better than average. Bank staff are always professional courteous. All and all, I am much more pleased with Chase now than several years ago and I can't see leaving Chase for another bank.",2014-11-04
2804,excelent banking services,18653,100,Chase Bank,20072,5,"it almost 2 years i am working with chase bank, the bank have plenty of Branches as well as ATM Machine which my banking service flexible, Bank have very friendly & helpful Customer care services, The banker are the branch are kind & helpful, they are open to help me out all the possible ways, <br/> <br/>Most of time i check my balance online, feel chase.com is one of the secured website on which we trust easily, Site don't allow you to login from unknown location, also if you login from unknown location it will ask you for secondary login details i.e. one time password so that authenticity of person login is verified, <br/> <br/>Also the bank alert you if you they see any transaction on you account which help you to protect yourself from fraudulent transactions, also bank have zero liability possible means that if any fraudulent transaction is made on your account you will not be held responsible for the same, which most required in now days",2014-10-28
2805,Chase What You can't Find,18652,100,Chase Bank,20071,3,"I have been banking with Chase since they were Washington Mutual. Washington Mutual was above par, totally free checking, no minimal balance, no fees to use other Bank's ATMs, there were locations all over the place. <br/> <br/>I waited through the change, thining things would be the same if not better, with Chase. I was assured that there would be more ATMs and branches. Not the case. The ap is almost completely useless in the event of actually finding a location. You're better off using Google Maps. Forget about Chase in Gainesville, FL. <br/> <br/>Then the fees. No free checking, nope not grandfathered in or anything. Nope, nope, nope. Sometimes, your savings account will terminate for no reason. Just a few of the perks with Chase.",2014-10-27
2806,CHASE - Worst Bank In America,18631,100,Chase Bank,20034,1,"I made the mistake after depositing $15 into my Chase account of asking a simple question, ""Do I have sufficient funds for now?"" The cashier charged me $15.07 to answer that question and put me in the hole by 7 cents. Instead of asking me to pay the 7 cents or by correcting my misconceptions that questions are free to ask. Chase charged me $25 for putting me in the hole by 7 cents. When I queried the $25 charge for 7 cents - they told me it was standard policy because I owed them the 7 cents. So I stopped using my account. I then get another hit of $25....because I did not pay them the first $25 and 7 cents. I was gob-smacked. How dare Chase treat their customers like dirt. I will pay them the $50.00 and 7 cents and then I am closing my account. Since I make $250k a year they just lost out because they charged me $50, and stole my $15 for a simple question.",2014-10-24

2808,Best Bank for New Graduates,18425,100,Chase Bank,19788,4,"Chase is a very convenient and accessible bank. The fees that are charged are simple and reasonable. This is an excellent choice for recent college graduates who don't need fancy services and just need a bank to save and use money quickly and easily. The mobile app has helped me save so much time since I got it, and I don't think I have actually had to go to the bank or an ATM since I got it. Deposits are processed quickly.",2014-10-22
2809,"Reliable, many ATMs and locations",18414,100,Chase Bank,19777,3,"I use Chase bank purely because it is available in many locations. Previous banks that I had used would always present an issue becuase I tend to move frequently, and my former banks weren't always very accessible. Now, everywhere I've moved there is a Chase right down the road, not to mention numerous ATM locations. My only complaint about Chase is they have the standard iffy and sometimes clandestine fees for silly things, so every now and then I am bummed to find a $35 dollar charge.",2014-10-20
2810,"Chase Bank, Meh Fees",18390,100,Chase Bank,19753,3,"I've been with chase for a few years now. Mainly just no-fee credit cards. I have one for Amazon, one for cash back (got it for the sign-up $200 bonus for $500 spent), and a checking account for some cash back. My complaint is mostly with the checking account, as I know not to get credit cards with fees and pay it off at the end of every month. <br/> <br/>The checking account charges $12/mo fee if you don't do direct deposit into it, or maintain an unreasonable minimum amount in the account. I think this is silly, especially considering I know how many free, fee-less checking accounts are available out there. I'll be closing the account once I've claimed the bounty on the account.",2014-10-14
2811,Medicority is on Par,18374,100,Chase Bank,19738,4,"I consider Chase to be a ""mediocre"" bank, basically, because they have pros and cons with each of their services. For example, if something bounces, they will charge both for the bounced fee and a negative account fee, so basically, you get double charged. However; they also allow your account to go negative as much as $5 with no fees at all. Their credit cards are not the lowest interest rates, however; they also have options for people with poor credit and some pretty good rewards programs. Customer Service over the phone is no good, you might as well be calling another country because they typically put you on hold for long periods of time, and have trouble following your questions and finding solutions. The call center once accidentally closed all of my friends account, when they were actually supposed to be closing her mothers accounts. On the contrary, in-person customer service is excellent. I have never had anything but a friendly teller and I have seen personal bankers in the branches go above and beyond for customers. One personal banker helped a little old lady who didn't understand the internet sign up for direct deposit online. Another personal banker called the call center for a customer. For best customer service; develop a relationship with an in-branch personal banker.",2014-10-12

At a time when the car broke down they allowed me to skip a payment to help pay for it. As the car was only 2 months old at the time this was going above and beyond.

Although, I use only few of their services like deposits & withdrawals, I find QuickDeposit to be very convenient. I think they were the first bank that introduced that feature, it saves me a lot of time & the hassles of driving & going to the bank. I just take a picture of my signed paycheck & it's done, it will be credited to my account the following day. And if I want to pay somebody, I just use their Quickpay, I can send and transfer money using my mobile phone. <br/> <br/>Their staff are very professional & friendly. I remember, one time, they called me to inquire if I used my debit card & made some purchases online in Israel (of all places) while I was here in California working. My debit card was used fraudulently by some crooks & they reversed the charges & refunded me the whole amount. They were quick & very accomodating. Long live Chase!",2014-10-07

I have been extremely satisfied with all my interactions with Chase bank employees. They've always been helpful and extremely polite and professional.

2816,Why Didn't We Let Them Fail?,18199,100,Chase Bank,19508,1,"I am generally a cautious and money savvy customer and was forced to work with Chase after the WaMu take over. I have/had my mortgage, HELO, private and business checking and credit cards with them.<br/>I thought with a FICO of over 800 I am in good shape.<br/>I am a fan of online and mobile banking and Chase was always at the for front when it comes to technology. However, they just closed ALL my checking accounts, the private ones and the business ones. The bank managers are usually worthless when it comes to answer the question why and the phone customer service just hides behind their policy. After some research it boils down to the government initiated ""Operation Choke Point"" ! read up on google. you are deemed as security risk... Soon to be retiree Mr.Holder and the Dept. of Justice are clamping down on the banks to streamline their books and business. <br/>So they decided in their compliance dept. what companies and people are deemed risky. I heard of Gun shop owner for example, I just sell motorcycles in and out of the country. <br/>Don't get me wrong, I had an excellent relation with the tellers at my local bank. Now I start from ground zero again establishing relations with banks and CC companies. And for all of you who praise Chase for now, be aware, it does not matter how good of a customer you are or how long you are with them.....at the end of the day you/we are just a number. Now since I spent the last 2 weeks looking through the fine print and pros/cons on other banks, yep, they are pretty much all the same. We should have let them fail!",2014-09-28

2818,The Best of the Big Banks,18069,100,Chase Bank,19305,5,I have been a long time Chase customer. The main reason why is that they have tons of locations and you can find their ATMs everywhere.

Chase Bank has assisted me in overdraft protection and sends me alerts if my account is getting low. I get to choose what balance my account is before alerts are sent. They have great credit options and options for business accounts available. They have drawings around Christmas time and you can when up to so much money around then. My checks from work are direct deposit with Chase and I have never experienced any problems with them.,2014-09-16

2825,Worst bank ever.,17719,100,Chase Bank,18764,1,"I banked with chase after WaMu went under and was bought out by Chase. I never had such a bad experience with a bank before until chase. Their ""fees"" were downright extortion, as i was forced to pay $10/month in order to keep my checking account open. On top of that, they would assess other fees for what seemed to be no reason at all. My final strike was that they took the liberty of closing my checking account without my consent. I didn't use my account much at that point, but that was the last straw. I wont' be banking with them ever again.",2014-08-29
2826,Review for Chase,17716,100,Chase Bank,18761,4,"Chase bank is a good, solid bank for the Midwest user. Has a tiered system where the more money you have with the bank the higher status/perks are afforded to you, similar to most banks. In general there are a lot of ATM locations and branches in Chicago which make it a convenient and great bank to use. Customer service is also very good and lines are short. The website is okay, security is good but the formatting could be improved and sometimes navigation is sketchy since hitting 'back' on the browser does not work too well with the website.",2014-08-29
2827,Cheap no frills banking,17712,100,Chase Bank,18757,4,I have been with this bank through the Washington Mutual acquisition. Their services have stayed consistent through the years. Fees are resonable but do not expect stellar customer service. I try to avoid the brick and mortar banks and utilize the ATM and mobile apps as often as possible. I do not find the branches to be adequately staffed and most of the services I use have been automated.,2014-08-29
2828,Chase - A great bank,17711,100,Chase Bank,18756,5,"Chase bank offers all the usual services-credit card services, payment of bills, savings and checking services. They have a great mobile app that shows your credit card purchases, your savings and checking balances and offers the ability to pay your bills. You can also transfer money from 1 account to the other. Their customer services inside the bank is superior. They go out of their way to help you and are extremely friendly. There are many locations and ATM services are free at all Chase ATMs. Some branches offer safe deposit boxes to store your valuables.",2014-08-29
2829,Chase Bank,17555,100,Chase Bank,18451,4,I have loved having an account with chase. The have always been so so helpful to me and my family. Whether it been my checkings or my savings I feel like I can really trust them. Their mobile tool also makes it really really simple to do banking from home. The fact that I can check my accout whenever I want is just fantastic. It also helps that they have locations at nearly every walgreens store. I love walgreens so the partnership is a make made in heaven for me. Chase bank makes everything so simple and i love it.,2014-08-18
2830,Decent,17536,100,Chase Bank,18432,4,"My experience with Chase has been pretty decent over the years. I initially banked with Washington Mutual, but then it was bought by Chase and I was too lazy to change banks. Using their web services is fairly easy and quick. There are no fees to utilizing web services such as checking your accounts, viewing transactions, transferring money, paying credit cards, and more. I once had a very suspicious charge to my credit card and reported it via a web form and within a few days, the charge was removed and my money was back in my account. Also, several times they said that my credit cards were compromised, and they sent me a replacement card immediately. Their ATM's are easy to use and can be used to deposit checks and cash into. I can't remember the last time I actually went into one of their locations. There are some fees, however, to using their service if you don't deposit enough money or keep enough in.",2014-08-14
2831,An Excellent Bank,17528,100,Chase Bank,18424,5,I've been with Chase for about 7 years now. They have been quick to respond to questions and any requests I have like ATM card replacement. I needed a new card 2 times in a short period of time and they did not charge for either. They have offered me good interest rates on auto loans and my credit card through them is the best that I have. Their online banking is really easy and makes life a lot easier. I will continue to bank with Chase and hopefully soon will apply for mortgage through them.,2014-08-13
2832,Chase Bank Review,17452,100,Chase Bank,18304,5,"I opened my Chase checking account, and credit card (Freedom Card) a few months ago and I have been nothing but happy. They offer good rewards, and the checking features are great! The bank employees have also always treated me well when I go to a branch. The credit card rewards are also much better than my previous credit card so that makes me very happy! I do not like the fees associated with the checking account; however, they are pretty easy to get around.",2014-08-07
2833,Chase Through the Years,17290,100,Chase Bank,17990,4,"Chase has actually been surprisingly nice to work with. Although the occasions have been rare, when something does go wrong they usually get it fixed up fairly quickly. However, there has been a ton of run around when trying to settle things over the phone, sometimes taking upwards of 30 minutes just to straighten things out. <br/> <br/>At first, they used to put a block on my card if I bought something out of state. Sometimes an online purchase would put a block on my account. Eventually they started to figure out my shopping habits and I had them notify me over email whenever a big purchase goes through. Their online banking has been absolutely wonderful. Everything is streamlined and simple. <br/> <br/>Overall, I'm glad to have made Chase my bank of choice and will continue to keep them as my personal choice of bank.",2014-07-26
2834,Fees Fees Fees,17268,100,Chase Bank,17968,3,"Chase has pros and cons. The in house customer service was always outstanding! However, my two calls placed to the 800 number left something to be desired. On one occasion I asked them to fax proof of payment to a debtor. I was told that they are a bank, not a fax service! The other time I had asked to place a freeze on my account and was told I could only do that at a branch office. So I drove over 50 miles to get to one and found out that is not true. <br/> <br/>If your checking is overdrawn, you have until 11pm to make a deposit at the atm, which is nice. The atm's don't require envelopes. <br/> <br/>Chase was offering a $100 reward for opening a new account and following a few steps, which I did. After a year or so I had overdrawn my account. They paid the overdrafts and charged me a fee. $37 per item! I was grateful that they paid the overdrafts to a point. Unfortunately, I had several auto pays set up and this had a snowball effect. I asked them to make my account a ""deposit only"" or ""freeze"" my account. They refused. Chase became a bigger entity than myself or the employee trying to help me. <br/> <br/>My overall opinion is that it is a nice bank as long as you don't make a mistake in your checking or ask them to for help. It's like they hand you a rule book when you open an account and then you are expected to be the perfect customer or you will pay out of your pocketbook.",2014-07-21
2835,Decent bank,17217,100,Chase Bank,17855,4,Chase is overall a decent bank. They always answer quickly if you need to call them but most of what you need to do can be done online. I like their mobile check deposit option as well as overall options in their mobile app. The online experience is decent - regular for a bank I would say. In the branches most people are nice. They are hit/miss with verifying you via SSN if you don't have an ID with you though.,2014-07-15
2836,Decent Bank,17214,100,Chase Bank,17852,4,"Chase has a lot of branches which is very convenient for anyone. However, the interest rates on the checking and savings accounts are very low (you can easily find higher rates out there), and there are other fees that get to be a pain. A certain number of withdrawals from savings will incur fees, and ATM fees are taken from both Chase and the ATM itself. Otherwise, their site and app is great and you can do a lot of things from them (including taking a picture of a check to deposit it). They also offer a number of decent credit cards. I'm sticking with them for now.",2014-07-15
2837,As a blind person,17003,100,Chase Bank,17396,3,"My experience with Chase has been a mostly favorable one, but there are obviously many ways the whole process can be improved. Because of my vision impairment, I have to place a very large amount of trust on whoever I deal my business with at the bank, which makes me uncomfortable and weary about my dealings with an associate I am not used to. The process I feel could definitely be improved by having a large majority of the paperwork digitized and letting each associate have direct and portable access to these documents with some way for the computer itself to read the paperwork out loud for me to verify, and an option to email all requested documents to my personal device so I can see them as well while I am still at the bank on my own equipment.",2014-07-07
2838,Best Bank By Far,17000,100,Chase Bank,17393,5,"If you are looking for a bank that offer it all, you need not look any further! Chase has everything you will need in a bank. Their customer service is excellent, which to me, it the most important thing when finding a bank. They are secure and offer excellent online banking solutions as well. I've been with Chase bank for over 8 years now and I have never had a complaint thus far.",2014-07-06
2839,How I feel about Chase,16999,100,Chase Bank,17392,4,Chase bank is great. I love the service. They are located all over the south and where I live. The also are located in every walgreens which is my favorite store of all time. The coupling is great for everyone. The online service is very convent. When ever I feel the need to check my account all I have to do is look on my phone. I once encountered a possible credit card fraud and all i had to do is call in and they stopped it and refunded me without any problem. Overall I love chase and I will be using them for as long as I can.,2014-07-05
2840,Chase nothing fancy but be careful with add on Fees.,16981,100,Chase Bank,17374,3,"Chase is the one of the largest Banks in the U.S. and it is extremely well capitalized, so trusting them with your money should not be a problem. I have had a chase checking, now two, for over tens years. Chase use to offer free checking with no minimal balance, now its with a $1,500 minimum or $500 direct deposit per month. If you drop below the $1,500 the just for one day in a month they will add on the $12 monthly service fee. But, if you have a long history with them and a decent overt all balance overtime, they may waive the fee, you must call them and ask to have it removed. Checking accounts are not linked so each account needs to have the minimum balance, but savings and checking are and also an investment account like an IRA; therefore, only one account would need to have the $1,500 to waive the fee. <br/>The interest rates paid on savings is very, you would do much better with an online bank and no interest is paid on my checking, which think is the same for all checking. I have a large balance in one of the accounts and still get no interest. <br/>When you call them their customer service is very good, a quick response and very professional and no phone bank in some far away country. <br/>On finally point, Chase is also an investment bank and sometimes in their branches they will have young bankers who may try to sell you some kind of investment product, usually for customers with a large balance. One young man even call me at home a few times, after I spoke to him at my local branch about a small issue I had with the account. I politely declined his offer and it was not a problem for me. <br/>You also may do matter buying checks from separate company who make checks, they could be cheaper than Chase's check. <br/>Overall a nice bank, good customer service, but just watch out for added fees.",2014-06-30
2841,Good bank if you meet their strict terms,16973,100,Chase Bank,17366,3,"Chase is a great experience with excellent customer support, an awesome mobile and online presence, and one of the largest chains of banks in the country so you're never far from a branch. The only real downside are their potential fees. You'll now need to have direct deposit or a minimum balance to avoid high monthly fees on their checking account. In addition, overdraft fees and other charges for mistakes have gotten more expensive. Assuming you never overdraft on your account and have direct deposit tied to it, you should have a pleasant experience.",2014-06-27
2842,Chase is awesome bank,16963,100,Chase Bank,17356,5,"Chase is a great bank to have an account with. Whether it's checking, savings, or a credit card they are just great. They have awesome customer service, great features and have been my bank for the past 7 years. A lot of the banks around me are closed after 5 and on the weekends, but all the chase banks have times that can meet my needs. The application and website work great for me to pay any bills or monitor my accounts.",2014-06-23
2843,Chase bank,16957,100,Chase Bank,17350,4,"I've been with chase ever since they were washington mutual. I think they were a better bank back then but I'm still with them. Call it laziness to change banks but how different are banks really. They have a monthy 6 dollar charge which is annoying but like I said, most banks do the same. Their online banking is pretty decent. The one thing really hate is the 24 hour hold on all checks.",2014-06-22
2844,My last 5 years experience with chase bank.,16950,100,Chase Bank,17343,4,"I am having my checking account with chase bank for last 5 years and my overall experience is very satisfactory. My bank manager has developed very good relationship with their customers and we can approach her any time for any issues.This bank is being here for 210 years which provides innovative financial services. It has very strong base all over the country with 20,000 ATMS and 5,600 branches. <br/>Their website and mobile app experience is very satisfactory. I can do almost every bank related transactions by website or mobile app which saves me lot of time. They have very good competitive products which helps customers like us better. Their fees are bit high compared to competitors but I would still prefer to continue my relationship with chase for all other good reasons mentioned here. I definitely recommend my bank to my friends and relatives.",2014-06-20
2845,"Excellent customer service, not excellent fees",16945,100,Chase Bank,17338,3,"I've had so many great experiences with Chase. When my wallet was stolen, the charges incurred from the thief were immediately back in my account. Forgotten pins, lost cards...problems have always been solved quickly and painlessly. However, I was recently between jobs and because I wasn't making monthly direct deposits or keeping enough money in my account I was charged $10 monthly fee. Not ideal. But overall, I'm very satisfied.",2014-06-19
2846,Standard big bank,16934,100,Chase Bank,17327,3,"I have been banking with chase for about 7 years now. When I set up the account I opted out of overdraft protection and have never had a single overdraft fee. The accounts have been free for the most part. I really like the website, I have had no problems accessing it or doing what is needed and have made use of the features like bill pay. Overall I would say it is a typical big bank experience.",2014-06-17

I was once filling up my gas tank, knowing I had the money to cover and when I went to pay, my card was declined. My account was missing short $50 which put me in the negative. After calling up Chase, it was determined that it was their mistake. They were nice enough to fix it right away and I do understand that mistakes happen.",2014-06-15
2848,DO NOT BANK WITH CHASE!!!!,17009,100,Chase Bank,17413,1,"I have been a customer with this bank for over 5 years. I had 3 accounts opened here. Up until about a few months ago, it was the only bank I used. About two weeks ago, I connected my credit union account to my checking's account at Chase so I could transfer money to it without having to go to the bank every week. Today, I sent my daughter to the grocery store with my card as I always do, and it was declined. I was sure she had entered the wrong pin or something so I called the bank to get the account unlocked. They informed me that they decided to close my account after reviewing it for security reasons! Security reasons? I've never reported fraudulent activities and they could not give me one good reason why they were closing my account! To add insult to injury, they immediately blocked online access to my account and told me that they would send any money's that are in my account within 10 business days of the last transaction on the account. So not only did they close my account for no reason ( I didn't have overdrafts nor declined payments), but they will be holding my funds hostage until they are ready to release them! I have never felt so betrayed by a business before in my life! I will tell everyone I can not to EVER open an account with Chase Bank!!!",2014-06-13
2849,Chase is a good business institution.,16819,100,Chase Bank,17124,5,"I've used Chase Bank for years now and I have to say, they have done a fantastic job managing my finances and other things I have with them. They're very intuitive in knowing what to do with my money and keeping an eye on it. In the past years I've had various security breaches of my identity but Chase has always safeguarded my money so I personally always had access to it while those other people did not. I highly enjoy going to Chase and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to start a savings account or a checking account.",2014-06-11
2850,My bank,16807,100,Chase Bank,17112,3,"I have been with this bank for over 20 years. At this point I don't know why, but I'll list some things they do well. They are pretty good about any fraud issues as most banks I would think would be but most recently I had a big charge pop up and they took care of the issues very quickly. In addition they provide you with a wide array of products you need. From mortgage,car and personal loans. All is avail through this bank. You don't get the mom and pop feel that sometimes I miss.

2851,Great Online Services,16717,100,Chase Bank,16983,4,"Chase bank really stands out in its website and mobile app. I am able to get regular updates through text message on how my account is doing, as well as warnings if my checking account gets too low. The website is very easy to use, seems well protected, and I have never had an issue with it. It allows me to transfer money between my accounts flawlessly. In person, my local Chase bank was very nice inside, and all of the customer service I've ever had to deal with was very friendly and helpful. I don't think I'm ever going to switch my bank if I don't have to. I am very happy with my experience with Chase.",2014-05-26
2852,Good Experience,16702,100,Chase Bank,16953,5,I have had a checking account at Chase on Long Island in New York for a few years. I am very pleased with their web site which makes it easy for me to follow my transactions and download or print them for tax purposes and record keeping. They have several easy to find ATMs. I also have a Chase credit card so I am able to do my banking in one place. The local branches are friendly and helpful. I cannot judge an experience with loans with Chase as I have never used them for that reason.,2014-05-23
2853,Chase Bank's Competence,16695,100,Chase Bank,16946,4,"As a student, I am afforded a great deal of leeway on banking - i.e. no required minimum quantity in my checking account, or any yearly fees. My experience with Chase bank has overall been stress-less with the services I've used: cashing in checks, withdrawing from atms, using the smartphone app to check my balances, and even currency exchanges (my miniscule chase bank in Edmonds, WA took in Polish paper zlotych, which was convenient).Additionally, for the 2 times I've had fraudulent charges on my account from online credit check websites, the customer service has been forthright with cancelling my current card, refunding me the charges, and delivering me a replacement card within a couple of days. Overall, I've had no qualms or issues with Chase Bank (other than possibly not offering certain features online that are required in person, such as opening a separate checking account on my bank account.",2014-05-22
2854,Chase Bank Review,16672,100,Chase Bank,16911,3,"I have been with Chase bank for as long as I have been earning income. So far they seem to be doing a good job, but I feel that they aren't as competitive as smaller banks because they are so large and have been around for so long. I feel that they should continually make an effort to draw in and retain customers to hold up their image. I will admit that they have come a long way since I first opened my account with them, including mobile banking which is a life saver at times. One thing I would argue is that their current interest rates are abysmal. If one thing could improve it's that. There is absolutely no incentive when it comes to opening a savings account unless you're in the top 1% of the economic ladder. Overall, I will continue to bank with Chase since I could literally find a branch everywhere I go (in NY), but if a competitor begins to be as common and convenient with better rates, I won't think twice about moving my cash somewhere else.",2014-05-20

2857,Why I'm Changing Banks,14529,100,Chase Bank,13829,2,"I'm a long term Chase customer, before Chase I was a WaMu and was fine with their service all along.  I've had some very positive customer service experiences, so no complaint there.  However I'm rethinking my loyalty having gotten a 6 dollar service charge, unexpected and very quick action on their part because I lost my job and no longer had direct deposit.   There was no heads up or warning and I had just enough funds to cover utilities before that unannounced 6 dollar service charge.<br/><br/> I'm starting a new job in two weeks. I was going to set Chase up on direct deposit and close the second account at had at a bank practically next door to me.  That 6 dollar fee that is going to make a payment bounce made the decision that my business is going elsewhere.    In fact, my direct deposit will go to the local bank close to me and I'm shutting my account at Chase immediately.  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/> This is not my first experience with unexpected fees from Chase.  Its probably in some fine print somewhere.   Another thing that has happened repeatedly was the denial of my debit charges when I had the money in the account to cover those charges.   I had to leave the checkout counter call chase and ask what was going on.  They simply declined because they were unexpected charges on my usually very frugal account.   This happened 3 times, money in the bank, plenty to cover it, denied card with people in line and trying to explain I don't know what happened the money is there.   I had to go into the bank in person to verify it was me spending my own money.... ",2013-07-20

Their customer service is as personal as the credit union's, teller hours are convenient, credit card customer service is prompt, friendly and solutions-oriented.

On and about 2008,  I have been trying to get someone to listen to me about this injustices.  You see, I put 85 thousand dollar in Chase bank.  But through many mystery, all monies dissappear, before the year January 2010!  On June 2009,  I put my social security check in as well through direct deposit, which is electronic deposit.  But my money somehow all went up in smokes, in about three months! For some unknown reasons, Chase allow someone to enter my account, with my checking account number, and put in $250 So I try to get account changed.  But I was ignored, as Chase think person of many disability is of no value, like stray dog roaming street! In the year of 2010, someone call chase and cancell my debit card.  But Chase fail to obtain my proper permissions for this change to my account with many of my monies from disability payment from prior years! <br/><br/> I found out when I tried purchase something, Chase was also double charging me; I have tried to set up appointment with the bank.  But I was ignored!!! I found in the beginning of this year, Chase deleted my account summaries, without my proper permissions,  after asking them not too!! No one contact me from the bank!!! Chase continue to tell me that thousands of my disability dollars was used with my debit card.  But that was impossible, as I believe in paying cash for all purchase! When I asked for investigation by security official, there was no letter informing me of investigation!  I told the bank and, they were aware someone in there office was stealing my money, some $45,000 dollars!  But Chase do nothing but ignore me & steal more of my disabilities check!<br/><br/> My Social Security check went so fast! I had thousand of dollar, when I added Social Security check through electronic direct deposit.  That money miraculously vanish into big air too! My identity was stolen! And Chase knew it!  But they think it's ok for criminal to scam me because I don't move around like healthy person working in Chase bank branch!<br/><br/> They knew it when they allow a woman on Nov 2011 go into my account and add money. I could not prove she added it, as it was deducted out of my account. I did not buy a purple car with giant rims & tires, or did I spend mult thousands of dollars.  So I ask for them to calculate the monies on my summary.  But they would not provide me with necessary assistances, as they think I'm stupid, due to my many obvious manifestation of physical impairment!<br/><br/> I was denied access to my account for one year, and was blocked from entering it. When I went to download it from another computer, most of my summary was blank, stating office use. I did save both summaries. Nevertheless, Chase delete the 2 account without my explicit permissions!!! My Social Security check should have not been touched, because I had a few thousands of dollars, before bank took moneys in bank account, as well social security, I have totally ignored by bank.  How does disability person get this unjust robbery reverse?",2012-12-25

It has been years since I actually went into a branch though. I keep my checking account at Chase and use their bill pay. I have direct deposit, so it is a free account. I also get cash rewards, albeit small, for using my debit card at certain merchants. I didn't even know this until I saw a small deposit in my account one day. As far as earning interest, I keep my excess at an online bank and transfer funds to Chase when I need funds. This works well for me.

The police has opened an investigation on this subject and has told me that is something that happens often here in South Florida. In my case they stole from me my debit cards both from BofA and Chase and used them in some ATM´s (obviously i gave them my PIN number, obviously against my will), and credited stolen 5,000$ cheks in both accounts through ATMs too.<br/><br/> Well, the thing is that just a few hours after the theft happened I cancelled my debit cards and the next day I made a claim at both banks both for the withdrawals and the credited checks. While in BofA returned my money to my bank account and opened an investigation on this subject, it just took two days to Chase to tell me that they considered the ATM withdrawals as authorized and that they where going to close my account!!! They did. So what am I? I think that I had enough beeing a victim of such a crime that involved a considerable danger and embarassment to me, but in addition Chase consideres me what... a criminal or something? In addition, this account cancellation is going to figure in my history forever... accesible for any bank<br/><br/> So as you can see I´m very disgusted with this bank, They can offer you the best but then when the time comes to help their customers to solve their problems I cant count on them so worst bank ever!!",2012-10-04

2870,No Such Thing As A Closed Account At Chase,10453,100,Chase Bank,661,1,"I closed a small business checking account 9 months ago, and a recurring transaction for a merchant credit card virtual terminal that I only used once a year at a special fundraising event posted. The charge was $38 which is fine there was a mistake the merchant company did not switch the fee account only the one for receipts. This caused a $35 overdraft fee so I wire transferred the $38 and $35 in one wire to zero out the negative balance but then they charged me an ""incoming wire fee"" of $10 which generated another overdraft fee. Needless to say I think Chase is ridiculous if an account is closed a transaction should reject not reopen because now I have to have the 4 business owners sign another letter requesting the account be closed else there would be a fee for having a $0 balance - this is not easy people have busy schedules and this is a waste of my time. I love how Chase feels it is appropriate to do this kind of bull crap.

A daunting list of requirements to be sure, but I have a check, so most of the work is done. No contractor will give a lein waver until his bill is paid, so I may have to borrow against this check. On 8/25 I went to the bank with the documents I had (1,and 2 and the check). I had no other borrowings on this property. I had a positive attitude and the knowledge that I will be talking to a person who knows nothing about the scary stories on the internet.<br/><br/> Twelve minutes later I left the bank with the check endorsed so I was able to use the funds that day. I spoke to an understanding, helpful  person and the process was positive professional and kind of fun. I acheived what I needed to do and it was just fine. The check was under $20,000.

The rep said ""but there's a more recent withdrawal"".  I pointed out that there was a withdrawal one day AFTER the statement period, therefore it should not be counted and, if it were, it would STILL BE within the 4 withdrawal limit.  The rep begrudgingly reversed the bogus charge with a $3.00 credit.  I pointed out to him that Chase has the most incompetent Information Technology department I've ever dealt with.  I will be closing all 5 of my accounts at the earliest possible opportunity.  THIS IS THE MOST INCOMPETENT BANK ON PLANET EARTH!!!",2011-04-30

I ask if she can just this time call the account holder and make sure the check is in the right persons hand and she says NO!!!!!!!! What has America come to? How can they change the rules and ways we have been doing business for years in this country and also be so very mean about it!!!! I had my uniform on and was just coming back from a job and even dough she was not presentable with her hair flying everywhere and just the way she carried herself and talked with me was the rudest I have ever witnessed!!!!

A person in a foreign country listened to me very politely explain to him the problem. Then he said he couldn't help me, except to put me on a do-not-call list, something that would take effect in about 30 days.  When I persisted, he asked for MY social security number.  I called again and talked to another person and they said I should try emailing Chase.<br/><br/> I emailed Chase, quite politely explained the problem, was emphatic in stating that I did not have a Chase account. The email said that he, Edward Silverio, could not do anything, that I should go online and log into my account.<br/><br/> Obviously intelligence is not a prerequisite for being hired at Chase for EITHER phone or email support.<br/><br/> As an aside, my girlfriend cancelled her Chase accounts a couple of days ago, citing ""Three-Strikes"" as the reason.

The one closest to me is tiny, but also has long hours - open till 6:p.m. and on Saturdays 9-3! I have decided to avoid the stiff ($8-9 per month) fee for the checking by depositing $5k into a roth Ira 13-month cd ... at a pathetic rate of .2%, I think, but it does qualify for meeting the deposit requirements and will allow my checking account to avoid the fee. One of the reasons I want to stay with Chase is that they appear to have great in/out bank to bank transfer capabilities, and I also hoarded up a LOT of those free WAMU checks!

The system transferred me to a credit card rep, then a banking rep, then an online banking rep. Needless to say it was annoying. Finally when I got to the online banking rep, I was so ready to cancel my application. But the rep told me that if I ""close within 6 months there is a $25 fee!"" Gotcha! ""OK, then, please tell me my routing number and account number so that I can set up the direct deposit,"" I said.

I have accounts with almost all the competitive high yield savings and CD banks out there, Citi is by far the worst to deal with.<br/><br/><br/>Transferring money in.. when you get an error saying that the transaction request was NOT completed... and there's NO record of it..<br/><br/>On 2 occasions. I had received this error and it still went through.<br/><br/>My external account was drafted two times for the same amount.<br/><br/>I called the clown show, and they could only see 1 request.<br/><br/>The second time this occurred, it put me at risk of over drafting my external account as it was a large transfer that I was not planning to have occur 2x's.<br/><br/><br/>The customer service is beyond inept. They will hang on up you constantly , transfer you endlessly, and ultimately resolve nothing.<br/><br/><br/>If you value your time and your sanity, stay away from these clowns. The amount of interest you earn is too little to deal with inept customer service and spending hours on the phone. <br/><br/>Speaking to others out there, I have heard nothing but horror stories and endless hassles.",2019-09-10
2934,Worst Experience Ever,38756,12,Citi,62463,1,"My Citi Accelerate savings account has been one hassle after another. I signed up about 8 months ago and it took three different attempts just to open the account. Then, linking my Citi credit cards with this account was impossible. I ended up having 2 different login's. I struggled with several attempts to get a portion of my funds transferred to an external account. I had to close the account just to get the rest of the funds I needed. Customer service is terrible. Hold times are excessive and you're usually transferred several times before you get to the right person, and that is if you get there at all.",2019-09-09
2935,Stay Away From Citibank!,38719,12,Citi,62347,1,"Saw the 2.36% interest rate online with no fees if $450 kept as balance so verified rate and terms with associate by phone before applying. Went online to complete opening of account. Got signature cards in mail but no verification of terms. Called Citi and it took very long time to get through to someone who didn't speak English very well and was told it was 2.16% interest with $1500 balance required to waive fees. He couldn't close account because transfer money not yet available.Called today, and closed account. Person I spoke to didn't care why I was closing it or that it took 15 minutes to get through today. She said she'll bring it to her supervisor's attention. Of course she will and then they'll fix all problems and no one will have to go thru all this crap again, right!!??",2019-09-05

2937,Worst Banking Experience Ever,38601,12,Citi,58629,1,"It was the worst banking experience ever. I went with CitiBank due to the name but that was the worst mistake ever. I signed up for promo that would give me $600 bonus after keeping my money there for 60 days. I wrote some checks out after opening the account but they bounced, I called and they said well you have to send back a signature to write check which I was never advised of. I said go ahead and send me the card and I sign it and send it back, I never got the signature card. I called back but kept getting runaround through automated system to do it electronically. After I fulfilled the 60 day I called them when I would get my bonus, I was advised you get it with in 90 days after you met the requirements, I said ok. few months go by I get an email that states congratulation you have met all the requirement and you will receive the bonus with in 30 days. 30 days go by no bonus I called customer service then the rep says you get the bonus in 90 business day from when I fulfilled the requirement. No where in the email did it says anything about business days. They are very Shady I would never bank with them again. I have CC with Home Deposit and Best Buy which I will be closing because I want nothing to do with CitiBank. I could have earned way more then the bonus amount had I kept the money in High Yield Savings Account for the amount I deposited. I couldn't withdraw my money either because if it fell below the limit I would get charged high fees. I didn't want to close the account because then I don't get the bonus. It's going to take well over 6 months to get $600 with the amount I deposited I would have gotten double that just keeping money in high yield savings.",2019-08-26
2938,Worst Customer Experience In So Long,38576,12,Citi,61989,1,"I am not sure why would they advertise for saving accounts if they want to make it hassle to open an account in the eligible states. They request additional documents then you call to follow up an every representative tells you something different. It's so frustrating, a lot of choices with better customer service out there.",2019-08-23
2939,"A Good Bank, Minus Account Opening Experience",38502,12,Citi,61821,3,"I opened a checking and savings account with Citibank in February of this year after hearing that in the 41 states where Citi has no branches, it now offers a high-yield savings account—Citi Accelerate Savings—with an APY of 2.36% (in comparison to my savings account at Chase, which has 0.01% APY). Unfortunately, account opening was very odd in that after opening my checking and savings accounts, I had to wait for my debit card to arrive in the mail (almost two weeks!) to be able to log in to my new account and add money to my savings account. Once I got my debit card, I activated it and was able to log in to my account. However, I had to log in to my account using the debit card number, my mother's maiden name, and password each time I wanted to check my account balances, instead of simply using my username and password. Also, my security passcodes had to be obtained by calling Citi rather than by getting a text message on my phone. It was like this for a couple of weeks until I finally called technical support, who told me that my phone number on file hadn't been verified yet—an option that wasn't available for me to do myself online. Once it was verified, I no longer had these issues. <br/><br/>Until this month, I had no more account issues. When I upgraded my account package, I got a notice in the mail of Citibank's deposit rates for the new package, but the notice was for Illinois (I live in Wisconsin). The Citi Accelerate Savings APY was listed as 0.04% on a horrible-quality document with a Citi logo that was pixelated and looked like one someone could've obtained from Google Images. I presumed the unprofessional document was sent in error, and when I called customer service, I was told that I was correct, and that I would still receive the 2.36% APY.<br/><br/>The Citibank app is probably one of the nicest-looking banking apps I have ever used, but I think the bank needs to work out all the bugs in the app and make account opening more seamless. For now, my Citibank account will be my secondary banking account. Chase may offer pretty terrible deposit rates, but I’ve never had issues with them.",2019-08-18
2940,"Fraudulent Promotion, Poor Service",38460,12,Citi,61728,1,"Signed up for an account because of a great promotion. It took over two hours on the phone due to the agent typing slowly and not knowing basic answers. They got all my transfer information on Day 1, but did not mail me the necessary signature page until a month had gone by despite multiple phone calls. I returned it on the same day, and was assured that my account was eligible for the promotion. Fast-forward 6 months. They say I am ineligible because they didn't transfer the money until the 32nd day of the account being open (30 day window). I called several times in the interim to verify that the account was on track and eligible. I appealed and was refused. Deceptive tactics. Closed the account.",2019-08-14
2941,Incredible Patience Needed,38425,12,Citi,61626,3,"I have to agree with most of the negative reviews. I started switching to Citibank almost 3 months ago. I'm still working out the bugs. Before I can write checks, they tell me I need a signing kit, but I don't have a local branch, and they can't figure out how to mail me the forms. Occasionally I get a competent customer service representative and a problem gets resolved. If you have actual bank branches in your state, I recommend this bank. If you're trying to do internet banking, they are not state-of-the-art and you will be extremely frustrated.",2019-08-11
2942,Horrible Experience!!!,38413,12,Citi,61594,1,"I made a savings account with Citi Bank and it has all gone horribly, because of their horrible customer service and website. When you call them, you get an automated person, who only helps you if you give them your SSN, banking number, or ATM card. Well, since I just made an account, I didn’t have an ATM card, so I gave them my banking number, which apparently didn’t work and I needed to use an ATM card number. So I asked to use my SSN, but of course Citi bank couldn’t find an account related to my SSN. Then I finally was able to contact someone via Citi Chat that told me that I would have to wait 24 hours to access my account fully. This is literally the worst experience I have ever had and I wouldn’t wish Citi Bank on my worst enemy.",2019-08-10

When I initially submitted the application they obtained several pieces of information from me. However, they did not obtain identity verification documents. A week and a half later I had heard nothing about the account so I called back to Citi's inept customer service department. At that time I was informed they would need copies of my drivers license, power bill, cell phone bill, social security card, and a signature card. I requested that a signature card be emailed to me but the customer service person told me signature cards can only be sent via USPS. The next day I surprisingly received an email requesting all of this information and it did include a signature card. I sent the information back to Citi promptly and called to see when the account would be open and available to use. I was told it would take 5-7 business days to verify my information.

Two days later got a call from citi saying it was now active, but I had missed the grace period for withdrawal and I’d need to pay a fee to withdraw. What a awful experience, unless your a millionaire don’t bother with this bank. Cd rates 4-2019 1 yr .25 rate, ridiculous, same as the prior year when rates have gone up a full 1.00 %.",2019-04-10

First you wait on hold for about an hour, and then I got a person on customer service tell me that I would be receiving a pin and a new card. I had no idea why they were issuing me a new card. Another week and a half go by. I call back again. This time there is no mention of a new card. The customer service rep says I need to activate it online and pins don't come in the mail I told her there is no way to register it online without a pin. She would not believe me and made me feel like a moron. Onto another customer service rep. This time he said I did need a pin and he would overnight one for all the inconvenience. <br/><br/>The pin finally came in the mail over a month after the card came. Now I register it online. It worked! But now I can't access my account. It seriously just takes me to my Costco Credit card account and nothing with my savings account. I call back in, and they again have no idea or any way to help me. I spent another two hours on the phone for no reasoning or help. <br/><br/>I just closed the account before I could even access the thing. This was the most insane banking issue I have ever had.

2954,Review of Citibank banking,33959,12,Citi,50866,4,"My experience with Citibank was fairly decent. I went into a local branch to open up a checking and savings account when I moved to Florida. Even though I called ahead, my wait time was almost 45 minutes before I saw someone to get the accounts open. Other than that the experience was pleasant enough. I only went into a branch 2-3 more times and that was to get documents notarized, which they did at no charge.<br/> <br/>The rest of my experience with them was via ATM's and online. The online website was decent enough. I only had a few minor issues which were either resolved by time, or calling customer service. They only had a few local branches and ATM's, which ended up being a concern and the reason I left them for another bank about 4 months ago. They were part of a network that allowed me to get free ATM usage but it wasn't always accurate. Which led to a few calls to customer service to get fees refunded.<br/> <br/>Calling customer service was usually a pleasant experience. But like most companies the phone menu and actually getting to talk to someone was beyond excruciating. My average time spent on the phone was around 15 minutes which I find unacceptable but not outrageous. <br/> <br/>Lastly, the fees were above what I was used to paying.",2018-05-28

I think like many of the other traditional and older banks, they think they just continue as is and not have to compete with new banks that offer innovating and exciting products. I had a checking and savings with CitiBank that I switched over. CitiBank didn't have competitive interest rates for its saving account. Now I get high interest rates on my savings AND checking account. CitiBank also did not reimburse me for ATM withdrawals at other banks besides CitiBank. Come on, its 2018, this should be offered by all banks. The web/mobile products also leave a lot to be desired in comparison to their competitors. The only thing I enjoyed when I used them was their customer service and abundance of physical locations.",2018-05-25
2956,Insightful banking experience with Citi,33882,12,Citi,50731,5,"I have been with Citibank for over 7 years now. After graduating from college and thankfully getting employed in the desired industry, occasionally I am obliged to travel with my supervisor overseas to meet with potential partners. I was very fortunate to have opened checking account with Citibank. Citibank is considered to be an international player in banking and have many branches worldwide. Thus, I manage to avoid many foreign transaction fees when using my debit card to purchase or get cash from ATM overseas. It has been very smooth, convenient, comfortable and satisfying to be part of this company. Wherever I go, I feel like there will be service that is managed by Citibank and I will avoid paying any unnecessary and extra fees on my banking transactions. On top of that, Citibank has an excellent customer service. Once, I remember I needed a proof of residence for one my application at different bank. I contacted Citibank and requested the letter from them as I had been with them for long time. In 24 hours, the letter was available online in my account and I was able to download it in PDF format immediately. It was very fast with high quality response to my concern. I hope I will be with them for many years to come",2018-05-23

The website was easy to navigate and I never had an issue where I had to contact customer support. I was weary of opening another checking account, but it was really easy with Citibank. My favorite aspect of the experience was their mobile app. I could easily check my account balances and set up autopay. I rarely use a computer except for work, so it was very handy to be able to monitor my expenses while on the go. I'll be sure to share my experience with my family and friends, because they're always looking for an easy, safe way to hold their money. If I could, I'd open another account with Citibank.",2018-05-22

2960,Citibank is one of the best banks,33794,12,Citi,50592,4,"I've been banking with Citibank for a few years now. When I first made an account with this bank, I only had a checking account and since then, I've created two savings accounts too. I think that citibank is definitely one of the best banks I've been a customer for. In the past, I've had TD Bank. Citibank excels in customer service, cost of fees, and accessibility to ATMs. TD Bank only allowed you to take money out of ATMs without fees at their branches. If it was an non-TD Bank ATM then they would charge you $3, plus the fee of the ATM itself. Citibank does not to that, so I think that is one reason why it is a superior bank. Their website an mobile app are convenient and easy to use. It has everything you could need, such as the ability to transfer money from one account to another without having to go into a branch. It also allows you to deposit checks right from your phone, so you can deposit paychecks without having to go to the bank. Their customer service is unparalleled. They are always available to help you with anything you need, at any time.",2018-05-18
2961,Lack of Customer Service,33790,12,Citi,50588,3,"I banked with Citibank for approximately 5 years and recently had to switch to another institution. My main issue with Citibank was the lack of quality customer service and slow response time to problems that had arose. At the time I had direct deposit from my employer and there had been three months in a row that there was an issue releasing my funds from a pending status at my bank. Using the telephone customer service line was monotonous, time consuming, and fruitless experience. Not only did it take several minutes to speak with an actual human regarding my issues, the ones I was able to speak with were unsympathetic and not understanding the urgency of having paychecks held for days after they were supposed to be released. I had one particularly bad experience with a phone customer service representative that refused my requests to speak with a supervisor saying there was nothing that could be done but just waiting for my funds to release. After about three months of circling with customer service leading nowhere I decided to pull all my funds and transfer to another institution. I was so fed up I even canceled my citi credit card and opened one with my new banking institution.",2018-05-18
2962,Customer Service is Outstanding at Citi,33776,12,Citi,50574,5,"The Customer Service provided with Citi is outstanding. I have had a business checking account and savings with them for <br/>4 years. I visit my local branch to make deposits daily. I am on on first name basis with the managers and tellers at my <br/>local branch in Coconut Creek, Florida where my business is. The bank will go out of its way to help you with any and all issues related to banking as well as community support for charity. I volunteer for a local charity and the bank has been a supporter for the local golf tournament that we have. <br/> <br/>When it comes to security and going the extra mile, I can't say good enough about my experience with this bank. I have had issues in the past with some fraudulent charges and Citi has backed me to get them resolved quickly with the least amount of stress. <br/> <br/>Their fees are very competitive, the staff and phone representatives are friendly. I would recommend them to any and all that need a bank who still believes in customer service. <br/> <br/>One last thing. The lines stay low when you bank inside because they are fast and don't want customers to wait. if there is a line and there usually is not, they will take your'e deposit for you in line and email you a receipt.",2018-05-15

The tellers at my local bank never knew my name or recognized me, even though I came multiple times a week to deposit money from work since I was paid in cash. Citibank had low fees, good benefits, and a comprehensive online page. However, the customer service I received on site and over the phone were both lacking. Twice my account was shut down because they said someone else was using my cards, but it was because I was travelling for work and buying gas in different states which I had told them about in the past numerous times.

2966,"Good, for the most part",33747,12,Citi,50545,4,"I started banking with Citibank in college. My bank at home didn't have any branches near my university and so I decided upon opening up both a checking and savings account at Citibank. For the most part I was satisfied with the bank. I was able to use direct deposit to deposit the checks I earned as a student worker. It was also easy enough to transfer money from one account to the other electronically. This was a huge plus for me. However, I did have one issue in which my account was overdrawn when it shouldn't have been. I had written a check (and absolutely had enough in my available balance) but the check bounced. Citibank informed me that I did not have enough in my checking account (untrue) and then charged me an overdraft fee. When I called customer service, I talked to someone who literally could not understand what I was saying. I had certifiable proof (a screenshot of my online checking balance the day that I wrote the check; no other withdrawals were made) and the person I spoke with kept telling me that my balance was short. I finally went into a branch to show them this proof and they were able to undo the extra charges. This should've been able to be taken care of with one simple phone call! But aside from this one bad experience, I had absolutely no issues with Citibank.",2018-05-13
2967,No Real Problems With This Bank,33740,12,Citi,50538,4,"Ten years ago, when I got my first job, I opened a new checking account with Citibank. Honestly, from the first day, I was very happy with how the customer service is at Citibank and felt like they took care of me carefully and really cared about my needs as a customer. I remember walking into that bank as a young man (18 years old) and not really knowing anything about banking or how I would go about opening my account. A woman brought me to her desk and went through the details of opening an account with them, telling me about how fees work, how many ATM's they had in my area, overdraft situations, etc. I was so happy that someone was taking the time to walk me through the way it worked because I was worried it would be too complicated for me in the beginning, but after talking to her she really helped ease my anxiety about it and make me feel like I had chosen the right bank for myself. I have been happy now for a decade with this bank, the website is very easy to use and functional, the fees are definitely reasonable, and the customer service is nothing short of excellent. I always recommend this bank to anyone I know.",2018-05-11
2968,Decent bank for a large company.,33103,12,Citi,50112,4,A few years ago I decided to open a second checking account with a nationwide bank. I choose Citi for there sign up offer. I was traveling a lot at the time so Citi fit my needs. The only complaint I had was when I called I was always transferred to a call center and it would take for ever to fix any problems that I might have had. Over the years I stopped using the account for everything but I still have it open to use when I travel.,2018-05-10
2969,Great customer service!,33086,12,Citi,50095,5,"I really like this bank. I have had many big banks in the past, and this one is by far the best out of all of them. I switched to this bank about 3 years ago because they offered lower fees for my 3 accounts than the current bank that I had did. They made the transfer from one bank to another very smooth and effortless. When I did have an issue with some fraud, I was able to speak to someone on the phone who was really interested in my needs and fixing the problem. This was very important to me because I did not want to do this without someone on my side and I felt that with this bank. Great customer service, they fixed the problem and even followed up with me a week later to make sure that the issue that I was having was resolved. I will continue to bank her for a long time to come.",2018-05-07
2970,Citi Bank Response,33074,12,Citi,50082,4,"Citi Bank is actually one of my favorite banks. I have had an account with them for many years. I have always had positive interactions and have found that their ""personal banker"" program to be very useful. The individual that I was assigned to at my local branch, is very knowledgeable in both the bank procedures and product knowledge. I did apply for both a home loan and an auto loan but their interest rates were a little higher than my company credit union. All in all I have been very pleased with this bank.",2018-05-06
2971,Average,33067,12,Citi,50075,4,"At CitiBank, I had a savings and checking account. I normally withdrew money from my checking and would occasionally add money to my savings (from holidays, extra cash from paychecks, etc). The services were fair, which is why i gave a rating of 4. The customer service was best in person and wasn't readily available on the app (unless you wait on the phone forever). The web mobile experience was good, however I found other banks such as Capital One and TD offered better mobile options and features. I had a difficult time with the institution when I withdrew money abroad. I received such a high international withdraw fee, when others banks like capital one reinbursed me for all those charges. The charges made me upset and I customer service didn't help much with fixing my anger about the situation. Overall, it's an average bank but I'd choose others.",2018-05-05
2972,Citibank Is A Great Place to Bank,33062,12,Citi,50070,4,"I've been using Citibank for years, and I've never had a problem. I haven't ran into any hidden fees and their customer service is top notch. Citibank actually provided me with the mortgage for my home. The loan officer was extremely helpful and I was able to get me a great rate. I also use the Citibank Platinum Select Elite Mastercard. This credit card has a great mileage program, and I was actually able to buy flights for a wedding next month with the miles I earned from the card. I work in a cash heavy business and the abundance of ATMs in my city make it easy to withdraw money whenever I need to. Compared to other banks I've used in the past, Citibank is a no brainer. I would never use Wells Fargo or Bank of America ever again.",2018-05-05
2973,Citibank Checking Account Review,33055,12,Citi,50063,4,"I've been a loyal Citibank customer for over 5 years. I have a checking account which connects to a debit card and several credit cards from Citibank. On the checking account, I have set up direct deposit with my employer. Citibank has never failed to deliver this deposit on time. I have used the debit card overseas and Citibank has one of the finest security systems. There were several occasions where I was immediately notified when I was using my card overseas upon instant transaction. Citibank's mobile and web functions are extremely easy to use and navigate. If there is one thing I wish Citibank could improve on is posting of pending transactions on checking accounts. There are times where the amount is deducted from the available balance but the pending transaction itself will not be posted until one or two business days later.",2018-05-04
2974,Citibank Money Market,33042,12,Citi,50050,4,"I have been using a Citibank Money Market account for some time now and it has been extremely useful for my day to day needs. I especially like that the account comes with check writing privileges. This came in handy when I needed to put a down payment on an apartment. I simply wrote a check from the money market account the same way that I would with my checking account. The benefit of the Citibank account is that the interest is better than my traditional checking account. I also have my money market account connected with my savings and checking account with Citt, which means that all of my banking records can be seen at a glance through their online Citi bank portal. All I have to do is log in and the site has all three of my accounts at a glance with easy access. Overall, everything has been pretty simple to use and understand from the web portal to the benefits of check writing.",2018-05-03
2975,Citibank CD,33035,12,Citi,50043,5,"Citibank has been one of the banks I have used for my certified deposit products. I have used it for about a year now and I am very satisfied. Since opening the account, they have been very helpful with all my questions and getting my account setup was quite easy. I did it online in about 20 minutes, though I did have to upload documents to prove my identity, this is normal in this industry. I think their rates could be a little higher to compete with other large banks, but I am satisfied with the current rates enough to keep my account long term. I am conservative with my money, so their CD product works well for me, knowing my money is safe while growing a little bit eat month.",2018-05-03
2976,Citibank is the Worlds Okayest Bank,33026,12,Citi,50034,4,"I have been using Citibank for 2 years now. I have had at least two bad experiences with customer service in those two years. Both times I had to call the help line, the employee was rude and non-helpful. However, that being said, the cool features (like the mobile deposit feature which I use almost exclusively these days as opposed to other methods of deposit) are worth banking there and even though I have had rude 'helpers' from Citi, at least they have the same (if not better) features as any other bank. The fees are pretty much in line with other banks... nothing special. The online services and interfaces are great. The one time I had a REAL problem (three charges to my account that were not me) they worked it out in a reasonable amount of time and didn't make me feel like a criminal, so that's a good mark for them. Overall, I am pretty much satisfied with Citibank and their services. (I have a Citibank credit card too).",2018-05-01
2977,Citibank Experiences,33024,12,Citi,50032,1,"I have banked with Citibank before. I hated them terrible customer service, extremely rude tellers. Hidden fees everywhere. Every single employee always acted like it was the worst day of their lives. It got so bad I finally decided to move my money elsewhere.",2018-05-01
2978,"Decent Experience, Annoying Website",33007,12,Citi,49973,3,"My experience with Citibank was mostly positive. I banked with them only for a short time while I was attending college. I never went in to the actual bank -- I just used their online interface and a debit card. I never had any big problems with the bank, and they never charged me any fees or anything like that. My only complaint would be there website. It had an unintuitive interface and I often had to try and remember the exact login procedure, because Googling always took me to the wrong login page. It seemed like they had different login pages for different services, which was irritating. I also had some issues connecting my account to Mint, which is very important for me because that's how I keep track of all of my budgeting and track my expenses over time. Overall I would say my experience was just fine, but they could improve with their web services.",2018-05-01
2979,An average experience with CitiBank,32999,12,Citi,49965,3,"I have been banking with Citi for about 3 years now. I have had a checking account the entire time. For the most part, it has always been very reliable. I can always look at my account online and easily see everything I need to. In a couple cases, they have had issues with transactions posting, and I have had to call them. The wait time on the phone is not the most ideal, but I am always greeted with a nice representative, who can help me with my issue. Their banking fees are about average and expected. Citibank has never done me wrong in any case. They have always worked their hardest to keep me happy and I appreciate that. I will continue using Citi in the future, because I have no reason to change. Overall, they are a very respectable bank and treat their customers well, and only have expected minor issues now and then.",2018-04-30
2980,Savings,32974,12,Citi,49939,3,"I have a great bank, but I heard some awesome reviews for there savings department. What interest me was they have a fantastic interest program, which you can make a good amount of money just saving! The bank was very busy when I showed up, but one of the newer reps offered me some coffee. I think its always a nice touch when they do that. I spoke to a very nice lady that really knew her stuff. Transaction went very smooth and she was able to set me up a savings account in",2018-04-27
2981,Average Big Bank that Met My Needs,32954,12,Citi,49913,3,"I established a checking/savings account with Citibank when I went away to college. My primary motivation was to have a large national bank that would have multiple ATMs in my new home that would make it easy to access my money. As an out-of-state student that was most important to me. The savings account was more of an afterthought and I just kept a minimum balance. I believe the interest rate paid on the accounts was minimal, but given the relatively small balances I had on deposit, even a higher rate would not have yielded me much. Overall, the bank met my requirements for accessibility. This also was of some benefit when I was travelling around the country either on vacation or on job interviews. Closing my account when I settled in to a permanent home was painless and the service I received while nothing special, certainly met my expectations for ease and professionalism.",2018-04-27
2982,Convenient Website,32944,12,Citi,49903,4,I have had a nice time banking with Citibank. Their website is easy to navigate and handle my money and online payments.,2018-04-25
2983,Citibank a terrible expiriance,32941,12,Citi,49900,3,"I banked with Citibank for about 3 years. They where ok for the first 2 years, but in the last year I decided to close my account with them because I had my account hacked 3 times in a row and each and every time Citibank made sure the experience was horrific excruciating painfully horrible. On one occasion they allowed someone to empty my account by processing about 50 transaction on the same day. Citibank never called me or notified me and they failed to recognize the transactions where suspicious so they allowed someone to empty my account. Then they actually made me speak to some sort of detective to declare my innocence before they would consider reimburse me for the money they allowed to be stolen. Citibank is a crap bank and no one should ever use them. They are beyond irresponsible. This type of event happened on two more occasions so I closed the account and moved to another bank.",2018-04-25
2984,"A timeless stalwart, but needs to get with the times",32929,12,Citi,49889,3,"Citibank is like that car you bought ten years ago that's still chugging along: reliable, sturdy, but sometimes you can't help but look at what the guy in the next lane is driving. The customer service is fast and helpful, especially once you get to the upper tier (read: higher bank balances). And the app feels fresh and new. But underpinning this glossy exterior are products that feel stale and outdated in 2018, particularly for millennials. Even as interest rates rise, you can expect to earn virtually nothing at all in return for giving Citibank the privilege of holding your assets -- even at the higher tiers. And in a world where Robinhood has made stock trading free for everyone, Citibank's nickel-and-dime fees seem truly archaic.",2018-04-24
2985,"Mediocre web experience, fees not clear",32908,12,Citi,49870,3,"I have a checking account with Citi and frequently use their website. The website experience for checking could be improved by making fees more visible. Instead of hidden away in footers and other pages on the website, the fees they are going to charge customers should be front and center on the main pages for your account. It seems like they are trying to hide very important things from customers. Also, the website seems to load slowly at times and I regularly get unavailable messages. The website could use larger fonts in headers. I'd like to be able to submit things in one click instead of multiple clicks. Just overall, make things clearer on the website and quicker to get done with essential tasks. When I need to do something I don't want to wait for the website to become available again.",2018-04-22
2986,Decent Service,32903,12,Citi,49865,4,"When I banked through Citibank I had a decent experience with them. The fees on some of their products were a little bit much and their online customer service was lacking a little bit so that's why I ended up switching to my local credit union. Overall, I probably would not recommend them to a friend because in my opinion there are a lot better banking options available that surpass Citibank.",2018-04-21
2987,Citibank is fine,32900,12,Citi,49862,4,"My experience with Citibank has been fine. I had a small savings account with them for a short while when I moved to town. I went in to deposit money in persona few times to the local branch and everything was pretty much fine. The teller I worked with was sort of stand-offish, she could have been more friendly. But most the time I use the website and app, and it is great. I like being able to check my balance and transfer funds on my phone wherever I am. I ended up moving to a different credit union because of my job, but I did really like the website of Citibank. It made me feel like I had more access to my accounts. It was especially good when I was traveling.",2018-04-21
2988,Mobile Banking Deposits,32876,12,Citi,49838,3,"I've been with Citibank for a few years now, primarily because it feels like such a total pain to switch to a new bank. I have had mostly positive experiences, but one area in which I think they could vastly improve is their mobile check deposit app. It's too much work to make sure the check fits within the defined parameters on the screen, and you wind up spending too much time fiddling with the placement on the screen in order for it to take a picture. You should just be able to take your own picture quickly, and then the app should be able to scale the check to its own parameters, rather than the other way around. It would just make mobile check depositing that much easier.",2018-04-20
2989,Citibank - a great International Banking Provider,32872,12,Citi,49834,4,"I am a professional who began looking at an international banking provider because I was sick of the international fees I was being charged when traveling. Since then, I have moved from Australia to the United States and furthered my relationship with Citibank to ease the cost of working in both countries simultaneously. I initially chose Citibank because of their customer service. Calling was simple - Yes, you can talk to a real person who is knowledgeable and considerate. Secondly, their website is easy to negotiate and simple to join. Their loans are diverse and reasonable. I didn't need to apply for any but I know they are there. Here is one big plus for this bank as opposed to many I have dealt with; they do not call you every second day trying to up sell their products. I am not a financial wizard and I want my bank to be honest, upfront, and not try to hide fees and sneak in new charges. I would recommend Citibank to anyone who has international needs and who want an institution that is easy to deal with but also has all the modern conveniences.",2018-04-19
2990,Good Bank,32867,12,Citi,49829,4,"I've been banking with Citibank for almost ten years. I have both a checking and savings account with this bank. They are well known in the Midwest and I have been depositing money and using them for banking for many years. The younger years I didn't know any differently and it was easily to deposit my checks into the accounts and use my debit card. As I got older and moved to the East coast I realized that I couldn't find many if any branches and so it became very hard to deposit checks with them so I had to turn to direct deposit. I have lost a card before had to call their customer service and there was a rather long wait and it was a pain to report it lost. They needed me to send them a copy of a police report and it seemed like a lot of work, but besides that issue I have been happy with them as a bank.",2018-04-19
2991,No Ridiculous Fees,32865,12,Citi,49827,3,"I've had a checking and savings account at Citi for years. They have numerous branches across the US and a presence in many of the global destinations I travel to most frequently on business. Their CD and Money Market interest rates are competitive with other institutions (which admittedly isn't saying much these days) and I've always had decent experiences when I've needed to interact with their Customer Service department. Unlike many major banks, they do not hammer you with ridiculous fees for every conceivable transaction. The mobile and web-based online banking utilities are nothing spectacular (compared to, say Wells Fargo) but they get the job done. Overall, I have been satisfied with the products and services provided by Citibank, and will most likely continue to do business with them in the future.",2018-04-18
2992,Citibank is the Best Among the Big Banks,32859,12,Citi,49820,4,I've had money on deposit with Citibank for over 10 years. In that time my experience working with Citibank has been positive and I can't think of a situation where Citibank customer service wasn't able to resolve the situation. They offer a wide variety of products with competitive rates which I find suitable to meet my banking needs. Along with a good customer service team they have a good amount of branch offices to meet my requirements both near my home and when I'm traveling. The Citi app for my Android phone makes it easy to find locations when I'm traveling or otherwise need to find a branch office. If I were to recommend a bank to anybody looking to open up a new checking or savings account I could recommend Citibank.,2018-04-17
2993,Citibank great for handling large transactions.,32855,12,Citi,49816,5,I had a bank account with Citibank some time ago. During the time I had that account I had to do a very large insurance transaction that my local bank refused to deal with. Citibank handled my transaction with no questions asked at all. They accepted the large electronic deposit and allowed me to distribute the fund to where I needed to be with an unlimited withdrawal amount per day and an unlimited amount of transactions per day which is exactly what I needed to get done what I needed to get done. They were so much easier to deal with than my local bank and they were so much more accepting of my situation. Even though there wasn't a physical branch near me they made everything as easy as possible.,2018-04-17
2994,No complaints,32846,12,Citi,49807,4,"I have been a member of citibank for 2 years and I have no complaints. Everything has been smooth so far an i have not had a bad experience yet. I appreciate the help they have given me when I was setting up the account, and I have no reason to have any issues with them. I am not sure if i am receiving the best services and price, because I have not banked with many other companies. I have noticed that I have received more cash back on purchases than I thought I would be. After only 2 years I have saved enough to buy a decent gift for myself or for my girlfriend. I have a credit card which I use on an almost daily basis on small items. I also like how there are many atms around my location. I don't have to travel far to get cash, so I plan on staying with citibank for a while.",2018-04-15
2995,Convenient online service,32844,12,Citi,49805,4,"I bank with Citibank and having my personal checking account, joint checking account, personal savings account and savings accounts for my kids. My paycheck is directly deposited into my personal account. I their website to transfer funds between accounts and pay bills. I use their mobile app to make check deposits. I find that both the regular website and the mobile good enough to rarely ever visit a branch. I am a long time customer and do not have experience using competitor products, so I am not sure if the web/mobile experience is better elsewhere. However, it works fine and I have not had any problems or issues using them. My only complaint is that I have indicated that if there is an issue with my account, I would like to be contacted by text or email. They will call me and I will usually ignore calls from generic 800 numbers. I wish they would contact me with my preferred method so that I may quickly address any areas of concern.",2018-04-15
2996,CitiBank is good but not great.,32840,12,Citi,49801,3,"I've banked with CitiBank for the last six months. The decision to change institutions came when I got engaged. We opened an account with citi while engaged and the name change process was a nightmare. Whereas with my other bank account at Chase all I needed to provide was my marriage cert and new ID, citi required more documentation and took far longer than needed to get stuff corrected.<br/> <br/>The fees themselves are standard. My checking doesn't accrue interest like my competitor bank account and there are requirements in order to keep the account free. The overall account experience is okay, not great. The customer service for my bank account is subpar though. Any issues or questions I have, I will call in and customer service can never give a direct answer to me and I wait on hold for a stupid amount of time. The only reason we haven't left Citi is because my credit card is with them and the credit card has great features I'm not willing to give up. <br/> <br/>Finding ATMs is also not the easiest. For that reason I think 3/5 stars is accurate. <br/> <br/>Overall, their products are standard and their customer service is decent but given the choice, I'd stay with larger banks like Chase where they actively monitor my account and are able to directly answer a question regarding my account.",2018-04-14

I made a mistake in a transfer between my credit card and checking account the other day and would have been charged a fee but when I called customer service they worked with me to refund the fee to my account and also get my transfer to the appropriate account. Also, when I walk into their branch, I am always helped immediately and made to feel like a valuable customer. I will be using CITI for many years to come.",2018-03-18
3001,An OK bank for the Common Consumer,31761,12,Citi,47827,3,This bank offers the average services for a bank and has been an overall pleasure to deal with. I have spoken with their phone representatives before for both losing my card once which they assisted with me very promptly and from weird purchases on my account. When I went away for vacation they quickly called me and made sure I was actually on vacation so as to verify my card was not stolen and I appreciated this a lot. Their mobile app could use some work however as it is clunky and laggy and that check deposit option can be buggy sometimes. But overall this bank has served its purpose to me. Another thing is their fees which can be a little overboard sometimes but that is also on me for not having enough money in the account at all times possible.,2018-02-15

My experience was near perfect with customer service. I have had it once where a transaction wasn't getting through. I gave CIT bank a call and didn't get put on hold and was able to get the issue fixed within 15 minutes. I have had the bank able to fix issues in minutes that any other bank would take at least 1 hour to fix. Overall their customer service is fantastic. It is an easy and clean experience on the web. They show everything on their website and it's easy to navigate. Best of all their fees. I hardly notice their fees due to how small they take absolutely brilliant of them.",2018-02-10

I also have withdraw funds from my local savings account into my citi checking account and usually they indicated that the funds will be credited into my account with in 5 to 7 days but l usually receive it in less than 48 hours.

3004,Checking account summary from Citi Bank,31349,12,Citi,47347,4,"I opened a checking account from Citibank about 5 years ago and it was a pretty smooth process. I liked that I didn't need to have a minimum opening deposit because my prior banks needed about 50-100 dollars minimum to even get started. I originally was with Bank of America and wanted a new bank because Bank of America's customer service was, and still is, pretty poor, in my opinion. Citi greatly improved my overall experience and I love that most banks are allowing mobile check deposits and other phone app features. I also think Citi offers some of the best rewards/perks for their customers and Citi Bank keeps on implementing most of the latest cutting edge features for both your phone/mobile app and your online interface experience.",2018-01-25

If you go into the branch and you need something they will make sure they get it for you.

That is why I don't have any credit card.",2018-01-19
3007,Citibank,30944,12,Citi,46484,3,I started using Citibank for my checkings and savings about 4 years ago and I am overall happy with it. I put a good amount into my checking so that I can have money that is liquids able and I can easily access and spend. I also have a savings CD that I do not have too much money into. It is kind of just a emergency fund because the CDS that they offer earn very low interest rates but have very low risk. I wish Citi offered higher rates with a little more risk but it is only a bank so I understand. I put most of my other savings into investment brokers so I can earn a higher rate on them and save for the future. I have a roth 401k at my other institution that is doing well and I am pleased with it.,2018-01-04
3008,Banking with Citi,30868,12,Citi,46407,4,I banked with CITI for about 3-5 years while my husband was working over the road. I loved the convenience of being able to use the card in many states as my husband was an over the road driver of our own trucking business. The one thing I looked at as both an inconvenience and an advantage was the company placing holds on the card when multiple purchases were happening in a day in different states. Lucky they would call me and let me verify that it was myself or my husband using the card in these purchases so they would go through but there was one time (the first time it was used) it did not and the card was placed on hold for 5 days. He was stuck over the road luckily with a spare card from another company that he was allowed to make a fuel purchase with. The professionals on the customer service line were very nice but there wasn't much they could do at their rank. Big inconvenience but we got through it. After that things were great. The card was used and transactions were approved at times of use. We did have to put on my file with them that it would be used in multiple states as my husband drives over the road so I think that helped.,2017-12-23

It has a clean (if somewhat dated) interface and all the functionality required. I have been able to conveniently transfer money in and out of the account and set up bill payments (for utilities and rent) without issue. The chat help feature has been helpful when I have had questions about upgrading my account for new features. I will be looking forward to when they are able to update their interface to something a little more modern with better user interface flow, but am in no hurry as it does what it is supposed to now.",2017-11-24

I decided to go with them as an adult with them due to the satisfaction that my parents always expressed. I decided to stay with them due to the exceptional customer service. The representatives at my location know me by name and make me feel more than welcome, I truly feel like a member there. The accounts that I hold have made me great returns on interest and I have never had any issues there at all. I would recommend this bank, and branch to anyone that was interested, without a doubt. For a short time I held a second account at a different bank and it gave me perspective on just how great Citibank treats their members. Citibank offers great accounts for children as well, I currently hold savings accounts for all three of my young children that are building great interest for their future. So not only has Citibank catered to my parents, and now me, they are catering to the third generation in my family. I suspect that will continue on down the line.",2017-11-11

I find that annoying, and its not just this bank, but most bigger banks these days. I have checking account and a credit card through them. I think they also offer loans at competitive interest rates compared to the rest of the industry. I have not had a loan through them, but I do check on the rates periodically.

Citibank customer service is better when it comes to helping customers over the phone than Wells Fargo was for me. They shipped me a new card out much faster when I lost mine last time. Also their mobile banking is easy to use and has more options of things to view on there without using the full site. I like that on Citi the amount you have to keep in your savings is low because sometimes I need to take money out but do not want to close my account.

However I can't say there's anything especially wonderful about them that stands out from other banks. It's a basic bank with solid account services and good customer service. I haven't had any problems but I haven't had anything amazing happen either. In general however I am happy with the service.

As technology has improved, Citibank has been quick to adapt. I was among the first in the United States to receive a secure debit card with a chip in it. Citibank was also one of the first to offer free mobile deposits for checking. Depositing checks on mobile devices is very quick, as it often posts the same day if I complete it in the morning. The wait time to get a hold of someone on the phone is usually very short. My only complaint about Citi is the cost of the checks. I go to a 3rd party vendor to save money on my checking costs. I do enjoy that the branch has hours on Saturday as most banks in my area do not.",2017-03-24
3021,Online Banking,26651,12,Citi,36678,4,Citi bank is a decent online banking experience. I opened a basic checking account with them and it took them about 2 weeks to send me my card and checkbook. Money that I transfer from other accounts is wired pretty quickly usually within 2 business days and is available for withdrawal. My account is easy to access and the mobile app is pretty efficient too. The mobile snapshot on the app is useful as well allowing me to see my balance without the hassle of logging in. So far I have used my account for both online and in store purchases with very little problems. I am overall very happy with this bank and will probably look into opening a savings account with them soon.,2017-02-17

They were so friendly and helpful and explained everything to me (and there was lots to explain to my 20 year old self). I am now 41 and still have the same checking account. Over the years, Citi has changed their policies and tried to assess fees just for keeping your money with them. Every time I went into a branch to complain, they reassured me that my account was grandfathered in and no fees would apply. One time, they showed me how to set up bill pay to avoid fees. And now I use PopMoney all the time. It's so easy to send money to people. I like Citi a lot.",2017-01-02

Transferring funds between my other accounts to this one or using these accounts at Citibank to pay bills has been very user friendly and I have not had an issue to date where I can fault them. There online service is easy to understand and they have a good directory of services to help you should you have any issues that can't be dealt with at that given time.

3024,The Worst Bank Ever! Your Money Is Unsafe With This Bank!,25581,12,Citi,34078,1,"The worst bank ever! Your money is unsafe with this bank. When you have a hard time and ask this bank help, they will make your situation even harder, and they will try to cheat you if they could. So don’t have any deals with this bank even if it close to your house. If you are already a customer, leave this bank as soon as possible before you get in a hard time and this bank will take advantage of you! I had an account in this bank for more than a year and this is what I’ve experienced. Someone took about $300 from my account in Japan without my card, so don’t be impressed that this bank says that we have secure cards. The account security is so weak that hackers don’t need you, not your card for grub money from your account in this bank. And security system is so stupid that it can’t figure out that if I pay with this card a few hours before in Miami I can’t be already in Japan. And after I reported this fraud to the bank, they said that they will investigate this problem and if all is OK I’ll get refund within 10 business days. It sounds like this is my problem that Citibank gave my money someone in Japan! And I guess I’m lucky that they didn’t take all my money because it would be hard to be without money for 10 business days! And they try to cheat you if they can! For example I pay nothing for use my debit card if I make at least one registered transaction, otherwise, I have to pay $10. So I created an auto payment for my phone so I didn’t worry about this. But in several months I saw that I was charged $10 as monthly payment. I contacted bank through chat but they said this is because your money was sent later, so it wasn’t in my cycle period and refused to refund me my money! Like this is my problem that this bank sent it later though the money was available on my account. It was the auto payment, so bank sent it itself! And only after I called in bank did they refund me the money. And the worst thing from this bank is that if you have a problem getting your money and ask Citibank to help you with this, they will make your time harder.  So my recommendation is to never have any deals with Citibank and if you already customer of Citibank leave it as soon as possible for you and your money safety!",2016-11-13

They leave customer service to handle all of the questions. You never get a firm answer.<br/><br/>Customer Service is excellent. I'm not sure about the branches though.

I have found this to be quite unique and am impressed with this available information. I have yet to take advantage of them to date but it is refreshing to know that I have options. I have not had any issues in regards to deposits or transfers and everything has been very satisfactory and in accord with what I would expect.

They are always eager to help you with your needs. and they are never in a rush. The website for Citibank is easy to navigate and use. Whenever I have had to call the 800 number for customer service they have also been as helpful and professional as going to the local branch.

They offered a great starter account that was joint savings and checking several years ago. I haven't wanted to change since and even had my husband join in the account. Unfortunately, interest rates overall (not specific to Citibank but general to almost all reputable banks currently) are so low, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to shift money into one of their other products such as a CD. However, my husband and I did look into this at one point and we had a live human being help us right away and lay out the terms and rates and answer all our questions very clearly. They have a lot of good literature and well-designed informational pamphlets in their branches. I recommend going into your local branch and checking them out and you can get a sense for yourself whether this is the right bank for you.",2016-06-29
3031,Review Of Banking With Citi By A Happy Customer,23649,12,Citi,29517,5,"I would say I have had a wonderful experience using CITI Bank. I especially enjoy the mobile app I have downloaded on my Android device. I can access up to seven years of statements and this was helpful when i was purchasing a home because the mortgage company requested several years of banking history. Also another big thing I've seen many banks offering is the mobile check deposit. I have sued this feature and I found that the app works great but I had issues while taking pictures of the front and back of my check. I kept getting errors and had to take many pictures before they were accepted by the app. I know on the commercials it looks so easy, and it should be easy, the app is set up quite easy, I feel this was just my camera and having bad lighting. The mobile check deposit didn't work or go as smoothly and quickly as I though it would. I do love their website as well as the mobile app as I feels it's user friendly and easy to maneuver and find anything i'm looking for on their website. I am lucky enough to have a credit card with them as well, so what's great about that is when i'm on my app I can click a button that says pay my credit card and it allows me to make my payment, without having to leave the screen or go to a new app or website. I have also set up notification one time when I paid my plumber a check I set up a notification for when he cashed it. I also set up a notification when my income tax was getting deposited. It's nice to be able to set up these updates especially when waiting for a check to clear. I have set up direct deposit and a auto pay to avoid the $12 monthly service fee. I do think the fee is higher than most banks but it's nice that I had the option to set up direct deposit and auto pay to avoid the fee. Another nice service they offer for customer like me with credit cards is I can ask them to reissue a credit card, or even activate a new credit card right through the mobile app on my phone. I love that they offer so many great things I can do with my phone. I feel this is the way of the future technology is everything, and Citi is definitely keeping up with the future of technology and all that they offer. I have recommended them to my friends and family more than once because I just love all the features I get right on my phone. I also like I was able to go paperless with my monthly statement so i don't have to worry if it got lost in the mail. Now I get an email every month, and there is a link in the email I click on that takes me right to my statement. I have email on my phone, so I did have to download an adobe reader app to my phone I found this out the hard way as the first time i tried to do it I couldn't get the statement to open. I love that I can access all this information right from my phone, and that I am helping save the environment because they're not cutting down trees to send me a monthly statement. They do offer many different types of checking accounts I just have the most basics but there are so many options especially if you're someone that keeps a higher balance, unfortunately I am not. The interest rate is pretty low only 0.01% so I'm not making much in interest but again I keep a pretty low balance, and they do have options for people that keep higher balances. All and all I would say my experience with their banking and their credit cards have been quite nice.",2016-04-13

We never have to rely on interacting with the bank representatives on a daily or even monthly basis. The online and mobile platform is clear, unambiguous, informative and good enough to carry out 95% of the day to day transactions. I have not felt a great deal of transparency in the life insurance plans that Citi offers along with its salary accounts, I haven't been able to see the total premiums paid, the accumulated interest and stuff, but when I raised the concern, the bank staff's were polite enough to send out the detailed statements, month-wise.

I have two other banks one is bank of america and the other is navy federal which is a credit union and not a bank. I have been with bank of american for about 2 years and compared to Citi, Citi is much better. I will start with the mobile app that Citi has. I never have any glitches when I use the citi mobile app, I always like that when I log into the citi app it tells me the last time I was on with the date and time stamp. I enjoy that it directs me to all my accounts without taking too long to load or having a glitch. When I pay my citi credit card bill the credit is almost instantly given back to me. The only one complaint that I would have is of course the customer service waits can be a bit long, however when I am greeted it is by a warm and friendly person. Another complaint I have is when I get gas on my credit card it can take up to two weeks for the final payment which I am not sure if that is the banks fault or the gas stations. The citi website is easy to navigate to and I even like how it has a nice layout. The fees are not bad at all compared to bank of america and I also have a credit card that I do not have any interest till 2017 and I have a larger credit limit.

3039,Transfer From Another Credit Card,12564,12,Citi,11890,1,"To put my feelings into the vernacular, this bank SUCKS.  I have now notified my representative (who is ourSpeaker of the House) the attorney general of the state of OH, and am working on various banking associations.  What CITI is doing is simply illegal.  This came to my attention about 6 months ago when CITI bgan a relentless calling campaign to me.  The deal was that Icould transfer any amount of money from another credit card or simply call it an INTEREST FREE LOAN for 13months.  I pay in full each month and have an excellent credit rating and history but I am not stupid either.  13 months of using money free was not a bad deal and up front costs were minimal-maybe $300 for a $10K transfer.  Again--no interest.  however, when I received my next month's statement (which I pay in full to avoid any interest,)I see a $50 interest charge.  I called (Bangladesh or India) and said--""WHOA- I paid for all of my charges in full, on time, and added $1000 in order to begin the elimination of the free $10K.""  I was told the interest charge was an error.  next month, same thing. and then the third time,  I went thru channels and got a CITI BANKER who explained CITI takes your payments and applies it to the outstanding (interest free) amount FIRST, and then with the remainder charges interest, so this 3rd time, my interest was $3. since then I have stopped using my CITICARD totally..The point is:  THEY CHARGE INTEREST TWICE:  FIRST ON THE AMOUNT THEY SO ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRANSFER, then THEY CHARGED A SERVICE FEE FOR DOING SO, and THEN THEY CHARGE INTEREST AGAIN ON THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL WHICH would mean a monthly payment EVEN IF you don't charge anything.  AND TO THINK I DID THIS TO GET 10,000 MILES ON AMERICAN.  ok, I am stupid.  But this is illegal",2013-02-12
3040,Horrible Web Design Of Citibank Business Site,12386,12,Citi,11667,1,"I have personal accounts with Citibank. I like their website okay. Some features are helpful, like the expense categorizer tool. And I often use the e-bill payment option, which I assume is standard with all banks. I also like that I can nickname my accounts so I don't have to remember which account is which.<br/><br/> Now, I just opened a Citi business account and after going through all the extra security measures to sign on with a token at www.citibusinessonline.com, I was taken aback at how crappy the look and feel of the Citi business user interface is. It looks like a grade school project. There is hyperlinked text for everything, no graphical buttons. It takes about 4 clicks just to get to see your account's transactions. 4 clicks!! On the personal Citibank site, you sign in and you get presented with an overview of all your accounts right from the get go. But the business online experience is a totally different animal. It looks like it was done in the 90s and then never updated again (It still uses frames, which are no longer supported in HTML5).<br/><br/> I called the Citibank Business department and very politely let them know that I feel I've been suckered into using Citibank for my business needs because they sell you on the regular Citibank website that has all the bells and whistles. I spoke to a supervisor and he spoke to a level 2 guy, but at the end it was just ""thank you for letting us know.""<br/><br/> The sad part is that I get charged $20/m for the business account (my personal accounts are free). For what? For a lousy, half-assed online experience? Citibank pays its CEO millions of dollars but it can't even allocate the funds to get a web development/design team together that replicates or improves upon the personal Citibank website?

I tried and tried to make payments on my account by the deadline and their electronic check hotline would always say that they accepted the payment and three or four days later it would be returned.

Finally I would get a manager who would be able to assist me and not have to speak off a script and yet not all my questions would be answered. <br/><br/> I have tried 4 more times between calling and than be redirected back into their electronic check hotline to by a representative because I said I did not want to be charged the $14.95 fee for having a representative assist me with payment.

Yet their system wouldn't accept payment. <br/><br/> After playing this game for about 5 rounds... I got a representative who directed me to their website to make an online payment. At this time, I am thinking.. ""Awesome! I can pay off my $1100 remaining balance!"" Unfortately it would not allow me access to make an online payment but then direct me to speak with a representative again. <br/><br/> How in the world is a card holder suppose to make a payment if the customer service/billing will  not accept payment without adding another fee onto the account. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/> I have found thier games to be ridiculous! Frustrating and right now mad hatter style. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/> STAY AWAKE! FAR FAR AWAY! GO WITH ANOTHER COMPANY FOR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING EVEN IF THEY HAVE HIGHER INTEREST RATES! <br/><br/>  <br/><br/> I bet you would get better customer service and assistance with any of your banking needs! ",2012-11-07
3042,Horrible Bank!!!,8289,12,Citi,6664,1,"I will start by saying, i would give zero stars if i could. This is the worst bank with the worst customer service, down at the bottom of the list along with BOA. Dont even think about joining Citi unless you want to here that there is nothing they can do at the moment. I have beenput up with Citibank for 6 years and I am done. Chase bank is now 1 person greater. I posted a recent conversation i had with a rep so see for yourself. They dont even know the answer so they feed you crap.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/> Moises: Welcome to Citibank's Online Chat. My name is Moises. It is an honor to assist you today!<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Thank you, I am online to view my bank statements from Feb 2011 to October 2011 and i requested them yesterday. It then stated they would be available the next day and they are not. Can you help me?<br/><br/> Moises: I am sorry to hear that. I will be happy to assist you.<br/><br/> Moises: Did you go to the account section?<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Account section then statements<br/><br/> Moises: Correct.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Yes, and they are not available.<br/><br/> Moises: Does it have a Message saying why><br/><br/> Moises: ?<br/><br/> YEZENIA: No it simply shows the statements that are available which i already downloaded however the ones that i need are now telling me, once again, that they will be available the following day, tomorrow<br/><br/> Moises: I am sorry about that, you can request form them again, I can also do it for you however we will have to wait for them either way. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Okay, well I need them today which is why was happy that it said yesterday that they would be available the next day. What other way am i able to request them because if the message stated when I would receive them then your company must follow the information given to me.<br/><br/> Moises: I am sorry if they are more than 90 days old there is a 24 waiting period on either end.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Okay and does your message state that? No. The message stated that following: ordered for next business day. With that said they should be accessible at this point.<br/><br/> Moises: It is possible that the system had a glitch and the statements were lost. I apologize about this inconvenience. They would have to be reordered.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: If i did not need them i wouldn't mind wwaiting another day, but when I am told something by a company then I expect it to be done as said. A glitch is not my problem, that fault is on citi. I need my statements as i said when i was told they would be available which is today.<br/><br/> Moises: I am sorry about that. I can request that they be mailed out to you as soon as possible. I can waive the shipping fee.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Do you realize that mailing something takes a longer process? There must be a way for them to be emailed or faxed over even if it is not your protocol to do so. There was an error on your company's end and i should be provided with my request by your company in any way possible if your ccompany cares.<br/><br/> Moises: What time did you order the statements?<br/><br/> Moises: If the order was placed after 8 ET it will take longer since it was past the cut off time.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: I am not sure of the exact time, after 5:30 PM PST, so most likely around 6PM.<br/><br/> Moises: 8PM<br/><br/> Moises: That is 830 PM ET<br/><br/> Moises: The statements will be available for you to view by tomorrow.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Okay, now where on your page does it state that?<br/><br/> Moises: When you place the action it is stated on the fine print at the bottom of the conformation window.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: NO, there is no fineprint except terms and conditions, I read fine print if it is available and its not. I actually just requested it again just to make sure so the statement you just made to me is false.<br/><br/> Moises: I am sorry about that. I know changes have been made to the site. I have looked up the cut off time in our systems and the cut off time is 8PM ET.<br/><br/> Moises: The statement will be available tomorrow. If you requested it again just now it will not be available until Monday. Saturday and Sunday are Non Working Business days.<br/><br/> Moises: When you send a request some ones has to go and physically pull the files up. They leave at 7pm CT 8pm ET.<br/><br/> Moises: If the order was placed after that time they will not get the request until the next day Thursday, making it available on Friday.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: and that is my problem that changes have been made? It did not say it yesterday either so like i said before that is your company's fault. There is a very basic statement given which i already told you about and i simply want what is rightfully mine. My request was made and a response was given so I expect it to be completed as i was told.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Im sure there are plenty of supervisors working with you, or at least someone with enough common sence to know how to pull up files and send them to me.<br/><br/> Moises: We can not pull them up.<br/><br/> Moises: Not even a supervisor.<br/><br/> Moises: The statements will be available to view tomorrow.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: So what is the point of your supervisors? To litterally watch their employees of citi bank tell their customers tat there is nothing else you can do? I have heard that plenty of times from your company. I want my files that i was told would be available today.<br/><br/> Moises: Some one has to pull them out of the archives. That takes 24 hours. Today the order was processed and will be fulfilled by displaying them by tomorrow.<br/><br/> Moises: The order was placed after the cut off time.<br/><br/> Moises: It is out of our hands.<br/><br/> Moises: It was just processed today and will be delivered by tomorrow.<br/><br/> Moises: They will be available by 6 am ET.<br/><br/> Moises: That would be 3 am your time.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: You just stated earlier: Moises: The statement will be available tomorrow. If you requested it again just now it will not be available until Monday. Saturday and Sunday are Non Working Business days. and you knowing i just requested it again are telling me tomorrow? I feel that you have no knowledge of what you are even saying.<br/><br/> Moises: The original request is still going to be fulfilled. They will be delivered tomorrow. The statements requested only have a 1 day life span after that they are deleted. The second request will be fulfilled by Monday if you do not check them by tomorrow.<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Whatever, I am not going to keep trying to get them from you, apparently they hire the best people full of crap to tell their customers, just like the phone reps do when i have called about issues with my account. Thanks for wasting my time and have fun getting paid to tell everyone that you cant assist them.<br/><br/> Moises: I am sorry you feel that way. They will be there tomorrow. Can I help you with anything else?<br/><br/> YEZENIA: Yes, let your supervisor know that this chat will be posted on your reviews so everyone thinking about joining citibank will think again.",2012-03-01
3043,Hands Down Worst Bank Ever. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.,7813,12,Citi,661,1,"This is by far the WORST BANK that I have ever encountered. I had a mortgage with them, but could not pay it online unless I had a bank account. So I signed up for a savings and checking account. Then I get a notice that I will be charged a $20 monthly service fee, if I don't transfer $15,000 into my account. So I called to cancel my accounts. The Citibank rep told me that if I cancelled my checking and left the savings open I would not be charged. Not so. I was charged $40 in service fees. When I called to try and remedy the situation, I was stonewalled. When I asked for a manager, I was transferred to the call center for Chinese speaking customers. I was finally told that it did not matter that a Citibank rep lied to me. They will not credit my account back the money. The reason why, ""because."" WOW. I had records of the calls and everything they just don't care. They just wanted their $40. I am sure it was a very important $40. I would worry about their stability as a bank if that is the case.

Instead, I had to have a minimum of $6000 monthly balance to receive free checking. I am sorry, I am not rich, I make 6000 every 2-3 months. I do what I can a month then they want to take another $7.50 from me because I don't have a lot of money.

Plus, I find that everytime I call customer service reps, even for more banking questions and issues, are outsourced to India. They do not help.

3057,Worst Bank Experience Ever,37346,77,US Bank,59063,1,"Probably the worst experience I have ever had with a bank. My partners and I decided to use them for our small business account. It seemed to start out ok until we found out they had not set up our account correctly. We were having issues every time we issued a check the return address either would show a personal address with the company name or a personal name with the company address. I called multiple times and they kept telling me to not log into a personal account. But we were logging into the business account and sending the check directly from there. Finally, after multiple calls one person was smart enough to look further into it and realize it was an error on their part and it was corrected.<br/>Next, we wanted to wire transfer money to our attorney in Mexico. We told them how many pesos we need to send them. Instead of converting the pesos to US dollars and taking that out of our account they sent the pesos equivalent but as US currency numbers. So basically, sent way more than needed. We noticed the error and told them. They acted as if they didn’t know what to do and couldn’t get the funds back. We warned them after months that the attorney at some point will have to claim it and be taxed on it. They continued to act as if they couldn’t do anything and told us to start trying figure their mistake on our end.<br/>Eventually they were unable to obtain the funds after waiting too long. The local manager threatened us by telling us if we didn’t return the money someone would get fired at US Bank for their screw up. We are a startup company and aren’t even paying ourselves so not sure what we could do about it.<br/>The manager doesn’t answer her phone or return her voicemails and is never in the office so not sure what she does. They just recently took the money back out of our account. We are talking about $5k which is peanuts to them, and it was their screw up. <br/>I know all banks have their good and bad, but I was blown away on how bad they are. Needless to say, we are moving on from them so just error on caution when looking to do business with them.",2019-05-21
3058,New Customer Experience Was Disastrous,36917,77,US Bank,57687,1,"I opened an account for my nonprofit about 6 weeks ago, and it has been a complete nightmare from end to end. The only bright spot is the staff at this branch, who were lovely, but can't overcome the disaster that is US Bank. When I opened the account (at the branch), it took a while, and rather than keep them past closing time, I told them they could just send me my debit card and PIN, which I didn't want anyway. What they apparently didn't know was that without a PIN, you can't set up your online account or anything else, as it is core to their security protocols. When the password I was given for the online account didn't work, I was stuck. After many phone calls trying to get that straightened out, I gave up and waited for the PIN to arrive. Then it didn't work. More calls, more snail mail, finally got a PIN that worked. <br/><br/>Then began the saga of trying to get my nonprofit accountant set up for shared access to my account. Turns out US Bank had just released an updated web process for that, and it didn't actually work (and they acknowledged this). Apparently they don't actually test features before releasing them. Six times I had to register her for access, then discover that the system had messed up, then unregister her. Many, many hours spent with Customer Service. Finally, after several weeks, my accountant was able to log in to my account, only to discover that she did not have access to my bank statements. I called Customer Service again to discover that US Bank does not include bank statements in shared access. They allow access to all individual transactions, but not to statements! No one could explain this idiotic policy. So that was the last straw for me. I'm closing the account and looking elsewhere.",2019-04-09

Set up online account and log in. <br/><br/>Two days later their IVR system called & said I still needed to activate! What? Transferred me their customer service & said I could only activate if I had the card in my possession or I would have to call back later. <br/><br/>Figured that since I was on the line I would confirm my promotion offer. Then was told the promotional offer that was mailed to me with a confirmation code that I used to sign up for the card online was NOT in their system! What? They actually then said I only had the options to snail mail or fax my offer in to get my offer applied! What-who faxes anything anymore? No option to scan and e-mail like a normal CC company-it was stated that they can't receive ""outside"" e-mails which is a complete lie. Escalated 2 levels and that manager would not escalate any further. I asked her if she just wanted me to cancel the card right now since this was my first experience with US Bank ever and she said no but would do NOTHING to even apply one iota of basic customer service. No work arounds, no credits for their mistakes-the onus was on ME for THEIR errors-she was utterly rude.<br/><br/>Further, setting up your online account is arduous-it took almost 15 mins. of step after step after step-other cards I have took less than 5 mins. And they don't even have an outgoing messaging options or a chat option. While their staff is in the US and not offshore, frankly I came away with the conclusion that I was working with a 3rd World based company.<br/><br/>I can't believe the horrible customer service and rigidity of their processes.

3060,HORRIBLE THIEVES,35950,77,US Bank,54945,1,"I am a permanently disabled senior, I put 6 - 100 dollars in Reno main branch drive up machine on Friday afternoon but after several seconds it displayed error with making deposit, but I thought it would return my bills but it did NOT return my money ... instead gave me long receipt with a phone number to call claiming the machine error'ed. I immediately pulled over and called spoke to a very nice lady where she explained it might get credited during that nights processing. So I agreed to wait until Sat morning to see if it got credited and then file a claim like she suggested. She spoke about provisional credit, putting a special notation, she offered to contact branch mgr but since it was Friday they may not be available, she was very nice but I felt confident processing would surely count (simple addition (money in) subtraction, (money out) & catch the error see that machine was over 600.00 so I went home. Sat I call the number again. I got a man whose name was Kaiser .. he was horrible, he spoke so monotone and cold, even rude. Put me on hold, got back on and after he said he filed a claim he then told me it would take longer than 10 days - I said NO. I can't even wait 10 days, its X-mas and I live on $1,400 a month. He was extremely non compassionate, clearly he didn't care, he wouldn't even let me wait on hold for a supervisor. Told him I live on Social Security, it is 3 days before X-mas, I can't even and shouldn't even wait 10 days but now he is telling me legally it could take longer? I said NO about 5 times and asked for his supervisor. He truly didn't care, I asked for his supervisor 10 more times, didn't want to listen to him any longer and then he said he was going to disconnect me, told me I couldn't remain on hold that all his supervisors were helping other callers. He said I couldn't remain on hold that he had other callers he needed to take - again that all his supervisors were busy (what does that tell you), this is a special call center not main U.S. BANK number and if they have that many callers, supervisors can't take new callers they are so busy, how many other U.S. bank customers are being cheated out of their money. Crying - feeling sick I told him I get poor reception, live in a valley cannot get calls sometimes, I did not want someone calling me back, I wanted to remain on hold to speak to a supervisor. He again said NO. I have NEVER had a company treat someone who has been victimized or had their money stolen treat them like this. He said NO I cannot remain on hold, again telling me he had to take other callers like my time was not important or a concern. I got dressed to personally go down to the main branch, got online, main branch closed on Sat so Monday being the day before X-mas will go down there then. HORRIBLE BANK always has been and getting worse each year. Been with them over 10 years. NO ONE holds them accountable, yeah gov will say there are banking regulations but those regulations do NOT hold people accountable to deter this type of HORRIBLE treatment, stealing people's money, no concern. Other friends and relatives have had problems. One stopped using debit card because a company was deducting money and a year later, new card U.S. bank allowed this same bad off shore company to deduct small amounts from their account without their permission. Once before this bank had a processing person supposedly steal large amount from a machine envelope deposit, later manager said they found the error/money but customer had to get returned checks, and amounts charged to customer reversed. My advocate advice, to ANY ONE is ...... DO NOT do business with this bank, there are other NICE banks, smaller local ones even credit unions that WILL treat you like a valued customer, not misuse or steal money from you. I know, MY FAULT for continuing to use them, opened a different account with a very nice bank. Wrote to Minneapolis several times years before with Aunt's account, they don't care.

The following day I was back at the DOR, called again with speaker on and the agent sitting there. A different nasty lady started to tell me how it was the DOR's fault. Thankfully, the agent stepped in, told her what was what, and even faxed her the documents. After hanging up, he looking at me and said "" wow, you need to get a different bank"". Good advice.

I wasn't sure I even wanted to do it, but because one of my bills gave me a discount for doing electronic funds transfer to pay it, I became interested in learning more. The whole experience of banking online soon became easy. It was nice to look up information about my checking account without having to call in and wait on hold for a long time. I found it was easier to keep track of expenses and find errors quicker than waiting for paper statements to come out. So I tried my hand at beginning an automatic payment that didn't have to be done that way, just for convenience. I now have several bills I regularly pay that way and it works very nicely.",2018-05-23
3065,Horrible Bank,33695,77,US Bank,50394,1,Horrible bank. The checking account was the worst I ever seen. I tried to deposit a check... Nope 200$ daily limit. My check was just for $205!!! Like a fool I applied for their credit card cause of the 150$ bonus and got a useless $500 card with a 760 FICO.... When I applied for a cli 3 months later got denied and had my TU pulled 2 times just 1 day in between!!! I'm just going to close it too. What am I suppose to do with a $500 card? I got multiple cards with 10k+ limits on my report. Why not at least give me 2000 or something reasonable? Nope looks like this bank is on par with Credit One... To be avoided!!!,2018-05-05

If you don't want to be confused with your money, I highly suggest not using their mobile website, it just basically the desktop version, but a lot worse and very glitchy, from time to time my bank statement reads differently and it feels like they are accessing my money from afar, you don't want that, you want maximum security for your money. Overall, for almost three years being associated with this bank, no problems yet, just a very ugly mobile site, up until now. I would still recommend this particular bank since you can avoid its main flaw. Note, all my savings are in account with them, and its all fine up until now.",2018-04-29

This bank was the first online banking I had ever done, so I had to learn how. Thankfully, their customer service department has always helped me figure out what was wrong when something didn't go right. The biggest issue I've had is when they have updated their system in the past, the online banking sometimes didn't work. On three separate occasions over several years, I was on the phone with technical support trying to solve the issue, and found out it wasn't working with a specific browser. I had to use Internet Explorer for awhile and then eventually it starting working with other browsers like Chrome. Since this has happened so many times, I now know to try another browser before calling for help if I ever have issues. <br/> <br/>I generally like the online experience. There used to be a section on the left side where you can click a link that says ""Pay Bills."" It allowed you to pay a single bill quickly and easily. But it you wanted to pay a bunch of them, like I usually do, you had to click a link that indicated you could go to the regular Pay Bills page, but you actually had to click it twice. Now they have a link that says ""Pay External Bills"" and that takes you directly there.<br/> <br/>Overall I am satisfied with the experience. I use the automatic bill pay feature a lot and have figured out how to get around in the system.",2018-04-16

The bank assessed me a $36.00 overdraft charge, then continued to charge me $25.00 every seven days for a continuing overdraft condition, and never informed me that I was overdrawn. By the time I realized I was overdrawn, they had assessed me a total of $219.00. When I asked them why they had not called or emailed me that I had a problem, they said they would have sent me a letter at the end of the month. This is not banking, this is larceny.",2018-01-19

US Bank charges me od fees for transfers between my own accounts! I'm loosing money not because of insufficient funds but for misallocation of funds between accounts. Their website did not offer any suitable solutions. So I took the time to go speak with local banker only to receive a lecture how my business is a burden to them as they have to physically call another state for completion (moved from another state where I originally set up the accounts), how mine were just a few of hundreds of thousands of accounts and I have no idea how having multiple accounts compounded their burden. I held my patience and calmly suggested that the unnecessary od fees are making my banking costs at US Bank prohibitive and I'd be left with no choice but shop around otherwise to which the banker encouraged me to go ahead. With their blessings (not that I needed it) I looked around and now on what appears to be a happier path. It's nothing to them of course as I'm no millionaire but moving on is chicken soup for my spirits. Moral? don't let loyalty enslave you.",2017-12-05

They are definitely a very relationship-orientated bank, and the more you use them, the more generous they seem to be. I like that if you have good credit, you can get the Gold checking fees waived with the ""Because You Earned It"" program. Customer service has always been pretty decent, and the couple times I actually had to go into the branch were positive experiences. I'm also very happy they finally ditched the fee for mobile deposits! I also have the Altitude Reserve card which I've been pleasantly surprised with. The 3x points on mobile purchases is great - as long as I remember to pay with my phone!<br/><br/>The only real negatives I've found with them so far is that like most banks, the interest rates are pretty terrible.

Also the customer service is quite slow sometimes getting back to me regarding questions I have with my account. The application on my phone to access my account has a verification process that can cause delays when I have very minimal time to check at work. Overall I would say the online banking is okay but could use many improvements in regards to convenience.

US bank makes it easy for me to check what is going on with my account through my phone. There is an app they have that you can download to you phone that allows you to seeing all your banking needs in real time. At first I was a little hesitant, but their security system is very efficient. If you have an iphone 7 you can us you fingerprint to login to your account. I prefer to have a password as well so to get into my account I must use my finger print password, put in my password, and confirm the password screen has the picture and noises I choose every time I login. This I believe is a great example of technological security. The app also allows you to transfer from checkings to savings (etc), make a check deposit (they do charge .50, but it still beats gas prices), and see a detailed report of your spending. Using it on my phone has been a great asset and I can honestly say is one of the reasons I am debt free today.",2017-09-18

I also have auto-payments set up for my other accounts with them and direct deposit of my paycheck into my checking account. I use that account and the debit card they give me to make other purchases and payments online. I once had an issue where my card number was stolen and used, but they were very quick to identify the fraud and contacted me before I even knew it had occurred.

Recently, I got aa message telling me if I change the type account I have, I can reduce the minimum balance requirement for no fee on my checking account.

I've maintained a checking account with direct deposit through US Bank since I was 16 and working my first summer job. The thing I like about this bank is if you have scheduled direct deposits, they waive administrative fees on your accounts. Ordering checks is a bit of a hassle, and they tend to run 7 - 15 dollars a booklet, but the advent of mobile banking has made this a non issue for the most part. Their mobile banking app works well enough on my phone but could use some upgrades to do things like cancel automatic payments when your balance is less than the amount of the autopay - which currently doesn't work.

At first, I just went with them because it is basically the first local one I found that does not charge monthly fees for checking and savings accounts. They have always been pretty good to me but have recently updated to suite customers needs better. Example one, they walked me through linking checking account to a credit card that way if I ever had something bounce it would go onto the credit card instead of charging you an overdraft fee and leaving you with nothing. Also one thing that they updated is how quickly they release your funds. Before they would only instantly release funds for paychecks and everything else would take several days til the money was available.

My only complaint is that there is no real money market option that pays a decent interest rate. Also, there are no decent CDs that pay good interest. I have a paperless option so I don't receive statements in the mail. I get email notification when my statement is available. I download the statements and keep them on my cloud storage.

Eventually he began to help me with the process of opening a new account. While he reviewed my identification card and other paperwork I needed to give him, I was told it was not wise to bank with them as he believed I didn't have ""enough"" money to cover the monthly maintenance fees. I was surprised, because I never heard of a bank rejecting a new customer for that reason. It wasn't his business to tell me that and the only job he had to do was open the account, and let me worry if I didn't have money to keep my account open and in the positive. I was appalled and left the place angry. I eventually did sign up online with no issues and the person who helped me was very efficient and did their duties as an employee.

Some locations actually are open on Sundays and have extended hours until 7:00 PM making doing banking business extremely convenient. My experience with in person tellers/bankers have been posisible. I'm met with a smile, they acknowledge my children and exchange pleasantries while doing our interaction. The draw backs for me as a consumer would be when needing to call in for customer care assistance or being directed to the call center for assistance. Reps are usually rude and the wait time to even get to a rep is astronomical. I've not been able to get anyone to be able to successfully help me regain access to my online account in the last year. I've literally given up because I've spent so much time trying to get it corrected.

While not quite as bad as Bank of America or Wells Fargo, some of the fees are still ridiculous and not very understandable. Why should I spend $3 to get a cashier's check with my money on it? That doesn't make any sense. The nickel-and-diming continues if you just want temporary checks ($1.50 per transaction) and just getting any checks is such a hassle unless you have a Platinum account. A Platinum account requires that you have $25,000 minimum, and I couldn't justify putting that much money into a bank account without having to invest in it first. Their investment banking is very disorganized and they never got back to me. However, as I mentioned, the service is really good, I enjoy the convenience, and their ATMs are really nice.

A 10% interest rate, basically, for one year. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>They also offer a good overdraft fee schedule. If you are overdrawn by only a couple of dollars, they do not charge a fee (as I have found out). They reversed the first overdrawn charge I had automatically without me requesting it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>I have been impressed with the customer service at their branches.

When I was at the bank closing the account the charge wasn’t mentioned. <br/><br/> Here is the explanation of the charge that I got after inquiring about it via e-mail:<br/><br/> “Thank you for contacting US Bank and for allowing us the pleasure of assisting you. <br/> <br/> I appreciate this opportunity to address your inquiry. Our records show you closed your account before the end of the statement cycle. Please understand that the reversal in the amount of $16.76 was a reversal of interest earned for the previous cycle due to the accounts closure.” <br/><br/> That’s US. Bank!",2013-07-24
3103,Usbank - The Worst Experience With A Bank EVER,13138,77,US Bank,12612,1,"I have NEVER had a bad experience with a bank until now.  I have a credit score of 815, I have $441,000 in equity in my home, I have a job.  My local banks routinely sell mortgages to USbank so I went to them first to borrow $100,000 in December of 2012.  I worked with four different people - all of whom told me I had conditional approval on the loan.  On March 28 - nearly FOUR MONTHS after we started this process and paid them an application fee, they denied the loan.  I honestly think they denied it because I told them to either fund the loan or tell me they weren't because after 4 months I need to move on.  Their reason - my income this year was lower than my income last year.  No kidding, I'm in sales, my income fluctuates - but it took them 4 months to figure that out.   NOT ONE TIME did any of these USBank employees return a call when THEY SAID THEY WOULD.  I had to chase them down for every conversation we had.  Unfortunately, they have my current mortgage but I started today to rectify that situation.  Arrogant employees.",2013-03-29
3104,US BANK IS GREAT,12622,77,US Bank,11970,5,"I really have no idea what all you people are feaking out about. Actually, I think I might. I have worked in the banking industry for 17 years, and have worked for many different companies. And just to make things clear, I have never worked for US BANK, so this is not a bias report.  It is sad to say that the customer service I received from other companies I worked for is terrible in comparison to the service I have received from the bankers at US BANK! I have been a member for about 3 years, and I usually go to the branch inside smiths grocery store, in Sunset Utah. They are amazing. There has been some employee turn over throughout the last couple years, but the service is still great. I am blown away that they know my name EVERY TIME I go in. Even the bankers that are new to the branch, learn my name and my ""habits"" very fast.  As far as the person that was complaining about the banker showing up to work sick! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?! Do you even know what their schedules are like? Probably not. Banks, well at least the ones inside grocery store, do not have 30 employees that they can just call up to cover if someone is sick. I applaud them for being grown up enough to tough it out. (As long as he/she was washing their hands! :-)  Having worked in the sales/service industry my whole life, I understand that there are people thst just have to find something to complain about, and that's what it sounds like is going on here. I have had a couple frustrations with US BANK, but not enough to complain like a child. I realize that they are human, and the make mistakes. I have made plenty in my lifetime. So for those of you that obviously believe you are perfect, and that everyone should bow down to you and wait on you hand and foot, and do whatever you ask of them, then maybe US BANK is not the place for you. But on that note, I don't think you will be happy anywhere! US BANK  is amazing. They are so great that I closed my account that I had with my previous employer for 12 years and moved over to  US BANK. I refinanced my mortgage with US BANK, I opened a CD with US BANK. Sometimes I make a stop by the bank when I am grocery shopping, just to say hi to my bankers. US BANK IS THE BEST!!",2013-02-18
3105,Should Be Zero Stars,12576,77,US Bank,11911,1,I find it interesting that almost all the reviews are 1 star except for the peppering of 5 stars. Most likely US Bank PR people trying to make their bank look better then it is. We have a boat loan through them and they are beyond horrible!!!! Hardly ever post a payment correctly. Forget trying to pay down principal...they refuse to do it. They call the house if the payment has not been received on the due date. Never mind we have FICO scores over 800 are in our 50s and never paid one creditor late EVER! They could care less if there is a grace period. Callers/collectors are beyond rude and condescending. We have never been treated like this....ever! Steer clear of this place. A loan shark would have been more pleasant to deal with.,2013-02-13

I tried to set up an account to transfer money to a friend of mine who needs it by today. Should be simple, but then they asked me for this random activation code that you have to call into their office to reiceve. It gives you a phone number next to where you need to input the activation code, but the phone number goes to their general business line, so after waiting for someone to get to me, they have to transfer me and I have to wait there for someone to get to me. After getting the activation code, be sure to enter it in perfectly the first time because if you don't or if you mistake the activation code for a different number (like the cvvr code on you card) you'll be kicked from the site and will have to wait a whole 24 hours to call them back and get another stupid code because the activation code expires. <br/><br/> Assuming a human might have the ability to speed this process up, I called them back, had to hold, was transfered, had to hold, was transfered again, told specifically, ""Oh, this is above my pay grade"", transfered again, and then finally told, ""We have no control of that 24 hour time period. There is nothing we can do, you have to wait.""<br/><br/> I have to wait? It's a computer, there should be some way for someone to override the system like any normal computer so that I can get what I need without waiting 24 damn hours. <br/><br/> This was the final straw.

3108,Customer Service,11229,77,US Bank,10343,2,"Here is what happened:<br/><br/>I went to Europe over the summer. My card was also locked two weeks before I returned home after making an online purchase from SLP Performance. (I wanted the parts to be shipped to my house and waiting when I got there). After getting back I called and had it unlocked. No problems, they verified who I was and unlocked it. Two days later My card is locked again.<br/><br/>Going online to ""Online Banking"" I verify that there is in fact money in the account. While I was online checking this I noticed that I was receiving ""Maintenance Fees"". <br/><br/>While I was away I stopped receiving direct deposit from work into my checking account. (No work, no pay) For a Gold Package Account you need to receive $100 electronic deposit every month to waive service fees. (I had a ""Gold Package"")<br/><br/>I called Customer Service and got the Fees Waived and the card unlocked. While on the phone the customer service representative told me I should switch to a student account to avoid fees in the future. I told her I was O.K. with the account I had. She went on to explain what a benefit a Student Account would be to a student.<br/><br/>After several minutes of her persuasion and reassurances that there would be no more fees or hassle from making the switch I agreed. Yippy, I now have a student checking account. I can use any ATM anywhere at any time free of charge.<br/><br/>From the time the account was changed I have been receiving ""Maintenance Fees"" to my savings account. I know I should watch this more closely but I usually just use my checking account and keep tabs on it.<br/><br/>After all of the hassle I have had and the number of calls I have had to make and the time spent on the phone with representatives I decided I would like to try another more locally owned bank.<br/><br/>When the phone finally stopped playing elevator music and I was connected to a real live person I was told the fees could not be reversed and there was nothing he could do about the money. He said he had spoken to his manager and there was nothing he could do about it.<br/><br/>I asked if I could speak directly to his manager. Susan (Milwaukee Area Customer Service) answered the phone and asked what she could do for me. She verified who I was and her understanding of the situation. Her reply to my request was that because I was closing the account they had no incentive to refund the money. If I would be so kind as the keep the account and simply transfer back to the ""Gold Package"" she would be happy to refund the money. <br/><br/>I explained that the whole reason I had the ""Student Checking Account"" was because another customer service representative told me that this account would be best for me and that there would be no more service fees.<br/><br/>Even after my explanation that I was told to make this account change by a representative to avoid future fees. Susan said there was no incentive to reverse the fees. I said to her. ""You are telling me you can not return my money because there is no incentive to correct your mistake?"" She said yes, you are closing your account there is no incentive to refund the money. (Not exact words, I did not record the conversation and am writing this from memory)<br/><br/>I have had an account in good standing with U.S. Bank for over five years and am told there is no incentive to return money to my account that was withdrawn in error. I also feel that this error is on their end of the table. The reason I feel the error is theirs and not my own is because the change to my account was made on advise and reassurances from a U.S. Bank customer service representative. (I also explained this to Susan) <br/><br/>The only way to get the money put back in the account (Money Wrongfully charged to me) was to keep the account and have it transferred back to a ""Gold Package Account"". The very same account I was advised to change into a student account by a different representative. <br/><br/>NOW, the reason I am posting this is because I feel after several years of schooling for Business Management I have a small grasp of ""customer service"" and the ""INCENTIVE"" to keep customers satisfied. I was not really upset with the company or anyone in it, I only wanted to avoid further hassle while in school and working. <br/><br/>Now, after a very dissatisfying hour on the phone with the U.S. Bank Customer Service Representative, Susan. I feel I should share my experience with other U.S. Bank account holders, current and future to inform them of this situation.<br/><br/>I am very dissatisfied and would like to perhaps save others the same headache I have had. For those of you that have taken the time to read this entire re-telling, I thank you and ask that you please share this story with others. <br/><br/>Thank You,<br/>Dan",2012-10-27

I noticed this the following day, as well as a $30 fee for the cash advance. I went into my branch to explain the mistake. They remedied the mistaken transfer, but said to call the number on the back of the credit card to see about having the fee forgiven. I called, explained what I had done, and before I could even ask about having the fee waived the agent on the phone said she was waiving the fee. <br/> <br/>I'm as astonished as anyone by this - I haven't felt I had truly customer friendly service from any financial institution in a very long time.

However when I went to them for a small car loan, they rejected my request because of lack of credit history. How can credit history be built if your bank does not lend you money.

3118,If It Was Possible To Give Zero Stars....,8834,77,US Bank,7488,1,"This is THE worst bank that my husband and I have experienced. Let's start at the beginning:  Our debit cards were sent to an ex's house, not an address we had EVER given the bank. Had to call, get them to shut those cards down and order us new ones, took over a month. After we got married I called the 1-800-number and they told me all I would need to take to the bank was my new DL to get my name changed, I took off work, went in the branch and they told me they needed my new ss card, marriage license and for me to sign a new sig. card. When I recieved my ss card I took another day off work, took the card, my dl and marriage license in to a FSR, he made copies of everything and then told me my husband would need to come in and sign the sig. card- which meant my husband would have to take off work, so he did and we signed the cards. The FSR told me that he had just started there and that this was like his 2nd week, I didnt think anything of it. He said he would order my husband and I new cards (mine for the name change and his b/c his mag stripe didnt work) and that thewy should be at the house in no time. I knew that it would take more than a few days so we waited and waited. I finally got tired of waiting and since the branches were closed, I called the 1-800-number and told them the situation. The rep said my name had never been changed, new cards wern't ordered, that the first round of cards were still active and that there was not a new sig card on file. We would have to go into the branch to change everything again. Eventhough I was mad, I told her to at least order my husband a new card and I would go to a branch when I had time. She mentioned shutting down the old debit cards, so that no one would have acce3ss to our accounts (somethinbg they were supposed to do in the first place. So I told her 'let me give you the numbers of the cards we're currently using' (mind you this was a Friday night) she said 'it's okay, I can figure it out'. I thought everything was fine. My family ordered food online and I used my debit card, it kept saying my card was invalid, (the night before was pay day and I had used my card already once that day), so I tried to use my husbands and his said the same. Soooo, I called the 1-800-number and found out the stupid rep closed ALL the debit cards on the account. the new rep kept on with 'I'm sorry' 'I would be frustrated too' and my fav 'I completely understand'...at that point I let my husband have the phone, and they went round and round because they say they cant reactivate the card and that we'll just have to wait until we can go into  branch. My husband got names, id numbers and phone numbers and has an appt to speak with a manager.

They lock you in for a really low rate that is only good for 45 days then proceed to stall the process for the 45 day period, and then tell you the low rate is no longer available and the new rate is 1% higher. This after they have collected the processing fee and appraisal fee of more than $450 dollars. <br/> <br/>They were requiring signed and notarized documents, that after consulting with a Lawyer were not legally required for a loan application. US Bank said well no the documents weren't legally required, but they required them for their own records. In other words, they keep requiring new documents every week until the 45 days are up and they can change the rates. <br/> <br/>After a month and a half we still were never told a closing date, so I went to another lender. US Banks closing fees estimate was approximately $4,600.00. The new lenders fees are less than $1,000.00. The new lender is a Savings and Loan that I found here on DEPOSITACCOUNTS.COM that has a 5 star rating in everything. And after talking with them they deserve it. It was a great pleasurable experience after working with US Bank, who deserves a -5 star rating. <br/> <br/> The closing date with the Savings and Loan (Home Federal Savings and Loan of Kenton, Ohio) is less than 30 days from the date of application. And the interest rate is 1/2 % lower than what US Bank offered. <br/> <br/> Do your homework people, good banking institutions are out there, you might have to dig to find them but they're there. US Bank is NOT one of them. I have come to find out that more than half the paperwork US Bank ask for is not necessary other than to use as a delay tactic to stall the process and be able to charge a higher interest rate.",2012-02-16

3135,They Don't Care About Anything But Your Money,6036,77,US Bank,661,1,"I am still currently a member of US Bank, but am trying to switch. The problem is, that I am a student and I have to find a bank in this tiny town that is also found in my home town, not that easy. I was receiving loan refund money from my school and last year, I got back $4,000 each semester, but when summer hit, and I ran out of money, my bank account went from being in the thousands to barely 100. This is when all of my problems hit. I opened the account back in 2008 for my college reasons. I set it up where it would not allow me to overdraft. Meaning, if I did not have the money in my account, it would not let me use the card. The first time it let me overdraft to $100 until my card was shut off and I was expected to pay this and the daily overdraft fee even though I was never informed I had over-drafted since I wasn't supposed to be able to. I set the account back to not being able to overdraft. I did this 3 times and I have finally marked my account in my checkbook as being approx. $30-50 less than what I actually have so I do not overdraft again. Each time, they would not refund any of the fees or anything. I had excellent customer service until my account balance plummeted. After that, the bank has been stealing money, usually around $40 a month (noticed it around July before I started marking my checkbook wrong), they would use excuses for my overdrafts such as I over-drafted due to using my card at a gas pump, which by the way I hadn't gotten gas in over a week and I always go inside, and they charge me $15 a month for not having more than $1000 in my account when I am supposed to have student checking, and I have attempted to switch my account twice. I am very angry, sounds like I am ranting, and feel like a helpless human being. I want to just keep all of my cash in a coffee can hidden in my yard or something.

I have a basic checking account and a credit card through USBank. When I first opened my account, I was a student, and they set up a special account for me, but have never changed it. Basically my account is set up so that if I overdraw, USBank places $200 in my account (up to $1500) and then charges a $2 fee for each $200 placed in my account. I only utilized this once, and I paid it back within a month, so I'm not sure if I would be charged anything else for this service. I also have a credit card through the bank. My rates have never increased, and for awhile, I was charging and paying off each month, and they increased my limit from around $900 all the way up to $2900 in less than a year! I participate in online banking as well, and it's very easy to use. Once I log in, all my accounts are right there, and it's easy to pay my credit card bill or even other bills!

3146,A Bank That Threatens It's Customers?,4720,77,US Bank,661,1,US BANK solicited my business years ago so I opened an interest paying checking account with them. As long as I kept at least $2000 dollars in the account they paid interest on the balance with no fees. When they changed their policy of paying interest on accounts with a balance above $2000 I reduced the amount I kept in the account but kept it open in anticipation of a return to a policy of paying interest in the future. US Bank recently mailed a notice that they would start charging fees. I went to US Bank to close my account because of their pending fee increase. After cashing my check for the account balance the teller told me that the account would not be closed and they would still charge fees against a zero balance effectively creating a negative balance. She also told me that if I didn't pay those fees that it would create a negative event on my credit report.

The annual fee for your IRA plan is increasing from $10 to $30. The balance requirement to waive this fee is also increasing from $5,000 to $25,000 for IRA plans and from $1,000 to $5,000 for Coverdell Education Savings accounts (CESA). In the past, your fee may have been waived automatically if you were over age 70 1/2 and receiving automatic distributions from your IRA plan. This automatic waiver will no longer be applied.""<br/><br/> With the low interest rates being offered some folks may actually be losing principle to these fees now.

3155,Not Just A Branch Issue: 3 Different Legs Of US Bank Stink.,3102,77,US Bank,1636,1,"I chose US Bank as a matter of convenience; they have a branch in my grocery. But, one constant problem has been that they turn over employees at this branch on a monthly basis. This has been a complaint of mine since I noticed the trend to the point of having to laugh with every new face – hello number 48, hello number 49! Most recently, right after I commented to the new teller that she was the 50th person to stand behind that counter, she had the nerve to tell me (2 minutes later) that she would be putting a hold on my $5000 deposit, “since she didn’t know me.”<br/><br/> Currently, I am awaiting a refund of $6100 that was mistakenly paid twice to a US Bank credit card. They told me that such a refund usually takes 7 days, but since it is US Bank to US Bank, it should be quicker. Today is day #8. Last night, their customer service agent, Nathan, confirmed that this was the 7th day and nothing has happened regarding this issue.<br/><br/> Past issues (major): When I went in to a US Bank Business office I asked the woman about opening a new business account. When I casually mentioned the issue of the revolving-door staff and that the latest new teller had tattoos on her hand (gang tats!), the woman got huffy and said, “Well I guess you don’t like me either, because I have tattoos, too!” Gee, lady, they aren’t on your hands looking like you got them in a prison cell – do you discriminate between the two?<br/><br/> On an international transfer, US Bank failed to mention that there would be an extra middle-man bank which would skim their share and alter the final destination amount.<br/><br/> I could go on, but this bank isn’t worth my time. I’m obviously not worth theirs. But then there’s this:<br/><br/> I went down to present the things written above to the US Bank manager (main branch). He is on vacation. Next in line: She took my letter that was addressed to the bank manager, and said, “he’s on vacation.”  No offer to help, just that statement of redundant fact. Duh, that’s why I’m speaking to you and not him – are we both on the same page now? I asked her to read the letter. She read, wobbled her head with a mental “yadda-yadda,” completed her reading and responded: These issues aren’t about our branch. (Actually, you personally handled the international transfer, lady!) No offer to help again, so I presses her: Can you find out where my $6,100 is? Ultimately: her records show only one payment on the credit card, and finally: the check’s in the mail. US Bank to US Bank – and the check’s in the mail (payment is being processed)!<br/><br/> I reminded her that I have already suffered an overdraft fee and that I would need to access my line of credit to be sure I don’t suffer another. She sympathized. Whoopee. No offer to remove the overdraft fee. She couldn’t care less. I guess that’s why she came into the office with a nasty, loose-phlegm cough. Glad she didn’t try to shake my hand, but I’ll still probably get sick on top of the stress of “where’s my friggin’ money?” <br/><br/> Memories of the famous “You can’t have your money” account at B of A and the surly staff at the local Albertson’s grocery.",2010-11-24

When my husband and I went to the bank with our safe deposit key to retrieve the documents we had placed in our box years ago, the bank manager refused to give us our documents. She said she could not verify that our key was the one that fits the lock on our box, because the lock on our box had been changed when its contents were removed. A police officer took our statements. <br/><br/>The bank employee thought perhaps our documents were removed from our box because we hadn't paid the annual rental fee. Our key was to box #4, a 3 x 5 box, which costs less than the $100 credit towards rental fee that is a benefit of our Performance Select Account. The manager confirmed to the police that our account has this benefit, but still refused to give us the documents that had been removed from our box. <br/><br/>I am frustrated and at a loss. The employee contacted us because she saw that the documents had our names on them. We have the title to our home, my mother-in-law's power of attorney and living will, etc. These documents can't possibly have value to anyone except us.

The way it was in the beginning was that you could purchase your own paper checks to use and you could receive electronic deposits but if you went to the bank in person they would charge you a fee. So as long as you used their ATM to deposit cash, received only electronic deposits and never used a ""human"" for customer service then it was worth it, you also received a debit card with a MasterCard logo so you could pay bills etc.<br/>Things were going fine for a year, I never was charged anything as I made sure to never use their customer service in person.<br/>Then 1 day I went to log in and my account had a $13.99 charge on it from the bank, I thought to myself ""What is this""?

April of 2017 I contacted Customer service to get some help on this issue to which they also couldn't help and told me what I already knew. So at that point I decided to visit my local branch, to which the customer service representative tried their best to help. They phoned into corporate and they opened a case with ""internal review"". Three weeks goes by before I hear anything and they also couldn't over ride the fees. I was left in the dark for three weeks, and at the end of it wasted my time. The Website/Mobile app are also severely outdated looking along with ATM's the user friendliness of the Interfaces are horrible. Upon becoming frustrated with this financial institution I did some research into other banks and found out they are one of the worst in checking account rates and just overall customer experience. I then at this point submitted to the ""Office of Comptroller"" my overall experience with ""PNC"" to which they ruled in my favor. PNC at that point was still being defiant and didn't work with them/me. I at this point decided to just drop the bank all together.

Having lived in South Florida all my life I have had my share of hurricanes, most of which shut down everything (including banking) for at least a week. PNC in the past has allowed fees and pre authorized bills to come out even though there were no branches in the area open and no way to deposit money. Say a bill was pre authorized on the 15th of September, and the hurricane hits on the 4th of September. Power is not restored until the 21st of September. Normally one would have had 9 days to deposit money before the bill is due, but since no branches are open its impossible. PNC SHOULD waive any fees and not let anything go through, however they really don't care. If you call the number you talk to people in Pennslyvania and they have no idea what hurricanes are like. You have to go to your local branch to get the fees removed. Also they offer to waive fees for a week but typically storm power outages last way past that.

3191,$300 Opening Account Scam,26799,7102,PNC Bank,37056,1,"Recently I was looking for a new bank and noticed that the PNC branch near me was advertizing a $300 bonus for newly opened accounts. It sounded intriguing. If you don’t want to read to the end I can tell you that this experience instead ended up costing me $25 and a serious amount of wasted time.<br/><br/>Although I consider myself a very savvy consumer and I did smell “if-it-sounds-too-good-to-be-true – it-probably-is”, I thought banking was based on trust and not on fine-print rip-off tactics. Who wants to put their savings in the hands of an institution that tries to make money off you on cute gimmicks? Well, the PNC bank thinks you do.<br/><br/>The account product that was offered to me required monthly direct deposit amounts and the use of the linked credit card at a rate that were ridiculously easy for me to meet. I actually felt quite satisfied when I had just become a new customer. I then proceeded to direct my employer, on-line, to change my bi-weekly salary deposits to PNC and waited to use my new credit card until this had taken effect so that I had the required funds to cover the purchases. <br/><br/>Here is where they get you. The requirements have to be satisfied within a time window that is shorter than the time it took my employer to change the direct deposit!! It is very probable that the sales clerk told me about the time issue, and it was undoubtedly in the fine-print somewhere, but it simply didn’t register with me. Why would anyone pay attention to such a scheme? If you well meet the requirements (and I am a very good deal to any bank) you assume that they will honor the deal that attracted you to them in the first place.<br/><br/>Needless to say I redirected my deposits again and once it had taken effect attempted to transfer my funds out to another bank using the PNC on-line tools. This didn’t work, since they impose a ridiculously small monthly cap on what you are allowed to transfer that way. I then had to visit the branch where I had opened the account and was told that there was a $25 penalty for terminating the account!!! I gladly paid it, got my check and left PNC for good.<br/><br/>What this experience told me was that PNC is about making a quick buck on anyone. They clearly have no interest in building long-term trust with customers. This may be old-fashioned but is something I still expect from an institution that I entrust with my money. I can only imagine the many other fees and restrictions I would gradually have discovered if I had had to stay with this shady outfit. (If you wonder about the clerk who originally opened the account for me, he had skipped town and was not available for comments).",2017-02-20
3192,Terrible HELOC Servicing,26252,7102,PNC Bank,35608,2,"DO NOT open a HELOC with PNC. I took out a HELOC in late September 2016 in order to fund needed home repairs due to toxic mold issues in my house. Since opening the account, NEVER have I experienced such dysfunctional servicing of an account. In order of irritation:<br/><br/>1. For some absolutely ridiculous reason, PNC has 2 separate departments that handle customer service for their HELOCs. One only handles issues and transactions made through the HELOC card, the other only issues and transactions made through the accompanying checks. Neither department can access the information the other has, and both have different hours. This leads to an exceptionally frustrating experience when attempting to resolve any issue that may involve the account as no one at the bank seems to have a global view of your account at any time.<br/><br/>2. Unlike security checks with every other financial organization on the planet, if you call the customer service number on the back of the HELOC card you cannot speak with anyone in the HELOC card department unless you have your full account number with you. This number only appears on your checks and HELOC statements. You can provide your name, address, phone number, SSN, DOB, any and all information off the card itself to the representative, but if you don't have the full account number they will refuse to speak with you. If you are out and about and need an issue resolved quickly, unless you have the account number memorized you're utterly out of luck.<br/><br/>3. While I appreciate the lengths to which banks go to extend fraud protection, the PNC HELOC division is ridiculous in regards to the frequency of how many times card swipes have been declined for even tiny amounts. I had a card transaction for around $30 declined while the very next day a check cleared for several thousand dollars against the account. The several occasions I have had to contact the HELOC card division to clear up issues such as this, I have regularly received misinformation, misdirection, and have had to call back multiple times to resolve issues I was told had been taken care of.<br/><br/>4. While regular checking and savings accounts at PNC appear to exist in the modern day of online banking, the HELOC division seems to still be abiding its time in the late 90s or early 00s. Logging into your online account and accessing the HELOC area, you cannot access any HELOC statements online and cannot view check images that have cleared. The only way to get HELOC statements is by mail and check images by special request.<br/><br/>All in all, working with PNC after the HELOC was approved has been an abysmal experience. If you're considering PNC for this type of lending, just don't. I have worked in the financial services industry for some time, and am staggered by the sheer incompetence with which PNC services this account type. You would have an extraordinarily more pleasant experience whacking yourself in the head repeatedly with a 2x4.",2017-01-07
3193,PNC Bank at my local Shop Rite,26134,7102,PNC Bank,35335,4,My local PNC bank branch is just plain ok. I have wasted way too much time and too many times going there just to be sent away to a full branch. My recent experience was that I needed to get a cash advance from my other bank card (this is one of the services that PNC offers). I came in to my local branch and after about a 20 minute wait the clerk said they cannot offer this service at this branch and I had to drive 5 miles to another location. Outside of ATM services i find this bank useless. And more often than not just to deposit a check I have to wait 20 minutes.,2017-01-04

PNC's online banking service through their virtual wallet account is extremely user-friendly and intuitive. By simply using a slider on your virtual wallet page, you are able to transfer money into one of three separate accounts; checking (spend), saving (reserve), and growth. PNC's customer support both by phone and in person is also excellent. Their staff have all been very willing to help and interested in seeing a solution the whole way through.

I tried to post this review without any stars but I am unable to.<br/><br/>(Downtown Pittsburgh Branch) I had opened an account with them and received a direct deposit refund of $1600 from the IRS. When it was available, I began to make purchases. The next day I was astonished to find that my balance was negative a few hundred dollars due to eleven bounce fees totaling nearly $400! Upon calling the bank they told me that the funds were deposited and available, but they had a policy that I must wait 24 hours for the money to ""clear."" It was ridiculous! Available means available, and since when does a direct deposit need to ""clear?"" I went through customer service rep after supervisor after supervisor until finally people started asking, ""How did you get this number? Were management, we don't deal with these things."" After 2 hours, the final verdict came from a vice-president or a person of similar status who would reduce the fees to half and refused to allow me to speak with anyone else above her! I still refuse to pay them anything and have closed the account, but they still got away with several hundred dollars of my money.<br/><br/>(PNC Robinson Branch) As it has been a few years since, I forget the origin of why the check was given to me, I remember only that it was a refund issued from PNC bank. It was for a mere $12. When I attempted to cash it, they told me that there would be a $10 fee to cash it. Any other time, a cashing fee for non-members is expected, but being that the check was only $12 and was being refunded to me from a mistake on PNC's part, I found it unbelievable that they would not waive the fee! My only option was to have them cash it and give me $2. What a con, you refund me $12 only to take back $10 of it as a fee!<br/><br/>(PNC Sheraden Branch) Most recently, I was in a terrible car accident which left me with no car and barely able to walk. I had to hobble my way onto a bus to get to a doctor's appointment and found myself with just a hundred dollar bill. I painfully walked to a corner store near the bus stop and asked if they could break it, but they refused. Luckily, or so I thought, there was a PNC bank across the street. The cashier refused to give me change because I was not a member. I was visibly injured (my face was swollen, I was in a cast and on crutches) and I explained to her that I had to catch a bus in just a few minutes and that I was on foot. The corner store was unable to break it and that this bank was the only business within 3 miles. It was impossible for me to make it anywhere else and it was very important that I get to the doctor's office because the appointment was regarding the injury to my eye and it was threatening my vision. She strongly refused and told me that she could only make change for members, and that I could set up an account. I couldn't believe it. They're a BANK! What place should you go to to make change other than a bank! I certainly didn't have time to open an account before my bus came, and I certainly didn't want to based on past experience. Even though I was barely able to walk, she directed me to a bank branch that was over 5 miles away and told me to try there, otherwise I had to leave, because she was not going to make change for me regardless of my situation. I was completely appalled. <br/><br/>How can PNC bank treat people like this? Member or non-member, they simply just DO NOT CARE about you. As long as they make their money, then you do not matter. I was treated terribly by the bank before this most recent incident, but that teller's staunch refusal to simply make change for a badly injured person goes beyond a disregard for people, it was completely heartless. It's disgusting what this bank thinks it can do to people. <br/><br/>Ashley K.",2014-04-16

3212,Run Around!,15928,7102,PNC Bank,15634,1,"I have been banking with PNC for over five years and have a good track record with them. I have never had a problem with the bank until I started banking online. For years I have gotten a run around from customer service just to answer a question on the phone. In the past couple years I have been using https://www.onlinebanking.pnc.com/alservlet/OnlineBanking<br/><br/>for all my transactions. It's advertised as 24/7 and they have customer service to assist you. This is the third time since spring of 2013 that I have gotten a run around. Back in the spring 2013 I called there customer service representative number and ask if it was possible to change the due date for my credit card to a day after I get paid. I was told that no I could not change it, because when I signed up I pick a due date. So with this misleading information I kept my due date. In November of 2013 I had to pay my minimum payment the next morning at 6:00 because my pay check did not come until the day after the due date. So of course I'm charged a late fee. Then I had explained my situation that I am getting paid once a month and the due date is always before I get paid. I asked to see if I could have it waived because I do have a good track record with PNC. Then a man simply explains to me I could have changed my due date, anytime I want to. That was my first bad experienced of how PNC representatives mislead you with information. So on, in January my credit card bill shows in this exact format. <br/><br/>Balance: $900.32 <br/><br/>Minimum Payment Due: $0.00 <br/><br/>Payment Due Date: 01/16/2014<br/><br/>Note: There is only a date, not a time listed!

As soon as I make it shows up on my transactions as:<br/><br/>01/17/2014 <br/>ONLINE CREDIT CARD PMT 01/17 <br/><br/>THIS IS FALSE INFORMATION THAT WAS ADDED TO MY ACCOUNT<br/>So I call back today too see what happened and I was told because I made the payment after 5pm it's considered the next day. This bank advertises them selves online as 24/7 also on my online bill it said nothing of due before 5pm. I talk to a manager and they tell me I can find it in the terms of my agreement when I signed Up. Now I have been navigating this website for a while and I just requested a copy for my self. I cannot find one that say due before 5pm yet. Even if I do end up finding it, the fact they have no time listed on my actual bill is misleading. The manager I spoke with also told me there was no one else I can talk to, when I ask to speak with someone else. I called back 20 minutes later and requested to speak with another manager and she says there is always more than one manager on the floor. That's three complaints I am making against PNC Bank. Misleading and non helpful customer representatives. Misleading information online and on bills to the customer eye. And last misleading management. Need I say More.",2014-01-18

This was inconvenient, but not the end of the world.  What came next was shocking however, a series of boilerplate and scripted responses to my requests for a resolution.  Finally, I was notified that they would address my issue, via mail, IN 90 DAYS.  Furthermore, the call center attendants claimed they could not speak to me about the dispute, and that the dispute resolution department could only communicate via mail. <br/><br/> Really, no joke, 2013 and PNC has a department that will only communicate via snail mail.  The $150 looks like it is going through just fine, but the message has been delivered to me very clearly - I do not matter to PNC as a customer.  The deposit should clear in the next week or so, then I'm going to close my accounts and move back to my credit union. <br/><br/> Too bad, because my profile is one that I have a been PNC customer for 5 years, have a 740 credit score, direct deposit, a personal line of credit, and a credit card.  You would think that would be a customer they would like to keep....but apparently not. <br/><br/> So my next couple of weeks will be spent transferring my checking/bills to my credit union, as well as finding every bank review site that I can; to warn others to steer clear of PNC and find an institution that values you.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/> -A",2013-07-22

I call the 800 PNC BANK number and they tell me, ""It should be there, maybe the Post Office messed up."" I checked the mailing address where PNC was meant to send it and everything checked out with PNC. The person on the phone even said, ""Hello, Can I help you,"" instead of answering the phone and waiting until you initiate the conversation, otherwise hanging up. Tried this little trick at least 5 times to see if PNC Bank was at least consitently idiotic.<br/><br/> I wait another day or two and nothing.

Then they say, we can send another card out to you but it will take a minimum of 5-7 days.<br/><br/> So it is day 17 of waiting for PNC to let me get my money.<br/><br/> But they won't do ANYTHING to help me access my money until that card comes.<br/><br/> Then I call up the local ""Personal Banker"" in Wayne PA, Arron Specifcally, and get the same crap. I asked why he hadn't contacted me and he says ""I tried to call you multiple times, and I sent you a note. Post Office must have lost it."" So I ask Arron, so who did you call (what number), and he pulled a phone number I had while I lived in Georgia, but had nothing to do with anything PNC.<br/><br/> Where did they steal my 20 year old, closed, Atlanta address and phone number from???? I did not give it to them or grant them permission to get it.<br/><br/> So I ask, why didn't you use the phone number on my application to contact me. And how come you didn't make sure you got in contact me? I was a new customer and I guess that is a bit too much for PNC Bank.<br/><br/> Then I asked why PNC Bank data entry and New Accounts Review (I had to be vetted to become a member of this supposed bank), use the information I provided on my application.<br/><br/> AND WHY PNC BANK PULL AN ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER I HADNT USED FOR 15 YEARS TO SET UP MY ACCOUNT INSTEAD OF THE INFORMATION I PROVIDED ON MY APPLICATION THE DAY BEFORE?<br/><br/> MORE EXCUSES FLOWED OUT OF ARRONS MOUTH THAN I EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY VERY POOR BANKERS. ACTUALLY PNC IS A JOKE.<br/><br/> I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER TO THE PNC (Pittsburgh Narco Crooks - because they must be on drugs) AS LONG AS YOU GIVE THEM SOME $$$$.<br/><br/> And how come if Arron got a phone that said it was not in service, did he not look at my application with the correct phone number and use it????<br/><br/> Then he says, oh, our data entry people (are you sure PNC isn't using mice for data entry?) must have keyed in the wrong information. So I ask, if they did not use the application you made me fill out, what did they use??? Befuddled, confused, and acting defensive now, he goes, ""They took it off your application."" Five minutes before this person said they didn't.<br/><br/> WELL I GUESS PNC BANK thinks that Atlata GA is the same as Phila PA, that my old phone number that starts with 770 kinda looks like 610.<br/><br/> They should just apply for the mental dissability now.<br/><br/> So I had to ask Arron at PNC, what application did this bank use to create my account. The app I filled out last week with you in this office to open this account, or the one that says PNC wants to mess things up as badly as possible so it can float my money until I sue them.<br/><br/> So then I find out, PNC Bank did not even bother to look at my application, they just keyed in some old address from when I lived in Atlanta, and that is where they sent my ATM card. This is despite checking with the brank morons and the 800 number morons.<br/><br/> But the really spooky thing is that I never had a single IOTA of business with PNC when I lived in Atlanta, and how they got my personal information from when I lived in Atlanta is something I am going to sue them to find out because I did not give it to them or grant them access to it.<br/><br/> So overall here is a ranking of PNC customer servcie and capabilities<br/><br/>  Can take application - Yes if you give money<br/> Can take application and open account without getting confused - NO<br/> Can live up to their promises - ZERO or 0%<br/> Will they give you access to you money while they mess up - NOT A CHANCE<br/> Will they do ANYTHING to make up for messing up so completely - ZERO - ZILCH - but they will take more of your money<br/> Will PNC Bank let you use your money as promised - NO<br/> Will PNC Bank take as long as possible whenever possible to keep you from your money - YES<br/> Will PNC Bank use any excuse to cover their transgressions and try to blame you for it - YES - VERY CONSISTENTLY NO MATTER WHO<br/> If you call the 800 number to complain does anything happen - ZERO<br/> If you call the 800 number to find out why you can't use your money will give you a run-around so they can keep it longer - YES<br/> If you call up the PNC District office to complain will anything get done - ZERO = NO = <br/>  These are the people pocketing all the money - are you kidding<br/><br/>  IS PNC's main goal to take your money and keep it from you as long as possible - 100% DEFINITE<br/><br/>  IS PNC a really messed up bank - 100% DEFINITE<br/><br/>  DOES PNC have a clue they are really messed up - ZERO<br/><br/>  DOES IT LOOK LIKE PNC IS CAPABLE OF IMPROVING - ARE YOU KIDDING - THESE MORONS NEED TO BE ELIMINATED<br/><br/> In conclusoion, here are my final thoughts about PNC Bank<br/><br/> PNC stands for PLease No Customers Bank (after you deposit some money)<br/>or<br/>PNC stands for PLEASE do NOT COME BACK after you deposit OUR money.<br/>or<br/>PNC stands for Provides No Cash<br/>or<br/>PNC stands for Punch Next Customer<br/>or<br/>PNC stands for Pure Non Competence<br/>or<br/>PNC stands for Probably No Cash 4U (if you look at their balance sheet)<br/>or <br/>PNC stands for Plush Car & Bank (account for the people who run it).<br/><br/> Don't let this bank fool you.<br/><br/> They will close their doors and keep your money if things go bad in future.<br/><br/> They have a D credit rating meaning good luck getting your money if their investment division messes up and needs your money like they did in 2008, and PNC has a Texas Ratio out the Window, meaning they are a big part of the group that helped craeate the 2008 financial meltdown.<br/><br/> We should be able to line the PNC people up and whip them evey time they tell a lie or blame somebody else for their incredible stupidity, lack of customer service, and BOZOs in the Branches.<br/><br/> Should be able to let the local indiginous population teach them how to really be the bums they are acting like. (What they need to learn to live on the streets after they STUPID themselves out of business).<br/><br/> They USED TO HAVE A GOOD REPUTATION.<br/><br/> Now I would trust my 4 year old dog to do a better job of banking. <br/>Also could not trust this bank to come through in a clutch. <br/>If they are this bad now, just think how bad they would be if there is another financial crisis.<br/><br/> This bank is really REALLY UNBELIEVABLY INCOMPETENT AND THE PEOPLE WORKING THERE ARE VERY STUPID.<br/><br/> Try this: make something happen or just complain and the PNC idiots will come up with more excuses than a two year old that ate too much suger.<br/><br/> Only problem is, the babies at PNC think your money is their sugar and do not have any capacity beyond what a baby has.<br/><br/> Jazzzzzz",2013-04-16

I had an item come out of my account early, which over-drafted me $41. So instead of sending an alert to my phone, you know..that I signed up for..they just let me keep using my card and charged me over $250 in fees. It took a WEEK before I learned I was overdrawn, and that was by accident at their banks' ATM-it was STILL going to let me take out money. I asked to be opted out 3 TIMES for that ****** o-d protection. When I asked why I never recieved an alert that my account was over drawn, the response:<br/><br/> ""Well, you opted to get an alert when your balance is below $100.

3224,Worst Bank Ever.,11474,7102,PNC Bank,10663,1,"My husband and I opened a savings and checking account with PNC shortly after our wedding last year. The only reason we chose this bank was because of the supermarket locations that have more extended hours than other banks in our area. Since opening this account we have had nothing but problems. These are just a FEW of them. -The first was a small issue, they spelt both of our last names wrong (2 different ways) and my husbands middle initial was wrong as well on the debit cards they mailed. So I called after noticing, they told me they fixed it and would send new cards out. The new cards were still spelled incorrectly (our last name only has 5 letters, so I'm not sure why it was so hard for them). So we tried to go up to our local branch (Severna Park, MD). And we were again told they would send new ones. Mine was corrected, his was not? These people are so incompetent. After sending a total of 5 cards for my husband, they finally sent it with the correct spelling. The following week my husband tried to make a withdrawal through the drive-thru and gave them his ID, well apparently the name had been corrected on the debit card, but not on the account information. So because his name didn't match they wouldn't let him make a withdrawal!!!! It took over 2 months to finally get everything corrected. NEXT ISSUE -We tried to deposit a check for a little over $400 through their ATM because it was after hours. Well the next day we checked the online banking site to see if it had posted. There was NOTHING showing anything was even pending. I went up to the branch (with the ATM receipt) and was told by the rude teller they had no idea what happened to the check/deposit and to come back the next day to see if it showed up. Went back the next day, was told again to come back the next day. Went back a final time and asked to see a manager. She told me that they couldn't do anything because the ATM checks had been sent out to the processing center and that I should've come in the morning after the deposit! I WAS FURIOUS because I was there 3 days in a row, if the teller had of just went to get a manager it could've been a lot smaller of an issue. So the manager ended up sending a request to corperate to give us the funds that were recorded on the receipt. So a credit was then issued by corperate. Once it posted, I was shocked to see the amount issued was $42.89 instead of the $420.89 that was the correct amount. After hours on the phone, being transferred from one department to the next they finally set it straight. Almost 2 weeks after the initial ATM deposit was made, we finally had the correct amount... What a headache! NEXT ISSUE -We were told when we set up our Checking and Savings accounts that we could have them linked, so if the checking ever overdrafts, it would just take it out of the savings account. So we thought it was a great idea. They failed to mention they charge a $24 fee every time they do this, which is still cheaper than their $36 overdraft fee. We found this out the hard way. We made several purchases, just assuming the money would just be automatically withdrawn from the savings. We ended up with $120 in fees for using this automatic transfer. And after calling customer service we were told about this ""fee"" that had never been mentioned when the teller at the bank was giving her sales pitch. They removed 1 of the 4 fees. FINAL STRAW-The final issue we had before closing our account for good was because of an online purchase. The online purchase order did not go through because of some issues the retailers system was having. But a pending-pre-authorization amount was issued, but because the order didn't go through from the retailer they told me that amount would not post. Well I assumed a few days later that it would come off, so we made several other purchases. A few days later I checked the online banking site and saw we were issued 9 $36 overdraft fees which totals to $324!! Even though the preauth. credit had already disappeared from my account. I called the awful customer service line, and was hung up on 3 times before I finally got through to a representative. Well the representative hardly spoke English, and couldn't even understand the issue I was having. So he transferred me to online banking tech support, because I had mentioned that I checked my statement online. Needless to say tech support had no idea how to help me. So I was transferred yet again, to another person that I couldn't understand. After literally being brought to tears out of frustration and the loss of $324 and absolutely no help from the useless customer service line. I went straight up to the local branch and closed the accounts. I felt so good walking out of that bank knowing I would never step foot in that awful place again.",2012-11-16

Upon setting up the bill pay, we realized that becuaes we had seperate logins we were unable to see billers or payment information set up through the other person's login. This lead to posting a mortgage payment twice.  PNC would not cancel the payment and subsequently charged the account for insufficient funds.  Indeed because the account went negative they charged the account more than once.  When I called to complain, they were unhelpful and rude.  I proceeded to bring the account current and asked to close the account.  They indicated that there was a $25 charge as the account had only been open a few months, I said fine.  They next proceeded to tell me that the charge was per account (with the Virual Wallet you get three accounts for savings and spending) for a total of $75.<br/><br/> It seems to me that this is a back door tactic aimed at making me keep the account open and looking for ways to charge me additional fees.  I will never bank here again.",2012-10-17

My new account was unexpectedly closed because two checks out of six were returned as 90 days old. Most banks don't care and honor such checks, but some banks are strict. I informed PNC that I have requested the new checks already, but they didn't care and closed the account. They said that I have presented fraudulent checks, which is a lie; I have presented them checks generated by online bill pay. I immediately went to the bank that produced the checks with photocopies, given to me by PNC, and they confirmed that they are not fraudulent, but only 90 days old. I brought the written confirmation from that bank along with the business card of the employee who reviewed these checks completely. It didn't help at all; instead, I was told another story that ""there was a stop-payment order on these checks"". PNC then started telling me ""You must to understand"" (I must... the customer, can you imagine that??). So, I must to understand that PNC does't want to serve me at all. It was not a branch clerk (the branch clerk was helpful and very friendly), it was the upper management (Account Review Department). <br/> <br/>The bottom line is this: PNC acts not only like a non-professional idiot, PNC is also a malicious liar.

PNC has been okay for the most part but my concerns are their rigidity and their inability to make any kind of decision on a local level. I recently needed payoff amounts for the mortgages at PNC. No one could even give me the name or contact phone number to get these amounts. I called several 800 numbers given to me and finally got someone in Pittsburgh who knew someone who might know about that? ridiculous!! I needed to set up wire transfer data and no one at the local branch knew how to do it? I wanted to see about re-financing my commercial mortgages with PNC and this took several rounds of 800 calls again to locate the person who is my rep in my area because they had just taken over RBC and reassigned all of their staff to bring on the RBC crew. I finally get a hold of my new rep ( I never knew the old one!) he has just come over from RBC bank so he is really clueless and proceeds to ask for 2 years of tax returns and reviews my bank statements and assures me that he will have an answer for me asap as I am already a customer. 3 weeks later, he informs me that I need the most recent P&L and an explanation of all of the charges on my credit cards to assure that they are business expenses before PNC will underwrite!! meanwhile I am waiting for an answer from him thinking the refinance is being underwritten!! he shows up today at my business with some goofy tote bag and other useless swag and 3 other bank managers to just say Hi!! Really?!! Why don't they just stay at the darn bank and learn how to underwrite loans and do wire transfers and leave us alone to just survive out here!! Jeesh!

3239,Worst Bank Ever! Stay Far Away!,8074,7102,PNC Bank,6391,1,"Would give them no stars if there were an option. I had been banking with Bank of America for several years and I decided to switch to PNC because they had a local branch and BOA did not. I have banked with several banks over my lifetime and I have never had such horrible customer service as I have had with PNC. My account was in the negative, which has happened to me before, nobody is perfect. This negative balance occurred the day before my checking account was suppose to receive my direct deposit of my payroll check. I get on the internet that morning to check my balance to make sure it was there and it was, my NSF fee had been covered by my payroll check. I decide to pay my electric bill before I leave out for work and my debit card was declined although it said on PNC that I had an available balance of over 1400.00. So I decide to go on to work, me with no cash hardly to my name and I have to stop to get gas, I work an hour away from my home. I try my debit card in the gas pump terminal and it is declined. So I go inside the gas station to use their atm to try to withdraw cash and it declines my card, I tried to write a check to the cashier and it declines my check. Luckily I had over 5.00 worth of change to put in my vehicle to continue on to work, I was running on fumes and me with over 1400.00 in the bank from my paycheck. I leave for work at 4 am in the morning so I was really worried about making it to work at that time in the morning and running out of gas on the side of the road and the temperature was like 10 degrees outside. I later called the customer service number and they told me my account had been frozen and my debit card had been closed. I asked why and they said where I had a negative balance and it was a fairly new account the branch manager of the bank usually makes that decision, so I called the branch manager. It did not do me a bit of good, she told me that I was lucky that they didn't close my account that they were actually giving me a break. Wow, I just made them some money by having NSF in my account and she said she was giving me a break by keeping my account open. I told her that it was my money and that I should have more control over it than they do and she acted like she could care less. She said that my debit card would be cancelled for 30 days if there were no NSF transactions. Well again I had another and they have put another hold on my account for an additional 30 days. Rediculous!!! I have never had this happen to me in the past before at any other bank, I don't know but I think that it would be much worse giving someone a book of checks than a debit card. I opted out of the overdraft protection as well for my account so I can't overdraft it by using my debit card. This bank could care less about how they treat their customers and it doesn't do you much good either to report them to the BBB. I don't think they will keep their doors open long if they keep treating their customers as if they own you and your money. I even told the branch manager I was switching banks and she told me to make sure that I keep enough money in there to cover any checks I had written, she could have cared less if she kept me as a customer or not. They also post your debits to your account before your deposits so beware! So please stay far away!!",2012-02-14
3240,PNC OVERDREW MY ACCOUNT,7597,7102,PNC Bank,5789,1,"I have had a account with PNC, Zion, IL for many years.  I always had received good service.  I moved out of the area in Oct 2010.  In November 2010, I stayed at a hotel that pre-debited my account for $20 for each night I was staying in case I used any amenties.  I was told by the hotel that this would not appear on my account and was not actually a debit.  However, PNC did consider this a debit.  I was told that because I had ""overdraft protection"" on my account they, PNC, set aside that amount of money. This overdrew my account. PNC started charging me overdraft fees. After my stay, the hotel did put through a credit and neither the debit or credit appear on my statement.  PNC had charged my account so many fees by then that it didn't matter - my account was overdrawn.  I spoke with customer service and the branch. I was told there was nothing anybody can do.  The branch stated this AFTER I told them I no longer lived in the area.  PNC would not even let me close the account to stop the fees from accrueing.  PNC continued to charge me until I was negative over $500!!!!  Then, they closed the account and sent it to collections!!!<br/><br/>PNC CHARGED ME OVER $500 IN FEES FOR A CHARGE THAT DIDN'T OCCUR!!!",2012-01-07

They lied about receiving my loan payment on time, but it was mailed every month early and therefore closed my account. Before that I took another amount of money on my existing loan, and was told it would be at the interest rate I already had. They gave me the money and raised the interest rate. After numerous calls and ignorant employees I got no where at all but rudeness. Right now all the loan has been paid off, and they don't have it on record.

3242,Worst Web Site And Telephone Banking Of Any Bank,7514,7102,PNC Bank,5682,2,"First, a little about me.  I have a lot more accounts than the average person, and when I use my local PNC branches, they are as good as any bank I use.<br/><br/> Before the purchase of National City, most of my accounts were NCB, but I also had accounts with PNC opened online.  I now have two personal checking accounts, a savings account, two personal credit cards, one business checking account and one business credit card with PNC.  If you include the rewards programs I need four separate logins to view my information.  For comparison, I have more accounts at Chase, but I access everything on one page with one login.<br/><br/> Today I attempted to pay a PNC credit card from a non-PNC checking account that previously required a fifth login under credit card services, if I remembered not to click on a similar dead link.  With no notification at all, that service was eliminated sometime after my last payment.  To make a credit card payment I had to use the telephone system which gives everyone an error message the first three times they enter the last four digits of the CC account number.  They you select option 3 and enter the full account number and can use an outside checking account if you enter all the numbers quickly.  If you are a sixty-something customer like me rather than a teenager who does texting all day, you may not make it.  Customer service is aware of these problems, but if you pay by phone with a human being a $10 fee is charged.",2011-12-30

Called the next day and they said someone in another state 600 miles from me had withdrawel from my account.

No. No they would not as it turns out. As of 4 pm the following day I am informed that "" the atm deposit service is a day behind so your funds wouldn't be available until tomorrow"". I wish I had just waited to go to wal-mart to cash it now.

3247,I LOVE My Virtual Wallet Acct!!,4962,7102,PNC Bank,2920,5,"Before I elaborate on my Virtual Wallet with performance spend acct. I have to admit something... I work for a direct competitor of PNC.  With that being said this is NOT the opinion of some biased PNC employee.<br/><br/> Also, I have read all of the complaints below and I cannot believe how idiotic some of the people on here are.  Are you seriously going to complain about OD fees? Or that your elderly relatives caretaker took them to the bank and they comitted fraud? Or that the ATM doesn't return your card the second after cash is dispensed? I have news for you people, these are idiotic complaints and instead of blaming PNC or whichever bank you will switch to and have the same problems (you will) why not educate yourself on how to not overdraw your acct, or take your lazy ass to a banking center and withdraw your IRA so you can transfer it.<br/><br/> Anyways...<br/><br/> This is the best account set up for someone like myself who is into convienience banking.  I almost always use my debit card, have direct deposit, pay my bills online, and have auto transfer from checking to savings.  With that being said, I can do all of this and more w/ my virtual wallet.  The layout is in the form of a calendar which shows you the full picture for the month, I love this.  I also like how easy it is to navigate and manage the multiple accounts that comprise the VW (spend for everyday things, reserve for OD protection/short term savings, and growth for longer term/higher interest savings).  Not only do i get a decent interest rate on my growth balances (as of 6/14/11 it is higher than most banks in the Chicago market's shortest term CD special) I also earn rewards points for using my debit card and online banking.<br/><br/> The only improvements I would like to see are: an app for the android mobile phone OS that rivals the Itunes/Iphone version, and real time transaction balance posting like Chase bank does.<br/><br/> All in all PNC created the perfect acct for me and I think many more people such as myself will hopefully catch on to this because it's amazing.  It's as if they took everything I could ever want and fold it into a useful interface/acct pkg. I didn't even mention the budgeting tools they provide you with and the ability to ACH transfer money to other accts you may have at different banks or pay someone at another bank, again lifesavers!<br/><br/> If you're into online banking and you like having a complete view of your finances do yourself a favor and check the VW accts out!",2011-06-14

I had to go in for a class (2 hours, I think) and then they put me in this high-risk account for 6 months. I am please to say I just hit six months and I will be transferring into a normal account. I just love them because they gave me a chance to get my life together a bit, prove to them I could get my credit up and they are always so friendly in-person, through email and I have used chat a lot and they are especially friendly through the chat service.

3249,PNC Is Bad For Families And Bad For Business,4661,7102,PNC Bank,2677,1,"PNC took over a local branch of another bank and we imediately saw changes. They found ""cause"" to fire everyone over 40, including 2 long time employees. At first I have to admit I didn't think anything of it. They brought in cute young tellers and updated the furniture and the paint in the place. Everything looked great. But experience is what matters. A lady we knew took one of our elderly family memebers who had dementia to the bank and the young tellers didn't question anything. This woman switched all the relative's money into a safty-deposit box and then kept both keys, telling this elder that it was best for safety's sake. This woman also had the family member verbally revoke a power-of-atourney and again, the bank workers didn't question anything. When we confronted the bank about this, instead of recognizing and correcting their error, they became defensive, refered us to the legal department and closed down not just my mother's personal accounts but business accounts as well. However, without informing me they kept my account that had been joint with ours open. It took me 6 months to discover they had been making money off of my un-closed account. The bank made a difficult situation worse. PNC is marketing for the 20 and 30 somethings. Well, I'm a twenty something and they will never have my business. You treat older people in our community like that and you should expect to loose business.",2011-05-15
3250,WORST BANK EVER,4528,7102,PNC Bank,2569,1,"Where to even begin...<br/><br/>I was with National City when PNC bought them out.  I never received an updated debit card from PNC.  I called about this and was advised one was requested and in mail to me.  After a month of not receiving it and the date looming near of my National City card not working anymore, I went into a branch to have this taken care of.  The person I spoke with had been flown in from New Jersey to help with the merger...why they chose him...not real sure.  He advised me I could call and request it...I told him he could do it, and I would stand there until it was taken care of.  He called and got it taken care of so I thought.  He assured me I could still use my National City card until the PNC card arrived.<br/><br/>Cut to a few days later.  I'm in line at grocery store with a cart full of groceries and my 2 year old...I go to use my card, and it's declined.  So after being embarrassed by this, I leave my cart full of groceries and walk to the PNC located in front of the grocery store with my 2 year old.  I withdrew enough money to get me through and tried to calculate how much money I needed to keep in there for bills that were going through...not an easy task at this point with a 2 year old and another useless person behind the desk helping me.  I withdrew the money and also requested an order of checks be sent to my house as I still had National City checks.<br/><br/>A couple months later (still no checks had arrived), my husband and I had to move money around to each other for certain bills.  I moved money to his account, and that same day I moved it back to my account when we realized the charge would come to my account.  This created an overdraft fee for the 15 minutes the money was out of my account.  Really?  When I called to dispute this, the person on the phone was very argumentative with me and kept saying that while he is able to get the overdraft charge reversed, this isn't something that they do.  I have never been spoken to so rudely in my life.<br/><br/>Here we are now...yet again...another issue with overdraft charges.  I check my account and see 5 overdraft charges at $38 each in my account.  The first two overdraft charges occurred while there was still money in the account.  Consequently, charges that came through after that generated more overdraft charges.  Then a $2000 check gets deposited in my account that Friday, and 2 more overdraft charges occurred after that...once more overdraft charges occurring while there is money in the account.  I call PNC once more about this and am advised that I need to take my time and make the trip into a local branch to get these charges overturned.  I go into my local branch and speak with Tom, the manager on site.  He advises me he will check into getting them reversed and that he wasn't sure why there were overdraft charges while money was still in account, unless the money wasn't there.  He admitted their statements are confusing to read.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but if I see money in my account and overdraft charges in there...that's not right.  There should be no overdraft charges.  Don't give me a story about how it could be these ghost pending charges out there and not be able to show that to me on my statement...as he couldn't.  I had to leave for a flight so he informed me he'd follow up with me.  After I didn't hear back from him, I called and left him a message over the weekend.  Today is Monday, and I still hadn't heard from him so I contacted him again.  He advised me he was able to get 1 overdraft fee returned (which still hasn't shown up yet of course!) but no reason as to why only 1...when 2 charges occurred while money was still in account and when 2 more occurred after money was account.<br/><br/>I informed him I was leaving and going to Chase once my paycheck was deposited this Friday.  He became argumentative and advised me it would the same thing with them.  I informed him that when it was National City, my checks were available that same day they were deposited.  If we moved money around our accounts, that money was available that same day.  It's not with PNC, and I'm done with it.  I'm done with the fake overdraft charges, and I'm done with the lack of customer service.  He kept argueing basically advising me I was wrong and that I needed to read the fine print with Chase.  Time to let it go Tom.  Rather than argue with me about my leaving...help me.<br/><br/>PNC is losing a solid customer with direct deposit set up on their account because of the above.  My fault for staying with them as long as I did after the first few occurrences.  Ridiculous.  I have no idea how this bank is even still in business.<br/><br/> ",2011-05-02

There was no attempt to be friendly/ cordial with the customer (i.e. us) Zero customer service. Her attitude was impatient and nasty. I will not recommend this bank to anybody. It is baffling how PNC can stay in business with this type of employee running the branch. I could not believe how rude this woman is.<br/><br/> We will be closing our account and transferring the funds to another bank: definitely one that knows how to treat us like human beings. Awful experience and you can be sure all our friends will be informed about this incident.<br/><br/> Branch Managers should set the example of good customer service and not abuse their position of power and leadership.",2011-03-02
3252,From A Former National City Customer,3913,7102,PNC Bank,2128,2,"I was a National City Bank customer until they went belly-up about two years ago. I suppose they didn't entirely sink in the mud but were bought out for pennies on the dollar by PNC. The building is still the same but instead of the green National City sign it's now the navy blue PNC logo.<br/><br/>The changes inside the bank are negligible. The same friendly people work there and the counter is the same faux woodgrain finish. There is one major difference though. It's not inside the bank. It's outside, lurking. The PNC people changed the ATM machine. <br/><br/>The old ATM used to suck up your card, ask what account you wanted to deal with and eventually either spit out some money or sucked your check into its hole. When it was done with all this it spit out your card immediately.<br/><br/>The new ATM doesn't do this. It slurps up the card, spits out some money and then....wait for it...wait for it...spits out the card after about thirty seconds. By this time, and this is the drive thru I'm talking about, I'm long gone. Money in my pocket, on my way. Drove off without the card. I've had to pay for four new cards since the PNC takeover.

I also enjoy that my bank is very friendly and personal.

3256,Good Customer Service + Free Checking,3837,7102,PNC Bank,2075,4,"I have had a free checking account at PNC for about four years (I bank at a Washington, DC branch). I've been really pleased with the level of customer service, both at my branch and when I've contacted PNC through their website or 800 number. At my local branch, the tellers are super friendly and I don't get that ""everyone is ignoring the line"" feeling that you sometimes get at banks in the city. If I do have to wait (it's in a location with quite a bit of foot traffic), the manager on duty meets my eye and tells me they'll be with me shortly, and the teller always apologizes for the wait. The times I've had a problem or an inquiry that I've submitted online, I've received courteous, helpful replies. My only complaint would be that they say they will respond to e-messages within 24 hours, but several times it's been 48 hours or more. Also, they've done a courtesy waive on several overdraft fees for me -- they can't do it every time (after all, it's my fault if I'm overdrawn), but I appreciate the willingness to try to help when they can, especially since I have free checking and don't keep a very big balance, so they really aren't making any money from account. Finally, PNC's online banking has a user-friendly interface and good security (e.g., if I change my account information, I get an email and a text message alerting me). I don't keep much money in my PNC account, so they don't have a lot of financial motivation to take good care of me -- I think it's just part of the corporate culture. It's smart, though, becuase if I ever do have more money, they've earned my loyalty.",2011-02-19

3259,PNC For IRA Rollover Has No Wire Transfer & Only Accept Original Document,3037,7102,PNC Bank,1591,1,"My husband's IRA CD will mature soon but we haven't even received the CD maturity notice from PNC(2 days away from that maturity date)! <br/>But the most ridiculous thing is PNC doesn't even provide the wire transfer service for IRA CD rollover! <br/> <br/>The detailed story --<br/><br/> 1. I have to send the secure email to ask why we haven't received the CD maturity notice from PNC yet when it was only 6 days away from the CD maturity date. PNC replied was we have to call their IRA office. We called and PNC just said it already passed their 3-weeks notification timeframe of the maturing CD notice so they won't send it. <br/> 2. We then asked PNC to rollover my husband's IRA CD to other financial institution via ""wire transfer"". Surprisingly, PNC told us PNC does not provide wire transfer for IRA rollover; PNC only uses ""regular postal mail to send checks"" with $25 charge and they only accept ""original documents"" (no fax, no wire transfer). IRA rollover procedure has to be done via ""regular postal mail"" although the receiving financial institution provides wire transfer. <br/> 3. PNC do not track the mail either so it is up to the customer to track. We called PNC IRA department and they confirmed that the time line for customer to track the mail is as follows:<br/><br/> 1) customer sends mail to receiving bank to initiate the IRA transfer. (PNC only accepts original documents) <br/> 2) when receiving bank sends the IRA transfer form to PNC, customer needs to call PNC for 7-10 days to find out if PNC receives the IRA transfer form. <br/> 3) when PNC receives the IRA transfer form, customer needs to call PNC for the next 2-3 days to find out when PNC finishes processing and sends the check to receiving bank. <br/> 4) since PNC only use regular mail (not certified, not registered, not FedEx, not UPS) which cannot be tracked, customers needs to call the receiving bank for the next 7-10 days to see if the check is received by the receiving bank. <br/> 5) if the receiving bank does not receive the check in 7-10 days, customer needs to call PNC. It takes 2-3 days for PNC to research. So customer needs to call PNC for the next 2-3 days to find out if PNC will re-issue and re-mail the check. <br/> 6) If PNC mails the check again, repeat the steps 4 and 5.<br/><br/> The whole process is complicated, insecure, and time-consuming. PNC dumps the horrible burden/hassles to customers under their ridiculous IRA rollover method. We waited in the post-office for 40 minutes just by sending the initiating letter to receiving bank. Consider PNC is one of the top US banks, their service is unbearable.<br/><br/> <br/>PLEASE NOTE: This procedure can lead to many problems, e.g. if step 6) repeated many times, your money will just end up in PNC bank forever but without any interest.",2010-11-17

The reason is I deposit 3 checks from a company and checks were made from their closed account. As soon as I Realized it, I contact to company and they send me a new check included full total payment $4,200 however next day, after I deposit the check ( which is it cleared) they closed my account and put a hold on my balance. Because they have to investigate the situation. 3 months, an other months and an other 3 months. Finally investigation time is over but now they have been asking for proof of ownership of the fund. Now, last 3 weeks I have been running around everyday because everyday it’s new document. Yesterday they reply to my email and they want me to go to Bank of America (checks were made from someone else’s BOA account) and pull the check back and ask them to wire the money!

That’s not what I call convenience. Convenience is the Online Capital One Bank. I have several accounts with them. You can add beneficiaries to all your accounts “online” without having to drive 10 miles to a branch office. And guess what, when you call them you get a person on the phone.

We only found out when we went to use our debit card and it was declined and knowing we had more than enough money in our account. The charges they locked his card for were actually transactions. Onto a week later we had several charges from another city 3 hours away from us that were not ours we caught it and called customer service, Mary said they’d reverse the charges by end of business that day and there were also other charges they also saw coming in and also said they would take care of those as well. Next day they allowed the charges to go through knowing it was fraud and when calling the bank Saturday morning we were told it’s been submitted for review to refund.. this set me off! I said so you’re backing the thieves and f*ck the customer and I was told ( after being cut off several times as I was talking by Patience) no it’s the weekend and they have to wait until Monday. Perfect so any crook can rack up my account because it’s the weekend ?! So now we the “customer” just have to deal with having no money because it’s the weekend when this was told to them Friday morning. I will never bank with this worthless bank again and will for sure let everyone I cross paths with know the same. The incompent customer service you get with anyone your talk with every time we call is ridiculous!

I am constantly talked in circles about the issue. Sometimes when I have a large amount of money in my account I am charged twice for items. When I speak this issue to the customer service again, they are no help. I reported fraudulent activity that money was taken out of my account after a mobile check deposit for a bill, the company who was supposed to get the money did not receive the money and Subtrust has no way of tracing where the money was taken from.

When I went into my bank this morning I saw that Suntrust deposited the conversion over to us which is about 3,000 US dollars then they proceeded to put a 4 thousand dollar hold putting my account into the negative. I asked if they could reset the hold to the correct amount deposited so I could have back the money I already had in there as I have many bills to pay. They refused and stated to me we can’t remove the hold without contacting corporate office which will be on Monday. And most likely I won’t be getting a return call.

This happened while I was on a business trip leaving me with no access to any of my funds since I do not use credit cards. SunTrust says my funds will be released in 5 to 15 days.

THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ARE LITERALLY THE SAME TWO PEOPLE THEY SWITCH BETWEEN, and they always conveniently don't understand you when you get down to your issue. Its extremely frustrating and the fact that this bank can toy with the money of consumers so freely as if it isn't what we use to pay our bills and feed our families is terrible. they've taken so much money from me but wont even close my account, I've given up even fighting for what i've lost at this point. please save yourself the exhaustion and try a different bank.",2018-05-10
3287,My History with SunTrust Bank,33030,247,SunTrust Bank,50038,4,"When I moved away to college at Florida State University, just like every other student, I was automatically enrolled for a Checking Account with SunTrust. SunTrust bank has a location on campus and works closely with the university. This was my first bank account (I was 18); previously, I had only had a Savings Account in my parents' credit union.<br/> All of my money went through that SunTrust Checking Account; I had no active Savings Account again until I was 23. I primarily used my Checking Account via my debit card, and infrequently by writing checks or withdrawing cash from the on-campus SunTrust ATMs, which were extremely convenient. It certainly benefited me to have my primary bank account so easily accessible all around a large college campus.<br/> My only real source of income throughout most of college was my scholarships/student loans, which were deposited to my SunTrust Checking Account, as well as a $70 weekly allowance from my parents. In my Senior year I began working at Jimmy John's and finally began also utilizing my Checking Account for direct deposit for payroll.<br/> Another primary reason having the SunTrust account was extremely convenient for me is that it is linked to my parents' SunTrust bank account, from which they can easily transfer money to and from my account. In fact, despite moving a thousand miles away, where there are no SunTrust banks even remotely near me, I still have this account open so that I can quickly and easily transfer money to or from my parents.<br/> This is no longer my main bank account, but it has served and continues to serve my needs incredibly well.",2018-05-02

In our time with suntrust, we have had a little and then alot in their bank. We where always treated the same way, no matter how much we had or did not have. They have been there for us to help us grow and prosper throughout our time with them. I think the mobile app is top notch, first class. Never had an glitches or anything. I use it daily and have been glad to have the easy access to our accounts. I think they are on the cutting edge of tech and security.

3289,Service is Unavailable,32105,247,SunTrust Bank,48392,3,"This institution is known for their lack of compassion with their customers. On multiple occasions I have reached out to them on bogus charges concerning my checking account. If they are available they offer an explanation of ""we will refund"" and never a reason as to why this issue is occurring repeatedly. <br/>I often use their on line banking product. As I expect many of their members check their accounts at least once a day it is very inconvenient to use. This is mostly due to the hours they choose to service their on line banking. Without exaggeration I must admit nine times out of ten when I go to check they are offline doing ""scheduled maintenance."" This has been going on for years and not once have I seen a notice telling me when the site would be down. This happens at all hours of the day and tends to last for hours at a time. This is especially frustrating when their telephone customer support line is also closed for the evening. I expect to have access to my account unless they give me warning for maintenance times.",2018-03-07
3290,Superb Customer Service With a Caveat,31764,247,SunTrust Bank,47830,4,"When working with SunTrust over the phone, I have always found the representatives cordial and knowledgeable. Extremely polite to a fault. Wait times are never excessive, and you rarely get either the 'run around' or get asked to be put on hold while they check on something. They appear well trained and can casually facilitate the call and multi-task while reviewing your account with you. That's the key phrase, with you. This was a time that I had to call them when I was travelling. I used my debit card in another State which fraud flagged it. Instead of me calling them, they called me. I appreciated that policy as it prevented a very awkward moment if I tried to use the card again. I appreciate the additional security with my checking account and savings accounts. <br/> <br/>The local branch is another story, as it is fairly run down and not big enough to handle the amount of volume it receives, especially on Monday's and Friday's. I tend to use their notary public service and the wait time can be up to 30 minutes just to speak with someone. When you do speak with someone, the are definitely genial and efficient. A signed notary form or deposit takes under two minutes total time when you are there. As I am in there often making deposits, inside or at the drive through, I can at least credit them for that. Cost and fees are fairly typical for a regional bank, so nothing excessive and nothing overly generous. Minimum deposits may be an issue for some people on the better savings accounts <br/> <br/>Their website is also poorly designed and developed, and looks more like a glorified brochure. The account management section is perhaps the worst I've used as it routinely logs you out. It does not use two-factor-authentication properly and should immediately detect a new IP and require a text or email to complete the log-in. <br/> <br/>Overall not a bad financial institution, though they could work on some things.",2018-02-15

It was extremely helpful, using Suntrust and Nationwide online banking was easy, fast, and efficient. I would highly recommend anyone to use online banking because of how easy it is.

Then received a call from Karrie Miller stating my account would not be opened and funds were being returned to me via PAPER CHECK. This was my first problem. Why am I being sent a paper check when funds were sent electronically. Ok whatever I had to wait 10 days. Waited the 10 days no check. Called Karrie back now I’m being told I have to wait 14 days. So I wait 14 more days still no check. This time I called the 800 number since they actually sent me paper checks with my company name printed on the front of them and an actual bank statement!! I spoke with an agent who told me the account was open but would be closed in five days so guess what I did? Wrote two checks for bills I needed to pay and SUNTRUST refused to pay the checks! I feel scammed discriminated against mislead and taken advantage of! I have never been treated so badly by a bank and am so upset over the additional fees I’ve accumulated by trusting this business please beware!

I was told it would take up to 10 days to receive my debit card, it was here in 6. I also received a few checks should I need them. Since opening the account I couldn't be more pleased.

I spoke with five different representatives, none of whom could direct me to a supervisor or anyone who might know the process well enough to help.

This began as a matter of convenience and has grown into being my bank of choice for all my products.I know that my accounts are handled professionally and their advice is always sound. This small branch offers services I had to pay for before. I get things notarized, and documents requiring more official verification are done there as well. They know me by name and I'm always greeted warmly.

Any phone conversation with the representatives were always very professional and I was more than satisfied with the service and expertise of the employees.

They said I needed to contact the financial institutions that initially sent the money. I asked what I was supposed to say as of course I had no account information and wasn't their client. I asked where the money was that was received, NO ANSWER. I asked if she was insinuating they had returned the funds to the originator and if that is why she was asking me to call those banks and she said she had no information regarding such. I had a customer contact Suntrust 3 days after paying for an order and say they did not initiate the wire. I provided 30 or so pages of documentation and communication for over a month with 4 different employees from that company - AMPLE PROOF they did in fact send the wire - an email directly from the owner confirming that and could not get ANYONE in the fraud department to review the paperwork. The customer wanted to cancel the order which was fine but they lied and said the wire was not authorized. I will be happy to provide ALL of this documentation. A suntrust Branch manager told me concretely MULTIPLE times that any funds coming in would be disbursed at the time of closing the account. She said I would have a bank certified check within 5 - 10 business days. That money is contractually obligated. I must fulfill those contracts by May 25, 2017 and they require a 4 week production time. Any and all Liability is now on Suntrust Bank. They are putting me out of business and CRIMINALLY STEALING MONEY.",2017-05-17

3305,Outstanding Financial Institution,24311,247,SunTrust Bank,31289,5,"I am fortunate enough to be able to say I have been a customer of Suntrust Bank since my days at Ft. Lee Army base in Virginia. That goes back to 1991 and many things have taken place in my financial life since I first opened an checking and savings account at Suntrust.<br/> <br/>My wife at the time attempted to clean out my checking and savings account at Suntrust so she could run off with her boyfriend back in 1993. Before the bank would give her the funds she was trying to take, I received a call from my banker letting me know what was in the process of taking place. I immediately headed to the bank and stopped the transactions she was attempting to make. Had I not gotten that call, I would of had about $125 to my name but, thanks to the concern of my local banker, my funds were intact. Suntrust helped me make an arrangement with my then about to be ex wife to get the funds she was authorized to have.<br/> <br/>In 2007, I was in Lake Tahoe, California on vacation. I headed across the border to Billy's Casino in Stateline Nevada. I attempted to get $300 out of my checking account and when I saw the cashier, I was told it was going to cost me $39.95 to access my own money. I told them to cancel the transaction. A few days later, I did a check online and discovered that the casino put the charge through and it was removed out of my checking account without my signature. I contacted the bank, they put the funds back into my account and went back to Billy's Casino to resolve the matter. Without their help, I would probably have lost $300.00.<br/> <br/>I rate Suntrust outstanding and I hope the above helps support my rating. Thank you.",2016-07-06
3306,You Can Trust SunTrust,24212,247,SunTrust Bank,31007,4,"I have never had a problem with SunTrust, and they replace your lost debit cards for free. I am giving four stars because I cannot say this is the best bank of all time without ever having set foot in other local banking institutions. However, I can say that their employees are courteous and always make sure to take care of the customer. Although the interest on their saving accounts are low, and there are no extra rewards for banking with them, their savings and checking accounts are easily accessible online or at a local branch. The only thing I can think about to improve is the speed of their transactions - sometimes it actually takes 2-3 days before funds deposited via mobile app appear on a checking account, and sometimes it takes 3-4 days to pay an external bill. Never had a problem with security. Great app and photo-deposit option.",2016-06-23

Check deposits are timely and ATM usage is easy. Regionally there are enough ATMs to service me in this area. The bank workers are friendly and helpful and a variety of loan options and credit options are available, as well as CDs, regular savings, and checking accounts. Fraud protection is very good as well. The one and only issue I have is the website and more specifically, the mobile site, which simply doesn't work all the time. The website is occasionally down for maintenance, but the mobile site is worse and sometimes you just cannot get on! I like that the bank will link easily with Mint. Still, better than most banks in this area and quite easy to use.",2016-06-02

I'm done with banks, I'll buy a safe, that way I'm not paying for my own money, no fees. Everything is free!!!!! These banks think their so clever. If they so clever, why do the bank allow someone to go in debt? Just like Metro PCS, you not bout to owe them nothing. They won't allow nothing to be not paid.

I immediately called Suntrust and explained what happened. Long story short, after a month, the bank decided that they had ""lost"" his check. and were going to take 460.00 of our hard earned money. I don't know about you but we live pay check to pay check. After multiple attempts to resolve the issue. All they could do was shift the blame onto the payroll company. But only after a month of associates saying that the claim was closed and that everything was resolved, all of a sudden they decide that they ""lost the check"" WTF is that. I mean We have the pay stub, the atm location, the time of the transaction, blah blah blah. Extremely disappointed , changing banks tomorrow morning. Beware ALL, Stay Away",2016-02-08
3312,DO NOT Bank At Suntrust,22457,247,SunTrust Bank,26009,1,"Long story short......Do not bank at Suntrust. They will hit you with overdraft fees by manipulating your account to show as a negative, when it actually had a positive balance. I had a remaining balance of 10.00, Suntrust did an overdraft fee of 36.00 that put me in the negative, which then created a trickle down affect. That caused me 108.00 in fees.

But since opening this new account we have had nothing but trouble. They put double charges on our account then say it is the merchants fault we call the merchants and they show only one. So the bank says they will refund us. Then they I over draft my account a month later saying oh it was just a hold. Bs.... so we are going back to Bank of America.,2015-09-03
3314,How I Feel About Suntrust,21723,247,SunTrust Bank,24208,4,"Suntrust is a fairly local bank with its own mobile app and easy-to-use deposit system. Each time I go grocery shopping, I just open the Suntrust mobile app and check my balance to ensure I have enough to spend at the grocery store. Although its deposit/withdrawal system is easy to understand and use, there are not many Suntrust banks, as they keep closing due to mobile access--which forces many to use the app, which isn't bad--but it's hard to adjust to.",2015-07-07
3315,Suntrust Is Untrust,21633,247,SunTrust Bank,24028,1,"I had $7,646 stolen out of my IRA by SunTrust. They admitted that they put it back in my IRA. However when I checked to find the balance, it was not there. Apparently, they created a new IRA and put it there. Why? They are being sued left and right. I have asked for documentation on the transaction, as it can only be done at the branch. The branch is refusing to give it to me. I do have proof, however, that they forged my name on 2 other documents. Their real name is UNTrust and the ""S"" stands for....well....you fill it in.",2015-06-27
3316,Great Customer NO-Service,21493,247,SunTrust Bank,23837,1,"I have 2 bank accounts. 1 with BofA that I opened when I worked for them in 1999 and last year I opened an account with SunTrust thinking that I may eventually change banks (a real pain in the ass because of BillPay/Automatic BillPay.) and move away from BofA all together. I move money back and forth between the accounts as needed... Mostly to SunTrust since my plan was to eventually make them my only bank. Without fail SunTrust will hold my funds for 3 days before I have full access to them, which has caused me so overdraw a couple of times (at a $35 charge from SunTrust), or had online BillPay refused for insufficient funds, causing me more fees and late fees from those I am trying to pay. Yes, I know that banking laws say that it ""could take up to 3 days"" for funds to move between banks. Using electronic transfer I can push money from BofA to SunTrust or can pull from BofA from SunTrust. It doesn't matter which way I do it, SunTrust doesn't make the funds available for 3 days. HOWEVER, BofA shows the funds as gone the day of the transfer. To get around this I have found that I get faster access to my money (or at least part of it) if I actually write a check to myself from BofA and deposit it into SunTrust. Even with that, SunTrust puts a hold on part of my funds, even though BofA has already sent the funds to SunTrust. How do I know? The electronic image of my check is available online at BofA the very next day. If I do the reverse and move money from SunTrust to BofA, SunTrust does not release the funds for 3 days but BofA (after verifying the funds are there) makes the money available to me same day. What do I pay for this wonderful service? At SunTrust - $7.50/month unless I run 10 transactions through the account. At BofA? $0.00 with no stipulations. Totally FREE checking. <br/><br/>I understand exactly what SunTrust is doing from a ""business"" standpoint. They are using my money, free of charge, for the legal limit. However, from a ""customer service"" standpoint, they suck. A prime example of the bottom line taking precedence over your customers. This is why I will never keep more then the minimum amount necessary in SunTrust. I may even look for someone else for my second account. Hey SunTrust... Way to take care of your customers!!",2015-06-12
3317,Suntrust is a good balance of local bank with national features,21353,247,SunTrust Bank,23589,4,"I've been with Suntrust for over 15 years, now, and I continue to be reasonably pleased with their service. I enjoy having the national bank features such as mobile banking, bill pay, and mobile deposit, but while still being able to go into a local branch and deal with friendly tellers and loan officers if needed. <br/> <br/>I find Suntrust's rates to be reasonably competitive, though it would always be nice to be able to earn a little more interest on my money. I also find Suntrust branches to be conveniently located -- I never have to drive terribly far to find a branch or an ATM if I need one. It's easy to open a new account if needed, and Suntrust offers a variety of savings accounts, CDs, money market plans, etc. to choose from.<br/> <br/>I have received many offers to switch banks, but I stick with Suntrust.

They have always helped me in a time of need and will answer any and all questions that I have in regards to banking with them. I have a student account with Suntrust and this means that as long as I have a minimum of $300 in the bank, I will not be charged any fees. This is really great because I use my debit card for many different reasons and I would really hate to have unnecessary fees. If I happen to fall below the $300 minimum, they only take a $4 fee for that month! I have asked them to review a fee and explain to me why I was charged and what I could do to prevent this from happening in the future. The bank teller told me of many different types of accounts that I can have set up to avoid fees. Personally, the student account is my best option. I have had to go there for help on establishing my financial aid (paper work and a notary) which I got situated at the bank then later brought to the school. They are always nice and friendly and they are the best for my financial needs.",2015-02-11
3321,Satisfied Customer for over 10 years!,20140,247,SunTrust Bank,21924,4,"My current bank is Suntrust. When I first opened my account with them, they were under a different name - CCB. I was 18 years old, and this was my first checking account. I've been with them ever since, and have never had any problems or complaints. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>There is one teller in particular who always calls us by name and asks specific personal questions. You can tell she takes an interest in their customers. She is awesome! Once, our debit card info. was stolen, and I was telling her about it. She happened to remember another customer from earlier in the day have the same thing happen and asked us to mention a few places we used that card. We told her, and one restaurant in particular stuck out. The other customer that was a victim went there also! We were able to alert the restaurant owner, and they tracked down the employee and fired him. It was all because of the teller that took a genuine interest in her customers. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>I'll never forget, one time, around Christmas, a charge went through that I wasn't expecting. This caused almost $200 in overdraft fees alone. I was so stressed out. I called their CS to see if there was anything they could do. They told me that as a one time courtesy, they could waive those fees. Talk about an answered prayer! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>Also, every time there has been suspicious activity on my account, they've alerted me. We were almost a victim of ID theft 2-3 times, and their monitoring caught it before it was too late. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>I have nothing but good things to say about them. I'll continue to be a loyal customer as long as they're in business!",2015-02-11

Their ATMs are super user friendly and very intuitive, and I have never had an issue with putting money in the bank or resolving my issues.

They helped me to apply for and recieve a secure credit card to help build my credit score. Later, they provided me with a small loan so that I could purchase a new car. Even though my credit score was poor, they approved me for a low interest loan due to the fact that I had been a loyal customer in the past. Their loan specialists are very skilled and professional, and seem to have a real affinity for helping the customer. About two years ago, I had my debit card stolen. Suntrust put a hold on the card immediately, and I wasn't responsible for any of the fraudulent charges that had been made up until that point, I was very relieved by the actions that they took to resolve the situation. Suntrust charges a very reasonable fee to maintain a checking account, and if you also open a savings account with them, they will waive the maintenance fee.

I noticed as soon as I moved that the closest branch to my area was not in the best area, and although that is okay, with in the confinements of my car, its not okay when I am walking around with business accounts cash flow, which is sometimes over five thousand dollars. I love their tellers and the down to earth feeling of the branch, even though the building was kind of old, its okay because its in a historical district and has history. I do not however like the homeless that hang out in that area and pan handle in front of the bank. I may have caught it at a bad time,but I feel like its always like that in that area.

I immediately called Suntrust and agreed to pay $25 to have a new debit card overnighted to me, as I was scheduled to fly back to my home in Texas just 3 days later on Saturday evening. I was very happy to pay the $25 for overnight shipping to my hotel in California. The debit card didn't arrive on Friday though as it was supposed to. I called suntrust to see what happened and was told that they don't even offer overnight shipping on cards. Only 2 to 3 BUSINESS days. Which means that myy card was on it's way to california scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, which my flight back home to Texas is three days PRIOR on Saturday. Obviously I was livid, and demanded a refund of the $25 and to talk to a manager. I was told there were no managers there and that one would call me the next day. Of course, nobody from suntrust called me the next day. So i called back on Sunday from my home in texas and spoke to a manager finally. This manager tells me that it is going to be delivered to my hotel in California on tuesday. She refused to listen to the recorded phone call where i was lied to about the overnight shipping and she refused to give me a refund. She said I would need to call back again on Monday to talk to customer service and have them refund the fee. She also wanted to charge me $25 AGAIN to have yet another sent to me in texas at my home, since I'm back from vacation now. I told them to keep the damn card and withdrew all my money and switched financial institutions for good. This was the worst experience of my life in dealing with a bank.

3338,Overdraft Questions,12575,247,SunTrust Bank,11910,2,"So my wife and I have been living pretty tight for a few years. Every now and then we will overdraft our account and suntrust obviouslly charges us a $36 overdraft fee. I have called several times to speak with them b/c in back a few years ago when the banks were required to ask if their customer if they accepted or declined overdraft coverages, I DECLINED IT. I was told that was not the case and I have not really put up a big fight about it. Well tonight we got hit with a fee and it just didnt seem right on how the debits were arranged to cause this account to overdraft more than once.<br/><br/> I am quite frustrated with this and I decieded to research my decision to decline the service. Well I found the setting in my account that shows if you are enrolled or not and all my accounts have DECLINED checked and it gives a date as to when this decision was made and the date is 8/13/2010.<br/><br/> My question is now what. They have covered atleast 15 overdrafts over the past 2 years and I never agreed to this service. Infact I declined it b/c my thought was I would rather be declined then charged $36 per transaction. Should I go after all these charges b/c I declined this service and will I have a good case with them.<br/><br/> I dont know where to start but if I can stick it to them for doing this I would love to. We are talking about over $500 worth of fees that I didnt authorize. Any suggestions?",2013-02-13
3339,Why Not A Negative Star Option?,10758,247,SunTrust Bank,9748,1,"I have been with Suntrust for the past 12 years.  We've had our ups and downs, but lately it has gotten to the point where I have opened an account at another bank.  When I opened the account, I had a $3000 minimum balance, free checks, free incoming wires, free cashier's checks, free ATM use anywhere in any network, and funds were generally released the next business day.  It was one of the better accounts at the time as far as services go.  In addition, I still received paper statements as well as my actual cancelled checks.<br/><br/> Shortly after opening the account, I quit receiving statements in the mail.  For over a year, I had no statements, no online visibility of my account, and had to go to Suntrust every month to get them to print a statement.  Since I was not signed up for image checks, there was no way to get copies of the cancelled checks.  Because of that, I was essentially forced to enroll in image checks, which I did.  It wasn't the end of the world and I knew eventually that would be the only option.  Finally, I had visibility of my account online as well as the ability to print statements. But, still no image checks visible online.  I would still have to go to the bank each month to get them to print my image check pages out.  After a few months, they decided they wanted to start charging me $5/month to get my image checks from them.  Well, if they actually mailed them or made them visible online, there would be no need for me to go into the bank and get copies.  I went rounds with them for several months and they finally told me they would continue to do it for free as long as I kept a minimum $5000 balance.  So, I did that.  <br/><br/> Eventually they added Bill Pay online, which was great.......except every check they mailed out on my behalf had the wrong checking account number on it, so all of those checks the first month bounced all over town as a ""closed account.""  I spent 2 days picking up bad checks and paying fees and paying cash to keep from getting utilities cut off.  All of this because Suntrust printed the wrong checking account number on the checks they themselves mailed out on my behalf.  They profusely apologized and refunded the fees I had to pay to various people.  Of course, I was still out my time and missed work.  Finally, after enrolling in Bill Pay, I miraculously started receiving copies of image checks both in the mail and online.  Apparently whatever the problem was got corrected at the same time they corrected the account number on the checks they were mailing out.  Nobody could ever explain why I wasn't receiving anything online or in the mail in the past, because everytime they checked the account, all appropriate boxes were checked.  At this point, I didn't care - I was just happy to receive image statements.<br/><br/> Things were fine for a few years and I even went so far as to recommending them to other people.<br/><br/> But about a year ago, things started going downhill again.  The first thing I noticed was the normal 24 hour hold on funds had changed to 3-day.  It then changed to 5-day and on some items even 7-day.  Then, they instituted a 2-day hold on cash deposits.  Cash?  Ok, I can deal with that as I never ever get close to the minimum balance required in the account.  However, I did question them at one time over the new hold policy on checks and they lied to me and said it had always been that way.  Apparently I'm an idiot who has no clue what has been going on in their bank account the past 10 years or so.  <br/><br/>They have since made additional changes to the terms and have instituted additional fees with no notification.  Just in the past few months, I've been hit with a check printing fee, numerous ATM fees while on vacation and using a non-Suntrust ATM (something that had never been a problem in the past), and an in-coming wire fee.<br/><br/> Enough is enough.  ",2012-09-19

About 5 years ago, after my Dad passed away and my mom's health began to decline I began handling their finances. I was so impressed with the employees at one of the branches in Florence, Alabama that I was seriously considering moving my personal finances to SunTrust. I found the employees to be helpful, efficient, and professional; however, on a few occasions, due to convenience, I had to visit another branch of SunTrust in Florence, AL and was amazed at the difference in the service. I was shocked to see individuals who work there with tattoos on their necks, unprofessional attire, and reputations in the community that are revoking. It was obvious that some of the male and female employees had relationships that went beyond the work setting. I felt so insulted that after my experiences, I moved most of my mom's affairs to other institutions or investments. She continues to have a few of accounts with SunTrust, but when the time is right, I will close those accounts as well. I will say however, that the original branch in Florence continues to exhibit a professional atmosphere; however, I'm sure it is just a matter of time that the standards will decline there as well, whether it is from a transfer from the neighboring branch, or poor judgment within management when interviewing and hiring personnel.",2012-08-25

I opened an account for my then foster daughter to implement Independent Living and guide her in the right direction. To make a long story short, one of her so-called friends handed her a check from a closed account. Mind you, the check was clearly written out for One Hundred Fifty and No cents ($150) however, someone decided to write another (1) in front of the amount, making the total $1,150. Now if the teller took the time to ""LOOK"" at the check, she would've noticed the descrepancy. Not only that, my daughter barely had $100 in her account. Instead, the teller easily distributed the money no questions asked. The $1,150 was taken out of ""MY"" account and Suntrust Bank didn't want to hear a damn thing I had to say because they got their money. My foster daughter of course received an ear full, her checking account was closed shortly after and her so-called friends were not allowed to step foot in my driveway.

3348,A Nightmare,7580,247,SunTrust Bank,5767,1,"I went into Suntrust on December 29, 2011 to open a Checking Account. AThe Teller opened the account and took my payroll check as my first deposit. The Teller was very attentive and very helpful at that time. She explained to how to setup my online banking and also told me that I would be able to see the deposit online the following day Friday December 30, 2011, but the funds would not be available until Satuday morning December 31,2011.  Here's where it gets interesting! Keep in mind I deposited my paycheck. When I received the access code to setup my Online Banking on Friday morning, I was able to get into my account. However, the balance was 0 and the deposit I made the night before with my payroll check was not there. A little puzzled.... I contacted the bank and spoke with the Teller that opened my account and explained to her that the deposit from the previous night was not reflected in my account. The Teller was not as attentive and helpful as she was the night before. As a matter of fact, she rushed me off the phone and told me that I would not see the deposit unitl Saturday morning, even though she told me on Thursday that I would see it on Friday. On Saturday morning I tried logging into my Online Banking and received error messages after trying to login 5 times to no avail I contacted the 1-800# for the Onlne Banking Customer Service Dept and the Customer Support person told me that my account was closed on Friday because it did not pass the verification process????? I was perplexed and dismayed because I was never told by the teller that such a process existed and you would think that something like that would come up while your opening the account at the Branch, not 2 days later. Not to mention I never received a phone call or email stating that Suntrust had closed the account for whatever reason.  Okay peolple.... I'm now LIVID and BROKE on New Years Eve! I just wanted my paycheck back. So I went back to the Branch to get my check back. However, Suntrust gave me the finger once again. I was told that they COULD not release my paycheck or give me any of my money because the ""Department"" that release said funds was closed until Tuesday, January 2, 2012. I wonder if they will give me back my paycheck with interest.  It is now January 5th 2012 and I'm still waiting on Suntrust Bank to return my paycheck from 12/29/11. I received nothing...... I know one thing for certain, the 2 branches in Douglasville are in need of new management. The branch managers are incompite Their customer services skills are non-existing. The Arbor Place, Douglasville, Ga branch manager Andrea Woods is an absolute waste. My husband and I spent an hour in the bank pleading with the Service Rep. For help with our issue, to the point that I was in tears. She walked past us, stood next to us as she was discussing her holiday with one of the other workers. She could clearly hear everything we were saying to the Service Rep., she didn't even acknowledge our situation. Never even offered to assist us in any way. In other words she completey ignored us! Oh yeah! To this day... No letter, no phone call or an email from Suntrust telling me that they closed the account. BEWARE! THIS IS THE WORST BANK EVER!",2012-01-05

I asked them why the big change and several branches said that it was to improve their relationship with the customer. How can taking advantage of me needing to use my own money by charging me and not considering my long term commitment with them make for a good relationship. NO WAY!!!! They just want to use my $500. And don't care that our jobs do not offer direct deposit. Well so be it. They are just a loan SHARK just like the rest of the big banks. I will go to a community bank and be treated with respect.

Part of the process involves securing bank statements for the past five years. Since my mother has six bank accounts, we had the experience of dealing with six different banks. The customer service at most of these was friendly and accommodating. Two banks provided the statements for free and mailed them to us. In contrast, the customer service representative at SunTrust was officious and even rude. Moreover, SunTrust charges $5 for each back statement and, at this exploitative rate, requires that you return to the bank at a later date to retrieve them.
